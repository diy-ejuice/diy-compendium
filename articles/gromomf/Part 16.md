Starting flavor count: 2,753 (down from 2,975 originally)

TASK OR TRASH - Each flavor gets assigned at least one task or it goes in the trash.

## Elli’s

Elli’s is a German flavor company, these flavors were sent to me by my friend Felix all the way from Germany.

**Baklava**

Can’t remember whether I tried this or not, will mix a sample at 0.75% **TASK 1**

**Dattel**

It is not great. It tastes like reaching into grandma’s dusty candy bowl and pulling out a purple grape hard candy covered in dust. Very strong, sweet flavor, bold, but really tastes a lot like musty dusty grape candy and not a date. Somehow too many of these flavor people seem to have gotten it into their heads that dates taste kind of like grape candy, but they are wrong and should be force-fed dates until they die of date overdose as punishment. **TRASH 1**

**Feige**

Extremely sweet, mostly fresh fig flavor but with strong enough hints of grape and cherry candy to ruin it. It could be that 1.5% was too high. This is a really bold flavor, and maybe loses the grape candy and cherry candy hints if dropped lower. I will mix a 0.5% sample. **TASK 2**

**Traube Rot**

Possibly overflavoring at 2%, I will try again at 0.5%. **TASK 3**

2% tastes like lightly perfumed grape fun dip. I don’t mind a good grape fun dip flavor but I prefer them without any perfume. I really don’t have high hopes for this one turning out to be some kind of hidden gem, but will give it a shot anyway.

**Lakritz**

A spicy licorice, rather than an herbal or artificial one. Very anise-y. It’s got hints of cinnamon and ginger in the top notes, even. But it’s still overwhelmingly licorice. Nice sweet molasses base but the flavor is a little thin there, it’s a bit top heavy. Really nothing wrong with it if you’re looking for a spicier licorice. I have other, less spiced licorices that I’m happy with **TRASH 2**

**Rosmarin**

Pretty weird, I can definitely taste Rosemary in there, but also a strong eucalyptus taste, without the menthol that’s usually added to eucalyptus, with hints of rosy floral and sweet lemon. It’s actually more interesting and complex of a single flavor than just a straight rosemary would be, but probably deeply limited in usability because of all these odd sort of side dishes of flavor that are going on in there. I don’t know what the hell to do with it. Maybe there’s some kind of Mediterranean dessert I’ve never heard of that you need a rosemary-lyptus-lemon-rose flavor to complete, maybe. Full flavored at 0.5%. **TRASH 3**

## Euro Flavor

**Blue Raspberry**

Bolder flavor for a blue raspberry, really tastes like blue raspberry candy, tangy and sweet. It tastes a little chemical at 6% - like a hint of toilet bowl cleaner, but 3% was a much lighter flavor - there’s probably a sweeter spot for it somewhere between 3 and 6%.
Both concentrations have fairly prominent odd kinda dry powdery or chalky base, like one of those Bottle Cap candies (although I don’t think those come in blue razz) or SweetTart type of situation, with an above average blue raspberry top note. That base could limit its use but it could also be perfect for some things. I’ll mix a sample at 4.5% and see if it’s possible for it to be boldly flavored without the toilet bowl cleaner off-note. **TASK 4**

**Burley Tobacco**

It’s almost impossible to overstate how terrible this flavor is. I can’t even fathom what the Euro Flavors folks were thinking selling this to people. There’s some raisiny cigarette tobacco with a bit of ash in the middle there, but it’s mostly just a collection of awful. It’s hard to even describe this awfulness, but I can kind of pick out hints of underarm stench, cough syrup, and original yellow Listerine. Just absolutely foul. A pox on this flavor’s house. **TRASH 4**

**Cherimoya**

Weak virgin Banana Pina Colada. It tastes like sweet pineapple without the sharper more acidic part, coconut without the full rich buttery coconut creaminess, and ripe natural banana, all blended together into one thing that’s a soft and a little dry but sweet and not offensive. Just a gentle tropical blob of flavor. Has some body to it but it’s not especially thick or creamy. Because my 5% steeped bottle was so soft and light in flavor, I made quick Shake N Vape at 10% - the banana was buried quite a bit and now it tasted a whole lot like 3% LorAnns Pina Colada, which tastes exactly like a Pina Colada Lifesaver. The pineapple was sweet and a little sharper, and the coconut had a bit of that buttery taste while still tasting artificial. Doesn’t quite have that same hard candy body that a pina colada lifesaver and LA Pina Colada has. And there is still a touch of banana, but it’s just barely there. I don’t know what to do with this, it’s certainly not gonna be gross to anyone who likes pineapple, coconut, and banana, but there are quite a few other custard apple flavors I’d rather play with, given the option. **TRASH 5**

**Energy Green**

Essentially just two things: jolly rancher (mostly) with a little energy drink flavor.
Doesn’t really taste like OG Green Monster. It’s about like drinking a sip of Red Bull with a couple of green apple jolly ranchers in your mouth. Texturally just kind of a sweet, flat, smooth flavor, not that distinctive hard candy thing or a fizzy-powdery drink. Another perfectly pleasant but weird flavor from EF that I don’t know what to do with. **TRASH 6**

**Energy Red**

Sweet powdery generic fruity candy with a bubblegum backnote and a slight, not-perfumy floral thing. Like rolling a bit of ABC pink bubblegum in a pile of mixed up pixie stick flavors and eating it, while in a florist shop. Doesn’t really taste like Red Bull or even an energy drink flavor at all, though the indiscernible mixed fruit candy plus bubblegum thing has a lot in common with energy drink flavors. Perfectly pleasant to vape, but weird and I don’t know what to do with this. The hint of floral reminds me of TFA Honeysuckle so maybe something of a bridge between Honeysuckle and a fruit, or an ingredient in some kind of really weird bubblegum recipe.

Fuck it, lets mess with honeysuckle and make a really weird bubblegum recipe in the same motherfukin place at the same motherfukin time.

Honeysuckle Chew V1 **TASK 5**

| Co. | Flavor              | %    |
| --- | ------------------- | ---- |
| EF  | Energy Red          | 5    |
| TFA | Honeysuckle         | 2    |
| TFA | Honeydew            | 0.25 |
| MB  | American Bubble Gum | 3    |
| VT  | Bubble Gum Base     | 2    |

I’m borrowing the bubblegum combo from [Daki](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/270433), thanks Wolfwheeler!

**Energy Yellow**

Don’t know what specific energy drink this is supposed to taste like, if any, maybe RockStar? But what it actually tastes like is sugary, powdery lemon candy with a light bitter edge and a slight-but-stupid plasticky off note. Sort like a sad, failed copy of VT Fizzy Sherbet. If there was a lemon pixie stick flavor and you ate it wrapper and all, it might taste something like this? **TRASH 7**

**Gingerbread**

There’s something very strange about the spice note on this one. I can sorta maybe tell it’s supposed to be gingerbread or at least ginger, it definitely features ginger and a rich, thick bakery base, but it also seems to have something oddly savory, or like a spice you’d use in something savory, in addition to ginger. Savory and even a little perfumy. Like curry powder or something. It’s weird, and fairly strong, enough that I think it totally ruins the flavor. Also, not much base to speak of, it’s top-heavy and thin. **TRASH 8**

**Grape**

It tastes intensely rotten. It’s sweet and a little tart and not one of the many flavors that just taste like purple. It tastes like a real purple grape, complete with both skin and a sweet thick juicy inside, but rotten, like a grape covered in mold. It’s nasty. **TRASH 9**

**Green Mango**

I don’t think I’ve tried this one. I’ll mix a sample at 1%, because someone on ELR said 2% was really strong with lots of throat hit. **TASK 6**

Not really a fan of green mango flavors in general, but if you show me a recipe that otherwise looks good and has some green mango in there, I’d give it a try. I found not just one: “[Jango 2](https://e-liquid-recipes.com/recipe/2004668/Jango%202)” **TASK 7** But two: [Italian Green Mango](https://e-liquid-recipes.com/recipe/444949/Italian%20Green%20Mango) **TASK 8** such recipes, both by [Darth Vapor](https://e-liquid-recipes.com/?filter=22113)

**Nougat**

It tastes like equal parts honey and moldy sawdust. It’s very sweet and the sweetness tastes a lot like honey, but it’s chalky and woody and there’s an undercurrent of moldiness like the smell that hits you when you turn over an old log in the woods. I don’t know, someone might find a use for that, but I don’t want anything to do with it. **TRASH 10**

**Plum**

Plum Candy. I knew when I tried EF Plum at 2 and 4% there would be a sweet spot in the middle where it didn’t taste weak like it did at 2% and didn’t taste just a little like air freshener like it did at 4%. I was right, 3% is the sweet spot. It’s not a natural plum, but it tastes a lot like this mouthwatering sweet plum gummy candy I had once. It’s kind of a soft flavor though, I wish it could be bolder. I don’t want to mess with this anymore, after those three samples I had my fill of it. **TRASH 11**

**Ripe Papaya**

It tastes like someone put microwave popcorn residue all over some kind of tropical fruit. It has a bit of that fake butter taste right on top, along with a honey-sweet but unclear tropical fruit that I guess could be a papaya, like a part-mango part-melon with a bit of citrus brightness. Whatever they tried to do to make it taste ripe comes across tasting remarkably like microwave popcorn butter to me. **TRASH 12**

**Rose**

Almost straight up grandma’s perfume, really what I’d expect, but not hope, for a Rose flavor to taste like. If you’re not a fan of floral flavors and are thinking that vaping rose sounds horrible, this is what you’re probably imagining. High floral perfume, clearly rose but with hints of lilac or lavender or something pushing it even deeper into perfume territory versus something like rose water or rose syrup. Some tartness, but not much. A little dry sweetness behind it but mostly just perfume, not like a rose candy. **TRASH 13**

**Tobacco Chocolate**

I guess this is fine, except for the part where it’s called Tobacco Chocolate and at 6% I don't really get either. It’s mostly just nondescript sweet nothing. There’s something very lightly milk chocolate-esque so I can see where they were going for chocolate but it is just barely there, and I think this light earthy dryness that it has might be trying to pass itself off as tobacco, but really misses the mark. **TRASH 14**

**Vanilla Custard**

Candy sweet French vanilla upfront with some milky cream underneath it and some darker sweetness in the middle. Tastes about what I’d imagine a vanilla-pudding flavored lollipop would be like, except for that odd dark and syrupy sweetness right in the middle that tastes like Karo dark corn syrup. Strange, sticky sweetness, not quite sugar lips, but close. Has a creamy dairy flavor but more of a sticky, hard candy mouthfeel than a custardy richness, and even a bit of that hairspray sort of off-note you get with too much FW Hard Candy. Maybe a slight buttery flavor but no eggy thing here. I could have some fun with this but that is in no way a custard, and I could almost clone it with CAP French Vanilla and FW Hard Candy. You know what, before I go tossing this, I might just do that.

French Vanilla Hard Candy V1 **TASK 9**

| Co. | Flavor         | %    |
| --- | -------------- | ---- |
| CAP | French Vanilla | 2.25 |
| FW  | Hard Candy     | 0.5  |
| FA  | Oba Oba        | 1    |
| CAP | Super Sweet    | 0.5  |

I just want to see if that’s better than EF Vanilla Custard. It’s definitely going to be similar.

**Woodruff**

1% tastes like a weird cherry lollop or maybe a cherry cough drop without the menthol that you’d expect in a cough drop. Candy sweet and tastes cherry-ish, but with an herbal quality that’s unfamiliar to me. More herbal than floral but if you told me it was supposed to be a cherry blossom tea flavor I wouldn’t be surprised. Seriously tastes like just add some menthol and a little INW Euc with mint, just a little bit of another maybe INW Cherries, and you’ve got yourself a solid cherry cough drop vape. Probably with the EF Woodruff a little higher, 1% seems a little soft. 2% - Same as 1%, just a little bolder. 4% - Very busy flavor, very interesting. Still basically the same, menthol-less herbal cherry cough drop. But a lot more going on. Pretty sweet, with hints of vanilla and cinnamon-like spice. I don’t know what to do with it it up this high, seems like 2 maybe 3% is where it tops out as far as being useful for cherry cough drop vape. But interesting, and not plasticky or otherwise unpleasant. Just cherry, herbal, vanilla, cinnamon, sweetness. I would say mix it with a tobacco but the cherry seems awfully artificial and candyish for that.

Someone has put it in a tea, I’ll give that a try before I chuck it: [ACME Chai Harder](https://e-liquid-recipes.com/recipe/4109619/ACME%20Chai%20Harder). **TASK 10**

**Yellow Mango**

Underripe yellow peach, lemon pledge, and pinesol, with very little of a sort of funky mango flavor. Maybe a bit over flavored at 3%, I’ve heard some people like this one a lot. I don’t have much hope for it, but I’ll try again at 1.5% and see. **TASK 11**

## Faerie’s Finest

**Black Currant**

Soapy. And oddly a little smoky, like charred wood, but these are just slight off-notes in what otherwise tastes like grape-raspberry candy. Don’t know about you, but I like my grape-raspberry candy without soap and smoke. **TRASH 15**

**Blackberry**

I guess that tastes like blackberry, more or less, but it’s harsh. There’s some tartness on top but it’s out of proportion with how rough that is on the old throat. Beyond that, it’s not very flavorful. It’s sweet, but fairly thin, without as much going on there. If something’s gonna be Throat Razors it should at least have some really good flavor to make up for it. **TRASH 16**

**Blue Raspberry**

Does taste like blue raspberry up front, but very soft and more than a little soapy. I don’t know why it’s so hard to make blue raspberry flavor that vapes with some punch to it, or why so many of them taste soapy to me. **TRASH 17**

**Burnt Sugar**

Baby powder. FF Brown Sugar tasted like WF Champagne Soda, which tastes like baby powder, mixed with FA Caramel, which tastes halfway between brown sugar and caramel. YUCK! **TRASH 18**

**Cream Soda**

Haven’t tried this. I’ll mix a 2% sample. **TASK 12**

**Grape**

I don’t think I’ve tried this. 2% sample again. **TASK 13**

**Mango**

Surprisingly, not too bad. Besides being more like nectarine with a hint of pine in the air rather than a full, ripe, authentic mango, it’s a little soft, possibly needing a higher concentration than I tried (3.5%), but really pleasant. Pleasant, but a subpar mango. **TRASH 19** is where those go.

**Plum**

Plum with a splash of prune juice and oatmeal. Fresher stone fruit to start, quickly replaced with a sweet but musty prune/raisin flavor but not dry. A very light amount of a weird cereal taste, but also not dry. Soggy, reminiscent of oatmeal. **TRASH 20**

**Pomegranate**

Tastes like FA Pomegranate but about half as potent and a little less vibrant, but a little juicier. I can’t think of a reason not to use it but I can’t think of a reason to use it either, when FA is a readily available option that does a better job of doing the pretty much the same thing. **TRASH 21**

**Pumpkin**

Powdered sugar with soft pumpkin and clove backnotes. Reminds me a lot of OoO Powdered Sugar, which is an excellent flavor, but like, what would happen if you ruined it by adding some authentic pumpkin flavor and a teensy bit of clove. I’m kind of joking when I say “ruined” because it was pleasant enough and seems like this could be usable to add some pumpkin into a bakery, like a pumpkin-infused cupcake type situation. That dry sweet confectioner's sugar tastes like it would do fine as an icing component and there’s enough pumpkin here to give a cake some pumpkinness, you’re just going to want to supplement the clove with some nutmeg, cinnamon, and ginger. You’ll wind up using a bunch of ingredients and where two or three better ingredients probably do the job, and no one will want to try your recipe, but it’s not a “bad” flavor at all. Just not one I feel in need of. **TRASH 22**

## Flavor Jungle

Not to be confused with Jungle Flavors, these are one-shots I picked up at Flavor Jungle.

**Apple Fritter**

Nah. It definitely tastes like apple fritter on one hand, very sweet cooked apple and a lot of fried pastry dough, nice hint of spice. The problem is that it is way too yeasty for me, and the yeastiness is kinda funky like skunky beer. It tastes like it’s got a bunch of FA Joy in there. If you are a fan of FA Joy, there’s a good chance you’ll like Flavor Jungle Apple Fritter. It’s not for me, though. It leaves a bad aftertaste in my mouth. You could definitely pretty easily make a better Apple Fritter recipe with just a couple of ingredients. **TRASH 23**

**Just Peachy**
That’s sure enough a peach cheesecake, emphasis on the peach. Like it’s just absolutely covered in peach sauce and brighter chunks of actual peach and maybe some nectarine. If you don’t like cheesecake but do like peaches and cream, it’s worth a try, there’s not too much cheesecake here, just a slightly tangy very rich thickness underneath that pile of peach. Not oversweetened, tastes just right to me. I dunno, I might wind up tossing it before I finish the whole bottle, but I do want to try it again, so I’ll mix some up at 12.5% again. **TASK 14**

**Pumpkin Spice Cheesecake**

I wish it had a better balance of pumpkin spice spices - more cinnamon and ginger, less nutmeg - and a bit less sucralose sweetener, but this comes pretty close to a basic white girl dream come true. Nutmeg-forward pumpkin spice, thick and creamy midsection with a little tang to it, graham crust base, sugar lips finish. I think I could probably make a better one, and someone probably has, but still, this is pretty good, especially if you’re too lazy or too busy to build one from scratch or even pull out a bunch of ingredients and mix someone else’s recipe. I think this is going to be one of those “I’ll throw it away as soon as I prove to myself I can make a better one” flavors, so I guess I’ll get started on that.

P.S. Cheesecake V1 **TASK 15**

| Co. | Flavor               | %    |
| --- | -------------------- | ---- |
| FLV | Pumpkin Spice        | 0.75 |
| VSO | Pumpkin              | 2    |
| INW | Yes We Cheesecake    | 3    |
| CAP | NY Cheesecake        | 3    |
| TFA | Graham Cracker Clear | 2    |
| FLV | Cream                | 1    |
| FLV | Caramel              | 1    |
| FW  | Sweetener            | 0.5  |

**Strawberry Lemonade**

Unbalanced badly in favor of the lemon, and the lemon isn’t great. Lemonheads candy upfront with a slight cleaning product edge to it, and a bit of candyish vague red fruit in the background. Very sweet. I took it to 12% trying to get the strawberry to come out more but it just makes the lemon worse the higher you go. **TRASH 24**

## Flavor Phoenix

**Blackberry Fizz**

It’s got a picture of like clear soda with berries at the bottom of the glass so I guess it’s supposed to taste something like that, but instead it tastes like lemon lime soda, dark berry, and cinnamon. If you had the right blackberry, you could recreate this with just that blackberry, CAP Lemon Lime, and CAP Cinnamon Sugar. You get that powdery cinnamon right on top and then the syrupy lemon lime base dominates, while the blackberry is more of a background flavor. It’s very strange. **TRASH 25**

**Cake Batter**

Not Cake Batter. It tastes like eating a caramel cupcake in a tire shop. The cupcake base part is kind of a moist, maybe undercooked vanilla cupcake, so I can sort of see it as maybe kind of a cake batter. There’s a very sweet caramel on top that reminds me of caramel-flavored frosting, but the inhale tastes like breathing in a tire shop. Not burning tires like the original Flavour Art Pineapple, but just stacks and stacks of new tires, and then it comes back on the end and really lingers. Pretty nasty. **TRASH 26**

**Mango Mamba**

Tastes like a mango melon starburst with a dollop of dish soap. People who aren't as sensitive to things tasting soapy as I am should give it a shot, because it would be pretty good otherwise, but I can’t enjoy it. **TRASH 27**

## Flavor Revolution

**Cantaloupe**

It has some vanilla notes that seem pretty out of place, but worse than that it tastes like they were going for funky ripeness but wound up with slightly spoiled dairy milk instead. So like spoiled vanilla melon milk, which doesn’t really sound good to me. FR Cantaloupe is definitely a melon flavor but not a super authentic cantaloupe, more just a like a generic melon with a lot of milk and a dash of vanilla. Dairy milk upfront, with a slightly dry vanilla cream body, and then a sweet melon finish. It’s not good, mostly because of the tanginess that comes across like spoiled milk. I tried it at 2% and 3% because River Supply said to start and 2% and go up. Going up did not help the situation at all, maybe I should have gone down instead, but at this point, I don't care to find out. **TRASH 28**

**Honeycake**

I didn’t enjoy vaping this because it irritated my throat. Light and bright slightly floral honey flavor (but without the thick gooey heavy honey body) dominates, followed by what seems to be a very stale, dry angel food cake. Tastes like an angel food cake but with all the moisture sucked out. If you don’t find it harsh, could be made to taste more like it’s name with the addition of a moist bakery or work as a honey note addition to a bakery, but it’s gonna taste more like clover honey poured on a bakery rather than baked into it because of its brightness and light floral quality. On a scale of 1 to litterbox, maybe a 2 on the ammonia room note, but not really getting that in the vape. Too harsh for me, though. **TRASH 29**

**Mango**

Kinda odd but not bad. Has a bit of that piney peel mango note, but the body is more like some kind of tropical melon or mango-papaya combination rather than really tasting like a mango. It’s pretty nice to vape if you don’t mind the bit of pine, as it’s very sweet and juicy, but it tastes off to me, because of that funky melon not-really-a-mango thing. **TRASH 30**

**Red Raspberry**

Pretty yucky. It’s flavorful, but I’d rather it not be. It’s different, and not in a good way. It’s like you spilled berry medicine on cotton candy-flavored ice cream. Instead of being floral or perfumy like raspberries tend to go, Flavor Revolution Red Raspberry is bitter and medicinal. It does taste like a red berry, but red berry flavored medicine, and it has a thick, creamy base with a touch of vanilla to it. It’s sweet, with a sweetness that tastes like cotton candy upfront, but it finishes with that lingering bitter aftertaste. **TRASH 31**

**Strawberry Cantaloupe**

This is nice, it doesn’t taste like they just took that yucky Flavor Revolution Cantaloupe and added strawberry to it, but maybe they did and the strawberry part is covering up a lot. It tastes like JF Sweet Strawberry with some not quite authentic cantaloupe behind it. It’s candish - obviously the strawberry up front is a candy strawberry - and the melon behind it tastes like a sweet candy take on a Canary melon or some kind of cantaloupe-honeydew hybrid, with a creamish, taffy-like mouthfeel that fills in more at 2.5% than it did at 2%. Overall, FR Strawberry Cantaloupe makes for a pleasant vape. As an ingredient, might be interesting in anything that combines bright artificial strawberry and any melon. I don’t want to toss it without first trying Daniel’s [Strawberry Cantaloupe](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/212543#strawberry_cantaloupe_by_danielthevapeman) recipe that uses it. **TASK 16**

## Flavor West

I have so many of these to get through, I just wanted to get a tiny head start before putting this edition of GRoMoMF to bed.

**555 Tobacco**

This flavor raises so many questions. Like, why in the hell do I keep trying these FW tobaccos? And, what in the fuck is wrong with me that I keep trying these FW tobaccos? Anyway, it’s disgusting. Mostly nut, little bacco, bit of garbage. No, like, literal garbage, there’s a slight off note here that tastes like the smell of the yuck in the bottom of a dumpster. It’s also rich and creamy, which makes it worse, and sweet, which makes it even worse. The sweetness tastes kinda like honey complete with that sort of cat pee/meth lab off note. So, rich creamy nut with a touch of light tobacco, and hints of dumpster sludge and meth lab. It’ll fit right in with the rest of my **TRASH 32**

New flavor count: 2,721
