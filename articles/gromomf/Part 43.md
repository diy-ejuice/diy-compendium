## CAPELLA

**Gingerbread**

Update. My main reasons for keeping CAP Gingerbread are [Mjuk Pepparakaka](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/206522#mjuk_pepparkaka_by_wallebiela) and [Titanic](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/48608#titanic_by_id10_t). Although I must admit, when I mixed Titanic again recently, I wasn’t as impressed with my creation as I was the last time I had some. Anyway, went looking for another use for CAP Gingerbread. I started with [Pumpkin Cookies](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/209523) by Developed. It’s a very tasty recipe, but not one I feel I need to make again, or at least, not as written. I really didn't expect HS Pumpkin Pie to bring much to the table at 2% other than perhaps some silky volume, but it does somehow kinda taste like a cream cheese-frosted cookie with pumpkin in the dough, which is something I'm familiar with because I make pumpkin snickerdoodles every fall. Seems an essential aspect of pumpkin cookie-ness is missing though, what this could really use is a bit of FLV Pumpkin Spice instead of relying just on CAP Gingerbread for only a hint of spice..
I might mix it again with 0.7% FLV Pumpkin Spice and 0.2% FLV Rich Cinnamon added to see if I can get close to those pumpkin doodle cookies, but the cookie is fairly soft and I’m afraid it’ll get just buried in spice, probably better to attack that project from the ground up, though I definitely learned from this mix to keep HS Pumpkin Pie on my radar for that.

In the meantime, a couple more recipes that might turn out to be additional reasons for keeping CAP Gingerbread.

[Kitty Claws](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/230817#kitty_claws_by_rug_ly). I don’t know that FLV Caramel 0.5% is going to be sufficient darkening for CAP Gingerbread to really be a gingerbread cookie, but I still think all these ingredients look delicious together. **TASK 1**

[Winter Warmth](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/75603#winter_warmth_by_djuna), just four ingredients - CAP Gingerbread, INW Custard, TFA Kentucky Bourbon, TFA Toasted Marshmallow but looks like it probably lives up to its name. That Kentucky Bourbon + Toasted Marshmallow combo is old but still sexy, just like me. **TASK 2**

**Golden Pineapple**

Update. I said I couldn’t get rid of Golden Pineapple until I knew for sure I could make a great [Mango Colada](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/12259#mango_colada_by_id10_t) without it. So I mixed this:

New Mango Colada V1

| Co. | Flavor          | %    |
| --- | --------------- | ---- |
| CAP | Fresh Pineapple | 2    |
| FA  | Coconut         | 1    |
| WF  | Coconut Custard | 1.25 |
| FA  | Jamaican Rum    | 1    |
| FLV | Mango           | 1.5  |
| FLV | Sweet Mango     | 1.5  |

The result is very tasty! But still not where I want it to be (if it was, I’d share the recipe on ATF and in the monthly recipe thread). FLV Mango and FLV Sweet Mango at 1.5% each is a delightful mango combo. The mango part is PERFECT. And I get pineapple, coconut, and a rum finish, without any off-notes. It’s as good as the original recipe, with two fewer ingredients thanks to CAP Fresh Pineapple not needing the help CAP Golden Pineapple and WF Coconut Custard eliminating the need for an added cream flavor. The only problem is balance. It’s very mango-centric, which is fine as far as being tasty, but leaves me wanting just a little more from all the other components. I would also like it to be sweeter, preferably without adding sweetener. I’m going to try again, changing just one ingredient in hope of a sweeter vape overall and a more satisfying coconut cream, and adjusting some concentrations for balance.

New Mango Colada V2 **TASK 3**

| Co. | Flavor          | %    |
| --- | --------------- | ---- |
| CAP | Fresh Pineapple | 2.5  |
| TFA | Coconut Candy   | 1.0  |
| WF  | Coconut Custard | 1.75 |
| FA  | Jamaican Rum    | 1.5  |
| FLV | Mango           | 1.5  |
| FLV | Sweet Mango     | 1.5  |

Even if that gets it done, I’ll want to do some additional tests adding WS-23 for a frozen drink and, separately, VT Light Rum for a boozier version, but this should be a big step in the right direction.

## FLAVOUR ART

**Ice Cream Italian Special**

More like gelato than ice cream (no egg, less buttery fat), milky, with a darker vanilla. It’s not my preferred style of ice cream. I like em custardy, like Braum’s ice cream if you’re within a 300-mile radius of Tuttle, Oklahoma, but don’t tell anyone I said that or they’ll take off my Texas tattoo with a bench grinder for liking Braum’s more than Blue Bell. Still, FA’s Ice Cream is certainly not bad by any means. But do I really need another vanilla cream flavor? I’ve got DOZENS, still, even after getting rid of like 500 flavors. Well, that depends on the recipes. And since I already plan to mix [Honey Butter Ice Cream](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/134228#honey_butter_ice_cream_by_folkart). Looking to see if I could find anything else irresistible:

[Pineapple Cream Soda Float](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/173162#pineapple_cream_soda_float_by_nickevz). I love a good pineapple cream and that looks like it might be one. **TASK 4**

[mlNikon’s Reeses Sundae](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/188936#mlnikon_s_reeses_sundae_by_mixinvixens). WF Chocolate Chunks might be a little dark for Reeses (unless we’re talking the dark chocolate Reeses cups) but VT Toffee Ice Cream might be doing some voodoo in there and regardless, it looks delicious. **TASK 5**

**Indian Mango**

Such a nice flavor that I immediately bought some more as soon as I tried it. It’s peel-free and has a very sweet, almost honeyed finish. Not juicy, but not terribly dry either. Nice slightly tart brighter dop note. Missing quite a bit of that funky tropical ripeness I’m looking for in a mango, but still tastes like mango. It lacks the complexity I’m looking for in both the high and low notes, which makes it taste a little more like a candy mango than a natural one, but that’s not a bad thing, mango-flavored candy is usually fuckin awesome, right? Because of the things it’s missing, I think it might be THE mango for people who think they don’t like mango. I think you could also add some other mango flavors to it and make it fill out the body of a more realistic mango and lend it that lovely finish very easily.

Of course I’m not throwing out FA Indian Mango. I need it for half a dozen recipes by others that I plan to mix, and another half-dozen ideas for recipes of my own. And here’s other half-dozen I’m happy to add:

[Mango Marshmallow](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/272559#mango_marshmallow_by_cam9535). It’s just two flavors, but what a great-looking two flavors to combine. **TASK 6**

[Island Glow](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/310508#island_glow_by_buriedalive). Same two flavors, plus CAP Cantaloupe and a touch of TFA Coconut Candy. **TASK 7**

[Peach Mango Gummy Candy](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/199490#peach_mango_gummy_candy_by_rug_ly). That’s my type. Or one of them, anyway. **TASK 8**

[Pineapple Mango](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/185347#pineapple_mango_by_denske). Dude says the purpose of the recipe is to show how good FA Indian Mango is, and from the looks of it, I believe him. **TASK 9**

[Pango Smoothie](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/219007#pango_smoothie_by_sanctum). Another pineapple-mango recipe, this one combines VT Shisha Mango and FA Indian Special and I’m really interested in finding out how those work together. **TASK 10**

[Melon Mania III](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/284014#melon_mania_iii_by_cam9535). Papaya, melons, and mango. Classic combo, fresh ingredients. **TASK 11**

**Irish Cream**

It’s got woody and boozy top notes on a soft, sweet, marshmallow-like cream base with slight vanilla and a touch of mocha coffee right in the middle. So they’ve put the Irish cream in the coffee for us for whatever reason, sort of, it’s only a little touch of mocha coffee and it might even be more accurate to just say it’s a slightly bitter dark chocolate note. The main difference between 1.5% and 3% is that the top notes at 3% are dry and harsh and more like smoked wood chips that had been soaked in whiskey rather than a light touch of booze, complete with splinters, and the mocha is chalky and a little skunky. It does not get creamer than 1.5%. I’ve enjoyed it in a few recipes before, but not enough to keep it to make them again, and I don’t see anything new I want to mix with it. **TRASH 1**

**Jacote Plum**

So you have to go into it knowing that Jacote plum doesn’t taste like a regular plum and isn’t supposed to. Apparently jacote plum or Spanish plum is a Central America/Costa Rica/Carribean fruit that has been described as tasting like a cross between a plum and a mango. This tastes like a cross between a plum and a mango. It’s very unique and a little hard to describe. FA Jacote Plum is very sweet throughout but doesn’t taste candied. At 1.5%-2% right up front it’s a little peachy, in the same way that a mango is peachy. It’s also quite a bit tart, like a plum or grape skin note that sticks out in the middle, and kind of citrusy. This all makes FA Jacote plum a really sweet and sour flavor. It tastes a lot like a mango, with just a little of that funky mango depth, but none of the pine-like flavor. Instead there’s this dark red fruit juicy sugary sweet depth to it underneath, like red plum wine, almost fermented. It’s weird enough that I can easily imagine some people hating, but I love it. I do get a tineey bit of thoat hit with it, but not enough to make me want to avoid it, just enough that it’s something you might want to be aware of. It’s like a typical peach flavor throat hit, on par with something like TFA Nectarine.

ATF currently has only one public recipe that uses it, [Plum Vision](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/253985#plum_vision_by_davidn2kl), and while I’d prefer something tropical with it, I’ll try that. **TASK 12**

Maybe later there will be more recipes, or I’ll create my own.

**Jamaican Rum**

It tastes like dark but unspiced rum. It’s a solid flavor but has one major shortcoming - it’s not very boozy. Trying to turn up the percentage to get more booze doesn’t work because that very dark brown sugar molasses-type taste ramps up faster than the booze does. It’s also a little too sweet. It’s almost like dumping extra dark brown sugar into rum. Also worth noting that while alcohol flavors can get a little throaty, as they should if you’re going for realistic liquor, this one is buttery smooth to me. I love the way it finishes a recipe with rum taste.

Obviously not getting rid of this, I need it for my pina colada and mango colada vapes, and various other things I plan to try.

Also, [Peanut Butter Rum Ballz](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/235966#peanut_butter_rum_ballz_by_cinn) looks simple with just four ingredients but probably tastes exquisite. I’m intrigued by the combination of peanut butter and rum. **TASK 13**

And [Drunken Pudding Remix](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/307979#drunken_pudding_remix_by_jakinbox). There’s a ton of ingredients to dig out, and combining Rum and Bourbon in the same recipe seems like a bit of alcoholic overkill, but this has become a pretty popular recipe in a relatively short amount of time and I wanna see what all the fuss is about. **TASK 14**

**Jasmine**

100% tastes like jasmine, or before someone asks why I’m eating jasmine, tastes the way jasmine smells, but at a good useable concentration, like 1%, it’s a fairly subtle flavor. Unfortunately, trying to push it higher in concentration gets too grassy-tasting and too dry.

I need it to make [Terrorhawk](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/13499#terrorhawk_by_concreteriver), where, contrary to what I just said, it does not come across as overtly grassy or make the recipe too dry. But it does pack some throat hit, so be aware of that.

Can’t wait to try [Flogua](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/158611#flogua_by_lajuanapipa), a recipe that combines FA Jasmine with CAP Sweet Guava, INW Dragonfruit, and INW Cactus. **TASK 15**

**Joy**

Kind of tastes like you spilled Coors light on the floor, waited until the next day, anointed the puddle with just a few drops of vegetable oil, gave it a gentle dusting of powdered sugar, and then tried to lick all of that up. Kind of yeasty, aggressively yeasty but more, more like a stale, cheap beer-ish yeastiness. Sweet, like something lightly covered in powdered sugar. A little oily, but not super forward with the oiliness. And not particularly joyous to vape. There was a time, back in the day, when there were things we just could not get closer to, profile-wise, without using FA Joy. We have better flavors for that now. **TRASH 2**

**Juicy Strawberry**

Not actually juicy. I would even call it a little dry. But it’s a well-rounded flavor with notes that imply both real and candy strawberry, with an earthy touch like a real strawberry, but very sweet and bright like over-saturated candy strawberry, with a strong candy-like tartness to it. It tastes a whole lot like the ancient combination of TFA Strawberry Ripe and CAP Sweet Strawberry, but it’s more than twice as potent as those two, and a little bolder than can be achieved without tasting off with those two. If I wanted something that tastes like TFA Strawberry Ripe and CAP Sweet Strawberry mixed together at like 8% Ripe and 4% CAP Sweet Strawberry, I’d use 3 or 4% Juicy Strawberry instead. Hopefully that would have fewer fading and muting issues as well? Tastes like it might.

Already planning to use it to mix a few people’s recipes. Looking for more, I couldn’t figure out from looking at them which strawberry cheesecake recipe that uses it would be the best, so I’ll try the ones that appear to me to be the top two.

[My Strawberry Cheesecake is Bomb V2](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/206617#my_cheesecake_is_bomb_v2_by_kylezkloudz)
I’m a little worried that it will be over-flavored, but intrigued by the combination of strawberry flavors in it. **TASK 16**

[The Best Strawberry Cheesecake Ever Til Now](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/262469#the_best_strawberry_cheesecake_ever_till_now_by_diyejuices). Mostly for the OoO Strawberry Jam. **TASK 17**

**Kiwi**

Best all-around kiwi, I think. Not perfect. Leans natural but tastes a little oversimplified, like candy. It’s got a nice little tartness upfront with just a little bit of a rindy note, like a kiwi that wasn’t fully peeled. Definitely missing some of the ripe melony depth like the center of the kiwi. Not to mention the absent juiciness. But nothing I would call an off note apart from that bit of rind, and it tastes very clearly like kiwi overall.

Of course I’m not getting rid of FA Kiwi, not while I need it to make [Coop’s Kiwi Bourbon](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/21614#coop_s_kiwi_bourbon_by_id10_t) **TASK 18** and [Green Bastard](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/153649#green_bastard_by_yippyo). **TASK 19**

And the 8 or so recipes I plan to mix so far that use it. I’ll just add one more: [Sunlit Wave](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/305021#sunlit_wave_by_cam9535). That looks like it tastes like a trip to the beach. **TASK 20**

**Labyrinth**

A thick fluffy vanilla cake partially buried in syrupy sweetness and a strange, cooked berry-ish flavor that tastes a little like stewed prunes in a compote with apples and sometime of berry, not really clear what berry, as well as discernible notes of lemon and anise. Very busy with lots going on here. Not disgusting, but I don’t have a clue what to do with it or any desire to do anything with it. **TRASH 3**

**Lavender**

Yep, that tastes like lavender. And that can be very pleasant. But you have to be very careful with the concentration, because just a little too much gets laundry soap very easily.

I need it to make [Galadriel’s Light](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/213994#galadriel_s_light_by_yizarion), fuckin love that stuff. And because I plan to try the original [Jazz Hands](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/54618#jazz_hands_by_kopel) before I run out of Holy Vanilla.

I’ll also take [Peyote](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/183028#peyote_by_selev) out for spin. **TASK 21**

**Lemon Sicily**

This stuff. I know it’s in like, 10,000 recipes, but I don’t even know why you’d ever use this where there are so many better lemons out there. It fades. It doesn’t mix well with bakeries and creams. It’s a little dry and a little harsh - too harsh to ever be the main ingredient in a recipe. But I get it, it does have a nice, mostly realistic slightly sweet lemon flavor that works very well to add some tartness to sweeter, less realistic lemons in all-fruit, short-steep recipes, and although so much of the lemon flavor itself fades over time that it’s silly.

I’m thinking about tossing it, but I already plan to mix [Blog Day](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/51247#blog_day_remixmonth_by_goldfish18).

And if that one doesn’t give me a reason to keep it, one of these might:

[Lemondowskii](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/143749#lemondowskii_by_nickevz) - it’s a vanilla & lemon custard and I’m really interested in how VT Sour Lemon and VT FIzzy Sherbet work in there . **TASK 22**

[Lemon Meringue Pie - the best yet](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/139320#lemon_meringue_pie_the_best_yet_by_nickevz) It’s the WF Flapper Pie + VT Lemon Meringue Tart + VT Pudding Base combo for me. I’ll sub JF Cookie for the FA Cookie. **TASK 23**

Another [Lemon Pie](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/240810#lemon_pie_by_vensyboy) uses both CAP Lemon Meringue Pie and VT Lemon Meringue Tart, along with FA Meringue, but I really want to see what’s up with that 0.5% FA Soho in there. **TASK 24**

**Lime Tahity Cold Pressed**

Unsweetened, straight up lime juice. I think it might actually be made out of lime juice, it’s even a little green-colored. Has a very nice, realistic depth but it is a bit harsh, quickly goes from overpowering to faded out badly. Also serves as a great reminder to shake your concentrates before using them. It visibly separates in the bottle and gets these little floaties in there.

For most things, I think there are better lime options now, but I need it for [Zenitsu](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/197324#zenitsu_by_wolfwheeler).
And it’s in a few recipes that still look good enough that I’ve planned to try them, and now I’ve got a few more:

[Stormy Seas: GingerRumPineLime](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/245358#stormy_seas_gingerrumpinelime_by_rumpirate). How do you not mix a rum drink by RumPirate? **TASK 25**

[Merengado di Albiocca](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/236498#merengado_di_albicocca_by_davidn2kl). Apricot-Lime.. Meringue? Ok, that looks too interesting to ignore. **TASK 26**

[Jack My Papaya](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/224087#jack_my_papaya_oxygen_re_mix_by_kuri_santou). Such an interesting combination, jackfruit, papaya, and lime with vanilla. **TASK 27**

**Lime Tahity Distilled**

Lime zest with a thin soda base. It’s sort of fizzy - doesn’t quite measure up to VT Fizzy Sherbet, has a similar though less pronounced effect. Little bit harsh, thin, and kind of metallic tasting, but I’ve had it work well in several things. Doesn’t fade.

Again, I think it was a good option in the past, but there are better lime flavors now. I made some recipes with it ages ago but those really need to be rebuilt entirely. I would like to try [Xenomorph](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/151253#xenomorph_by_ediblemalfunction) while I’ve still got FA Distilled, though. **TASK 28**

**Liquid Amber**

It tastes like what I imagine it would taste like if you mixed a triple shot of warm brandy with spoonful of sweet-and-sour sauce off the Chinese buffet. You know, the bright red stuff. Once a valuable tool for use in small amounts to make fruits taste cooked or slightly fermented (like turning an apple flavor into something more like apple pie filling or apple cider), this one is needed less now that there are more fruit flavors that already taste cooked.

I need it to mix [Flawed Vacations in Spain](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/137141#flawed_vacations_in_spain_fizzy_sangria_by_motherpunker), love that recipe. **TASK 29**

And I already plan to try this this very intriguing autumnal concoction, [Sunrise Orchards](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/114629#sunrise_orchards_by_chemicalburnvictim). Looking for other reasons to keep it and looking ahead to fall, I’ll also try this [Spiked Apple Bourbon 1-2-3](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/117290#spiked_apple_bourbon_1_2_3_by_nowar) **TASK 30**

And I’m sure it will turn up in some other things I wind up wanting to mix, but that’ll do for now.

**Longan Fresh**

I’m not entirely sure what Longan is supposed to taste like, never tired one, but this is like a bad lychee flavor. Kinda peachy white grapey thing, moderately sweet but just covered with a rosy floral that’s very grandma’s perfume-tasting. **TRASH 4**

**Lulo**

Apparently it’s some sort of South American fruit that’s popular in Columbia and looks like an orange. Anyway FA Lulo pretty much tastes like passionfruit to me. Very tart, fresh, juicy, citrusy, a little funky. It doesn’t taste exactly like passionfruit but I think if you put it in a mix and said it’s there for the passionfruit flavor it would work just fine. And it’s not throat razors like FA Passionfruit, it’s actually pretty smooth for something so acidic tasting.

[IBIZA](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/283572#mwc_ibiza_by_bqrn) is already on the list.

[Isla Bebida Tropical](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/272804#isla_bebida_tropical_by_kuri_santou) will get mixed, too. I’m fascinated by this combination of flavors. **TASK 31**

So will [Frutas Tropicales](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/305242#frutas_tropicales_by_kuri_santou). Same mixer. Guava, papaya, lulo, and bergamot. **TASK 32**

**Lychee**

I’ve had a recipe where 0.25% of this reinforced another lychee and it was fine, but by itself at just slightly higher concentrations this is stupid floral, pushing up on dryer sheets. And also a bit thin and dry. It’s barely recognizable as a lychee in my experience, which admittedly is limited to canned lychee and lychee-flavored candy. Maybe this is what real fresh lychee tastes like? I hope not though. If you told me it was a rose flavor I might believe you. The floral is rough and the base note that should taste like white grapes with maybe hits of grapefruit and pear, tastes more like grape skins without the sweeter, more mellow, juicier body, and there’s a weird chemical off note here, and it’s a little harsh. I’m going to toss it. My lychee needs - yes, I have lychee needs - are better served by other lychee flavors that are tastier and easier to work with. **TRASH 5**

I've not done a great job of getting rid of flavors this week.

New Flavor Count: 2,456
