TASK OR TRASH - Each flavor gets assigned at least one task or it goes in the trash.

## Chefs Super Concentrates

Strap in for a long one, I'm going through all the CSC (or CHF on ATF) flavors. Even though I lost a couple of days working on this to devastating news. I was about 20 flavors into the line when I got word that Chefs is no longer going to be restocking any single flavors. Had to pause to wait for an answer to the question, “Does that include CSC flavors?” I was ready to chuck the whole line at once and replace it with a few choice words for Brexiteers (Chefs troubles being 100% on them, the dumb cunts, yet another completely predictable and avoidable consequence). But it turns out Chefs WILL be restocking their SC line, at least for now. If they don't sell well enough to keep having more made, they'll discontinue those, too, and I'll come back and do a radical flavorectomy of whichever ones I have left, and let Brexiteers know what I really think of them.

**Absinthe**

I've only ever sampled this at 0.5% and it was just too light at that concentration to have much to say about it. I'll try it again at 1.5% **TASK 1**

**Almond (Sweet)**

This one is indeed sweet almond, but also has an off note like lighter fluid. Like you're eating almonds after you got a little lighter fluid on your hands and didn't wash them. I didn't notice it as much after vaping on it for a bit but it comes back with a fresh redrip and seriously folks, just use FA Almond. Also, pretty light at 0.5%. The overall flavor is very light, and it tastes a bit lighter-fluidy? Nope. One or the other, maybe, but not both. **TRASH 1**

**Apple Green**

It is without any doubt a green apple, and it manages to not taste at all like nail polish remover. That's actually automatically above average for a green apple flavor. It lacks the complexity of natural green apple and the intensity of green apple candy though. It's also not very tart or crisp. But I think it might be the best of the more natural green apples I've tried, and it wouldn't be too hard to tart it up and add something to make it a little more natural. For an in your face candy green apple though, I don't think it comes anywhere close to CAP Green Apple Hard Candy or WF Green Jolly Candy.

I'll give this [Chef's Kiss Toffee Apple](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/247410#chef_s_kiss_toffee_apple_by_eyemsam) a try, it seems like just the right use for this flavor. **TASK 2**

**Apple (Toffee Apple)**

I only tried this one at 0.5% and I thought it definitely needed to be used higher than that to get the full effect. You can see in the recipe above, he's using it at 2.5%.

But at 0.5% I thought I more or less got the gist of it: mostly a crisp, juicy green apple and upfront that comes back in the finish a bit, with a middle section, a little band that's like a belt of flavor, that's maybe not exactly toffee, but sweet and toffee-adjacent, like caramel or butterscotch. It's too hard to differentiate between these things when the flavor is that-skimpy.

At the moment there are only two recipes on ATF (and one on ELR) using this, and both are already on my to-mix list. Since it's at 2.5% in both of those, I'll try it standalone at 2.5% and get an even better feel for what it's doing in those two recipes after having tried them. This is how flavor testing works, backward. **TASK 3**

**Banana Candy**

Spot on banana runts, almost full flavored at 0.5%. You know, when WF came out with a Banana Candy, I appreciated how unapologetically candy it was, since so many other banana flavors pretend to be real bananas but seriously taste like banana Runts or Laffy Taffy. Plus they already had WF Banana Puree which doesn't taste like runts. But then Chefs Super Concentrates makes one and now even Flavour Art has one and I'm just not really impressed by this anymore. But it does what it says it's going to do without any off notes and even has that sweet crunchy to powdery candy body. I can't imagine this being in super high demand, but it does a great job of being what it says it is.

Like I said, not really impressed by this anymore. **TRASH 2**

**Biscuit (Buttery)**

Coconut. Light in flavor overall at 0.5%, but what I get is a buttery biscuit that's not as sharp and dry as INW Biscuit or even JF Biscuit, but has a bunch of pretty clear coconut all tangled up with the butter. People who get a coconut off note from INW Biscuit are probably going to taste nothing but coconut from this one. I just tossed CAP Biscuit last week for tasting like this, I don't want a more concentrated version of that. **TRASH 3**

**Biscuit (Speculoos)**

Good news, it doesn't taste coconutty like the Butter Biscuit. So far, I've only tried this at 0.75%. I tasted only getting a light, nondescript bakery with hints of ginger and cinnamon. Telling me something tastes like Speculoos when it really doesn't is a good way to get on my bad side, but I'm reserving judgment on that until I get a chance to try it at a higher concentration. I'll mix a 1.5% sample. **TASK 4**

MIght as well try a couple recipes while I've got it out:

[Lady Gov'ness](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/243869#lady_gov_ness_by_eyemsam). Doesn't that look tasty? **TASK 5**

[Mind Ya Loaf](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/210408#mind_ya_loaf_by_sensory_overload) Might save a flavor or two from the trash. **TASK 6**

**Blackberry**

This is not the worst blackberry I've tried (FA Blackberry - only good for poisoning the water supply of an entire medium-sized city). It's not even the second worst (tie between MB Dark Blackberry and SSA Dark Blackberry (deodorant, grandma's perfume), but it is next in line. Tastes like a mouthful of soap with just a hit of blackberry, it's really terrible, and it's going in the **TRASH 4**

**Blueberry Cheesecake**

I've tried this at 0.75% and 1.25%. At the lower concentration, it is too soft. Like all the flavors are good, but there just aren't enough of them. The blueberry part is the most lacking, there's just a whisper of blueberry. The crust is not lacking as much, it's a very nice grahammy crust. 1.25% is a very cheesy cheesecake, very nice graham crust, and very little blueberry. The cheesecake is actually a bit too far on the cheesy side for me, though I'm sure some will love it. The lack of bold blueberry probably makes it more versatile, you could probably throw any berry on top of that and have a whatever-berry cheesecake. I'm gonna pass on the extra cheesy cheesecake, it's just not for me. **TRASH 5**

**Brown Sugar**

Not a ground brown sugar, but could be an almost game-changing ingredient. The concentration recommended by Chef's seems to be accurate for this one. Mixing this at 0.75% was too much. It wasn't super horrible, but it was way too sharp and had a slight plasticky edge to it. I dumped a bunch out and re-diluted it with base to around 0.4ish percent. Now the only off note is cotton candy, like lots of cotton candy. It tastes like brown sugar cotton candy. Not unpleasant, but not what I'm really looking for in a Brown Sugar Flavor. Spun sugar, cotton candy, candy floss, whatever you want to call it, has a really distinctive taste and this is it, but brown and a little molassesy. Clearly, the ethyl maltol content in this thing is pretty high. That cotton candy dryness does give it something like a sugar texture, though. I don't know that I'd use it for a brown sugar flavor necessarily, but I might try it as a substitute for TFA Ethyl Maltol or Cotton Candy in mix. It seems like it would be absolutely amazing to sweeten the top notes in a custard. What I'm saying is, I might not reach for it when I want brown sugar, but there are lots of times when I might reach for it instead of using Cotton Candy as a sweetener.

I'll try this new [Cosmic Caramel](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/291543#cosmic_caramel_by_azzer) recipe **TASK 7**

**Cactus**

You're hoping for something as juicy as INW Cactus that doesn't actually taste like INW Cactus. This is not it, but it is a unique and interesting take on cactus. Or it would be if FLV hadn't already done it. This tastes remarkably similar to the new-ish FLV Cactus Apple. It has that same sort of soft spongey dried apple slice taste, it tastes a lot more like dried apple slice taste and body, sicky naturally sugary sweetness, very light almost fermented kind of note. Chewy, thick. There's a little hint of that aloe drink flavor I think but really, dried apples. Not the crunchy apple chips, the soft chewy dried apples.I think it's tasty, it's just not what I was expecting or hoping from a cactus. Although it doesn't taste _bad_ to me, I'm not really interested in doing anything with it. I'm not hurting for a FLV Cactus Apple substitute. **TRASH 6**

**Cake (Sponge Cake)**

At 0.75% it doesn't taste “bad” but not a ton of flavor overall and already tastes like it has too much APness. Otherwise pretty sweet, somewhat dry, nonspecific bakery. Doesn't really taste like sponge cake and I don't see it coming together as such at a higher concentration, but I could be wrong.

I have several concerns about this recipe and might change my mind when it comes time to fish out the 11 flavors for it, but for now I'll plan to try [All Day Cake](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/260862#adc_all_day_cake_by_lonesomerhodestn) before I write off CSC's Sponge Cake. **TASK 8**

**Cereals**

Like CAP Cereal 27 without the somewhat honey-ish sweetness that one has, which tastes off to some people. But also lacking the texture of something like Cereal 27. It has a cornflake-ish top note with a smooth bland body and I think a hint of vanilla. It's a little sweet, but it isn't reaching the same sweetness level as most other cereal type flavors. It might be for you, but it's not for me, I'm happy with Cereal 27 and like my cereals crunchier than this regardless. **TRASH 7**

**Cheesecake**

0.5% was way too light, could barely taste anything, kinda tastes like a marshmallow coated in graham cracker dust was waved under my nose, which is a good way to lose a finger, and then whisked away before I could get a bite.

I need to try this again higher, say 1.5%. **TASK 9**

**Chocolate (Milk)**

Well, it's a chocolate that isn't super gross, so it's off to a good start. Not much flavor at 0.5%, but probably enough to add an accent to a recipe. Tastes more like chocolate milk than milk chocolate, specifically chocolate milk made with hershey's chocolate syrup. No real dairy taste here, but it tastes like Hershey's syrup diluted (as if by milk), not as dark and intense as a straight up spoonful of the stuff. Tastes like it might make a good flavor for a sundae topping or build your own banana split. But, I'm really not in need of a Hershey's syrup flavor. **TRASH 8**

**Chocolate (White)**

0.5% is nearly enough concentration, I think, but just a little thin and soft. Not entirely sure if it's the amount, or this is just how it tastes. It's not a great white chocolate. It tastes more like a really bright vanilla with a hint of coconut. Not very rich. It goes down really smooth but isn't quite thick enough to be called creamy. If I wanted to be super duper thorough, I'd try this at a high concentration, but I can already tell this is not the white chocolate I'm looking for. **TRASH 9**

**Coconut Macaroon**

0.75% is again, light, needs to be higher probably, but yes, that absolutely does taste like a coconut macaroon. And it tastes like just one chocolate and a caramel, maybe a little cookie backbone reinforcement, and boom, Samoas.

Nobody has done that yet? Fine, I'm going to try this again at 2% **TASK 10**

And throw together a simple recipe

Samoa V1 **TASK 11**

| Co. | Flavor             | %   |
| --- | ------------------ | --- |
| CSC | Coconut Macaroon   | 1.5 |
| JF  | Cookie             | 1   |
| WF  | Salted Caramel     | 1.5 |
| VT  | Desiccated Coconut | 1   |
| FLV | Chocolate Deutsche | 0.5 |

Not sure if that'll work or not, but it's a start.

**Cookies & Cream**

Tastes like slightly burned Oreos absolutely sogged in milk. Lacks any cookie body at all, just sweet cream with some Oreo chocolate taste that's pretty light in comparison. The Oreo is just a little off, like someone put Oreos in a toaster oven briefly or like they're part of an oreo crust that's been baked. But otherwise sweet and creamy and a little rich. I can see making this work in a recipe but it tastes like it is going to need some work to boost and clean up that oreo and crisp up the cookie texture as well. Pretty similar to FLV Cookies and Cream in the relative lack of Oreo, pretty similar to WF Chocolate Cookie Crust in the light overcooked quality. There are better ways to go about this, if you can track down Real Flavors SC Cookies & Cream, that is _the_ Oreo. This is going in _the_ **TRASH 10**

**Crazy Rainbow**

Fair amount of cooling in this one. I don't know what it is but it feels kinda like FA Polar Blast. More of a cooling on the lips than in the throat like WS-23, but not the kind of vague slightly chemical cardboardly gnarlyness of just straight up Koolada. Otherwise tastes like a mixture of citrus and sweet berry fruit. Chef's calls it lemon with red fruits and a dash of blackcurrant and that's pretty much what it tastes like. Although the lemon is light and the blackcurrant really is just a touch, it mostly tastes like their red fruits mix plus cooling, but those little hints of citrus and kinda funky blackcurrant really kick it up a notch. If this is your profile, you might want to push the concentration up so it really pops and just enjoy it by itself. It's certainly complex enough for that if you like the cooling.

I don't have a clue what to do with this off the top of my head, but instead of a small sample at 0.5% like I had before, I'm going to mix a big bottle at the 1.5% people on ELR tried it at and think about it some more. **TASK 12**

**Cream (Whipped)**

Right off the bat, a touch of weirdly bright vanilla. But that's not far off for something like a Redi Whip kind of whipped cream. And it has a definite dairy taste and kind of a fluffy texture, but also a bit powdery. The dairy is not Redi Whip dairy though, it tastes like real cream but without the full real cream richness, and it also has a little sour tang to it like the cream has gone off a bit. There are better options for whipped cream than this (OoO, FA, SSA, WF, CAP Vanilla...).Too many great Whipped Cream flavors keep this **TRASH 11**

**Creme Anglaise**

Has this same weirdly bright vanilla that some of their creams have on top of a milky dairy and that's about all I get. It's not really unpleasant, it's just a weird vanilla milk, not Creme Anglaise. It's also a little powdery? Like powdered weird vanilla milk that didn't get stirred well enough.

I only tried it at 0.5%. I'm already planning to try [Lady Gov'ness](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/243869#lady_gov_ness_by_eyemsam) that uses it at 1.75% so I'll mix a small sample at the same while I've got it out and see if it's much different than 0.5% and try to see what exactly it's doing in there. **TASK 13**

**Crème Brûlée**

The custard underneath needs help, it's thin to the point of nearly nonexistence. The brûlée part is almost perfect. Sweet crunchy caramelized sugary crust deliciousness. Except, I also get a little spice note in it. It's kinda cinnamony, but not pronounced or clear enough to be definitely cinnamon. Just a warm spice. Leaves me not really knowing what to do with this yummy flavor aside from making a cinnamon, pumpkin spice, or eggnog creme brulee recipe.

Already planning to mix [Cosmic Caramel](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/291543#cosmic_caramel_by_azzer) under Brown Sugar.

I'll also try using it to make that pumpkin spice crème brûlée.

Pumpkin Spice Crème Brûlée V1 **TASK 14**

| Co. | Flavor          | %    |
| --- | --------------- | ---- |
| CSC | Creme Brulee    | 1.5  |
| INW | Custard         | 3    |
| FA  | Custard Premium | 2    |
| CSC | French Vanilla  | 0.5  |
| FLV | Pumpkin Spice   | 0.75 |

**Custard**

There are some great custard flavors out there, this is one of them. It's not one of my absolute favorites, but it's right up there, and there aren't any off notes so it's pretty much a matter of personal preference regarding what one wants in a custard. Sweetness and dairy are its two most prominent characteristics. It's quite sweet, so probably no need to add EM or Cotton Candy or whatever. It's a very milky custard, you really get that dairy. The rest is just enough. It's not buttery, but there's some butter there. It's not at all what I'd call eggy, but it's close enough to be a custard. There's some vanilla, but it's light enough that it's probably good that it doesn't have vanilla in the name. My personal preference is a more prominent vanilla and butter scenario, but that's just me. This is a great custard flavor.

I'll try another version of Pumpkin Spice Crème brûlée using this one.

Pumpkin Spice Crème Brûlée V2 **TASK 15**

| Co. | Flavor          | %    |
| --- | --------------- | ---- |
| CSC | Crème Brûlée    | 1.5  |
| CSC | Custard         | 1.5  |
| INW | Custard         | 2    |
| FA  | Custard Premium | 1    |
| CSC | French Vanilla  | 0.5  |
| FLV | Pumpkin Spice   | 0.75 |

**Custard Cake**

At 0.5%, I get a creamy vanilla bakery. Thin, weak, not really custard, but smooth. I'm interested in trying it at a higher concentration but concerned about the bakery being “burnt” with acetyl pyrazine or another pyrazine, you know, having that freezer-burned quality that too much AP can have right before it crosses over into corn chips. It's not going that way yet at just 0.5%, but tastes like it could.

I'll try it again at 1% **TASK 16**

**Donut**

Full-flavored deep fried cakey donut, not a fluffy yeasty glazed donut. Really tastes and even feels fried, like it has that greasy fried mouthfeel. Touch of something slightly off in the top notes, fruity but can't call it a specific fruit. Tastes like it would be really good and possibly perfect for something like an Apple Cider donut or Pumpkin Spice donut, or just a cake donut with fruit in it like blueberry or strawberry. I don't think you can try to turn this into a plain glazed donut, or at least I don't recommend trying to do that, for that I think you still need WF Glazed Donut and WF Sweet Bread combined. But it's really really good. The closest thing to it is WF Deep Fried Pastry Dough, for that same fried perfection, but that one has spice notes to deal with and this one has vague fruitiness.

No one has tried to use this to make an apple cider donut yet? OK

Apple Cider Donut V1 **TASK 17**

| Co. | Flavor            | %    |
| --- | ----------------- | ---- |
| CSC | Donut             | 0.75 |
| WF  | Fluffy White Cake | 1.5  |
| FLV | Apple Cider       | 1.5  |
| FLV | Apple Filling     | 1    |
| CAP | Cinnamon Sugar    | 1    |

I'm sure that will require significant adjustments, but you gotta start somewhere.

**Dragonfruit (Pitaya)**

This is a weird dragonfruit. It basically tastes like white gummy bears, as dragonfruit flavors tend to do, but there's a funky ripeness to the body and makes it taste like something found in nature. Like you could walk out into the jungle and come back with a basket of ripe fruit from the White Gummy Bear tree. It's a very unique take on Dragonfruit. Not one I was looking for, but probably one that someone is interested in and will find a really cool use for. **TRASH 12**

**Dulce de Leche**

I did not get an accurate DDL out of this, at least not at 0.5%, but it did taste like a nice, sweet, kinda milky caramel type of thing that was not unpleasant in any way. A little light at 0.5% but seems enough to lend some thick caramelly sweetness to a recipe. Curious about what higher concentrations taste like.

I'll try it again, at 1% this time. **TASK 18**

**Exotic Fruits**

First of all this has a better mango taste than their mango. It's riper and more creamy and juicy. But it's also not just mango. There's some grapefruity citrus and red berry in there, and maybe a touch of grape or something grape-ish. It basically tastes like really good mango-forward tropical fruit punch. Does taste like it could stand to be quite a bit bolder, though, it's pretty soft at 0.5%.

I'll try it again, at 1.5% this time. **TASK 19**

**Forest Fruits**

It tastes like your basic “forest fruit” blend of mostly dark but some brighter berry notes. It also tastes both light or under flavored at 0.5% and at the same time having a potpourri like floral note that I did not appreciate and that does not make me want to try it again. **TRASH 13**

**French Vanilla**

Rich, almost buttery “yellow” vanilla. Like if you think of vanilla as being one of three colors, white, yellow, or dark brown, this is that yellow ice cream vanilla, with a little pop of brighter, white vanilla right up front. No complaints, pretty much what I'm looking for in a French Vanilla as long as that little bright pop doesn't get in the way. Full, satisfying flavor at 0.5%.

I don't see any recipes I want to make out of it besides the two I'm already throwing together above, but a very simple French Vanilla Tobacco sounds nice at the moment, let's try that, and I'll push it a little higher, and throw in another CSC flavor for extra funsies.

French Vanilla Tobacco V1 **TASK 20**

| Co. | Flavor              | %    |
| --- | ------------------- | ---- |
| FLV | Red Burley          | 1.75 |
| FLV | Cured Tobacco       | 1    |
| CSC | French Vanilla      | 0.75 |
| CSC | Toasted Tobacco Pop | 0.75 |

**Grape**

It basically just tastes purple, as grape flavors do. There's a touch of astringency to it that seems like a nod to realistic grapes, but it's such a light touch that I'd probably be happier without it. Just gimme that grape jolly rancher, I guess. Tastes a little light at 0.5%, but seems like it could go medicine-ish if pushed too high. It's certainly not a bad one, but I just don't have a need for yet another “purple” flavor. **TRASH 14**

**Grapefruit Pink**

0.5% is too low, I really need to try it again. Nothing else wrong with it, but it's really soft and doesn't pack a punch of flavor at 0.5%. Will try 1% **TASK 21**

**Guava**

Excellent Guava. If Flavorah Pink Guava and CAP Sweet Guava are opposite ends of the guava spectrum, this is right in the middle. It has those high tart citrus notes like FLV but doesn't wind up tasting like pink grapefruit, it also has that thick syrupy kinda funky sweet base like CAP. There's a slight floral edge but thankfully no cat pee taste like with TFA guava or musky perfume like FA and VT guavas. I think this might be the most authentic guava I've tried and it's very well-rounded with flavor from top to bottom.

I couldn't find a recipe for this. But I'm going to mix this recipe, [Jack My Guanabana Guava](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/233596#jack_my_guanabana_guava_by_kuri_santou) **TASK 22**

And then make another bottle exactly the same but with the addition of 0.75% CSC Guava, a hair less Cactus, say, 0.5% instead of 0.75%, and, just for fun, 1% FLV Yakima Hops, and compare them. **TASK 23**

**Hazelnut Cream**

This one has a little chocolate accent to it. It shouldn't be there, but it's like the chocolate in VT Macadamia Nut and Devon Cream, it's not necessarily a bad thing, just odd. It's full enough at 0.5% and it tastes like hazelnut flavored coffee creamer without the coffee, but with a little cocoa instead. Almost like someone made a Nutella-flavored coffee creamer, but not quite that much chocolate. It's rich, sweet, and creamy.

At the beginning of Part 9, I went over how even though this [Bavarian Banana Nut Bread](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/255112#bavarian_banana_nut_bread_by_gunslinger317) was awesome, I wasn't going to be keeping CAP Bavarian Cream just to be able to make it, because there's more than one way to skin that cat. Here we go. I'll show you. This ain't rocket surgery. I'm just going to make that recipe again, but substitute 0.5% CSC Hazelnut Cream for the CAP Bavarian Cream. Guaranteed deliciousness. If that chocolate shows up under all that, and I kinda hope it does, I might come back later and bring in some more chocolate because chocolate chips or chocolate frosting plus banana nut bread sounds like a winner to me. **TASK 24**

**Honey**

It's not a very strong off note, so in a mix with a strong top note I bet it could be covered up, but as a single flavor, I get just the slightest tish of the dreaded cat pee honey off note in CSC Honey, right on top, where the flavor is brightest. It's a shame because it otherwise has a nice dark sticky sweetness (though it would really need to be even sweeter for honey) like a darker honey that's not at all floral or perfumy. I'm not fighting with this one. **TRASH 15**

**Lemon**

At 0.75%, I can taste lemon but can't even tell you whether it's more of a natural lemon or candy lemon this low, it's too soft. But I also can't taste anything wrong with it, either. It's lemony enough to be slightly refreshing though, like a glass of water with a lemon wedge.

Will try again at 1.5% **TASK 25**

**Lemon Custard**

As best I can remember (since I haven't had it out in awhile), it tastes like they've tried to clone FA Custard and failed successfully. It's pretty similar to FA Custard, but a little more lemony, a little richer, a little better. CSC Lemon Custard is a nicely lemony, milky, thin for a custard but still pretty thick, not bad flavor at all.

222 LMP V1 **TASK 26**

| Co. | Flavor        | %   |
| --- | ------------- | --- |
| CSC | Lemon Custard | 2   |
| WF  | Lemon Squares | 2   |
| WF  | Flapper Pie   | 2   |

**Lemon Meringue Pie**

Too light at 0.5%, like way too light, but does still taste like a bit of lemon with some really nice toasted meringue piled on top. The meringue note is promising, but it tastes like the lemon needs help. Also, no custardy richness or any crust at all. I'll try it again at 2%. **TASK 27**

**Lime**

La Croix Lime at 0.5%. Kinda sweet though, tastes like a higher percentage might give me more of a limeade-type of flavor. Will try again at 2% **TASK 28**

**Lychee**

The best natural Lychee I have ever tried so far. That rose-like floral that's supposed to be there with Lychee is present but nicey subdued, not like those other lychees that exaggerate it to the point of perfumyness. A little tart. The base is more like slightly funky tropical white grape that's really sweet, but still tastes natural, like real canned lychee in syrup. It's a tie for me between this one and FE Lychee, which is very much a lychee hard candy and not something found in nature.

Nobody has made anything out of this yet? Alright, well, I'm still stuck on the FLV Guanabana thanks to seeing that Jack My Guanabana Guava recipe. How about...

Lych My Guanabana, Jack V1 **TASK 29**

| --- | --------- | --- |
| CSC | Lychee    | 0.5 |
| FLV | Guanabana | 3   |
| TFA | Jackfruit | 2   |

Just messing around with some fun tropicals, as one does.

**Macaroon**

First of all they've misspelled it. There's only supposed to be one O in Macaron, so that's annoying. Also, at 0.75%, it's like if La Croix came in French Macron flavor. That's the right flavor, but there's just so little of it, it's like a shadow of the right flavor. I get that macrons have a delicate flavor, but not this freakin delicate. I'll try it again at 1.5% **TASK 30**

**Madeline**

Not much flavor at 0.5% but what's there is a pleasant enough little soft, sweet cookie with a fluffy and light but buttery body. I could see this being well above average if a little higher concentration doesn't bring out any off notes. It might have too much AP sharpness, though, I can kinda taste it in there and have some concern about it being too much at a higher concentration.

I'll try it again at 1% **TASK 31**

**Man Pi**

Potentially unappetizing name there. But tastes really good. It's like a tropical fruit punch. Chefs mentions raspberry and other red fruits with a touch of lychee and citrus. Not really finding the citrus but it basically tastes like their Red Fruits and their Lychee mixed together into a fairly balanced lychee-red fruit mix that's really interesting and different.

I have an idea.

| CAP | Super Sweet      | 0.25 |

**Mango**

I've tried enough really awful to sup-par mango flavors to say this one is above average even though there's not much flavor at 0.5%. There's enough to get a decent mango taste out of it. It's got a gentle pineyiness and a sweet kinda funky peachy depth and seems like it would more than do to add a mango accent to a couple of other fruits, at least. I'll try it again at 1%. **TASK 33**

**Maple Syrup**

I only got the barest of flavor from this at 0.5%. What I got didn't taste like maple syrup, just a little dark sweetness. Will try again at 1.5% **TASK 34**

**Marshmallow**

Definitely marshmallow. Fairly bright. Sweet, somewhat powdery, thick pillowy body. Seems like it might pick up an anise note if pushed too high in concentration though it's not really there at 0.75%, but I've tried a lot of marshmallows and that is a thing that too much marshmallow flavor tends to do. The problem is, a high bar has been set for marshmallow flavors by the likes of FLV Marshmallow Vanilla and especially OoO Marshmallow Vanilla. But I do like this one better than FA Marshmallow, which is drier than Chef's Super Marshmallow and not as sweet, but otherwise pretty similar. If this flavor's future availability was more secure, I'd keep this one and toss FA Marshmallow. But since it isn't, and since I have other, even better marshmallows, I'm going to **TRASH 16** a perfectly good flavor.

**Meringue**

Nice and toasty, kinda dry, crisp meringue which is good, nothing wrong with that if that's what you're looking for, but light in flavor at 0.5% and I worry about that toastyness getting a little too nutty if cranked up. I have FA Meringue, TFA Meringue, and the best meringue flavor out there, WF Flapper Pie. I don't need another meringue. **TRASH 17**

**Milk (Fresh)**

Above average for being called milk and not being gross. Some of those milk flavors are pretty freakin gross. And, it actually tastes like milk. But, it's missing that lovely mouth-coating dairy milkfat mouthfeel and is even a little dry, so also more like powdered milk. Could make it work, I'm sure, but I don't know why you would do that when you could use FA Milk or OoO Cream Milky Undertones. **TRASH 18**

**Milkshake Strawberry**

First of all, that is not a milkshake. It doesn't have anywhere near the full richness of a milkshake. But it does taste like strawberry milk. Not Nesquick, don't get too excited, but some strawberry milk made out of some obscure brand of strawberry syrup that doesn't have anything wrong with it, but doesn't tickle the Nesquick nostalgia bone. But anyway, it's as probably as good as any strawberry milk or strawberry and cream flavor I've had, those tend to be generally disappointing. I don't need a strawberry milk flavor, I've got strawberry flavors and milk flavors and I can shake a bottle of juice with the best of em. **TRASH 19**

**Mint (Fresh)**

Really nice, very average peppermint. Not extra chilly like FLV Peppermint or INW Shisha Peppermint. Just a little more cooling than a natural peppermint leaf. More candy cane than Altoids, but not as sweet as candy cane. The thing is, I like those extra icy ones a lot, and if I need one that's not quite so icy, I've got a couple of those that are more accessible, too. **TRASH 20**

**Mint (Green)**

Wrigley's spearmint chewing gum. Nothing special, nothing wrong with it either, but not a type of flavor I'm really interested in. **TRASH 21**

**Mint (Organic)**

Mild spearmint that tastes natural, not chewing gum like Mint Green. I still prefer the Sobucky Super Aroma one, Garden Mint, because it's even more green and herbal, really leafy, but this is right up there. How many mild natural spearmints does one need? I'm thinking the number is probably less than however many I have. I'm choosing SSA Garden Mint over this one. **TRASH 22**

**Mint Cream**

Excellent. Exactly as advertised. I was scared it was going to be like toothpaste but it is not that at all. The mint is like an artificial spearmint flavor, the cream is thick and sweet with some vanilla. I wish I could just spread this single flavor sample onto a dark chocolate brownie and eat it. It reminds me of FLV Spearmint and LB Vanilla Mint, but better. It has a less intense mint and less intense vanilla than the LB, which is like smearing vanilla frosting on one of those green mint leaf gummy/jelly candies. It doesn't have the separation I get from FLV Spearmint, which is like a mint and cream separate at the same time while this CSC Mint Cream is more blended together into one cohesive thing.

You know those mint and dark chocolate Kit Kats? Let's give that a try.

Mint/Dark Duo V1 **TASK 35**

| Co. | Flavor              | %   |
| --- | ------------------- | --- |
| WF  | Crispy Wafer        | 1   |
| CSC | Mint Cream          | 1   |
| SSA | Milky Caramel Fudge | 1   |
| MF  | Dark Chocolate      | 0.7 |
| CAP | Super Sweet         | 0.3 |

4% total flavor, but those are potent flavors, I think this will get er done.

**Mint Lemon**

0.5% is too low. I got mint and lemon and nothing off but it's just so, so light. I'll try again at 1.5% **TASK 36**

**Mojito**

At 0.75%, I did not get any booze or even more than a hint of citrus, but it really does taste like a nice fresh mint mulled with sugar and there's a hint of citrus, so i'm thinking maybe it comes together at a higher concentration and even if it doesn't, it seems like a good start to a Mojito vape. Will try again at 1.5% **TASK 37**

**Natural Citrus**

0.5% Tasted vaguely citrusy, but I couldn't name the specific fruits beyond saying it's got orange but it's not just orange. Another one to try again at 1.5% **TASK 38**

**Oat**

Seems usable. And for the most part it does taste like oatmeal or like breathing in from a carton of dry oats. But, it also has something odd up front, like a nutty floral, and it's distracting to me. I think I'll probably stick with the SSA Classic Oat flakes for my authentic oat needs, but I can't trash it yet because this [Sherlock Oats](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/256539#sherlock_oats_by_duncanyoyo1) recipe looks way too interesting to pass on trying. **TASK 39**

**Peach Apricot**

Points off because it's not really an authentic apricot, but points back on for being yummy. I don't really get peach and apricot clearly and separately, more like peach and something that is maybe apricot blended together. Very sweet and has almost a richness to it, at least “richness” for a fruit. It's a little peach rings candy-ish, but also has elements of more like a natural fruit, it's a saturated flavor, reasonably full bodied at 0.5% and tastes like it might be even more so if pushed up to 0.75%. I could see it working really well at 0.5% or lower in something like a fruit punch situation where peach is an element, or filling out a peach ring candy recipe.

I need it for the Lady Gov'ness recipe noted above. That recipe uses uses it at 1.25%, and since I've only tried it at 0.5% so far, I'll do a single flavor sample at 1.25%. **TASK 40**

**Peanut Butter**

Peanut butter is one of the few CSC that tastes to me like 0.75% might have been too much. There certainly is a dry roasted peanut flavor in there and it is sweet like PB, but that good stuff wrapped up in this blanket of weird astringent chemical note that is pretty gnarly. It's not the classic “nut skin” kind of off note that I'm used to encountering with nut flavors either, it's worse, more chemical-tasting than that. Like peanut butter made from peanuts grown next to an oil refinery and poisoned with benzene or something equally cancerous. It's not good. But maybe 0.5% is better? I'll try that. **TASK 41**

**Pecan Nut**

This one tastes like it might be too much at 0.5%!! I get the pecan, but there's also this underlying vaguely rotten grossness that it can't quite shake off. I get that same rotten nut note from FW 555 tobacco. It grosses me right out, even though there's just a little of it. But I'll give it another shot, this time at 0.25%. **TASK 42**

**Pistachio**

There are two types of pistachio, authentic nut flavor and that fake green pistachio ice cream flavor. This one isn't exactly either of those, but it's more like the fake green pistachio ice cream flavor than actual nut. It's even got a rich, creamy feel to it. But it tastes off, not in a gross way, but a little like marzipan. Yeah, that's it, it tastes like 50/50 pistachio ice cream and marzipan. Which, while not at all gross, I don't know what to do with that. **TRASH 23**

**Plum**

This is the best plum I've tried. Legit tastes like a plum. Nice spectrum of flavor on this one. It's bright and a bit peachy up front, but has a deep darker depth and a little juicy-to-syrupy sweet finish. Lingering plum aftertaste. Other than it tasting a little too much like a peach in the top notes, I'm not finding anything to complain about here. Tastes like it would work perfectly well in any recipe for plum or in a fruit mix where a stone fruit base needs to be filled in. I might want to lean into the peachiness and rather than trying to cover it up and instead use a little CSC plum to “ripen” and sweeten a strong peach flavor.

Didn't see a recipe with it, but that's ok. I'll have a little fun

Plumber V1 **TASK 43**

| Co. | Flavor         | %    |
| --- | -------------- | ---- |
| CSC | Plum           | 0.75 |
| FA  | Vanilla Tahity | 3    |

That's it. That's the whole thing. I don't have a full profile idea yet, I just think these two flavors would taste really good together.

**Popcorn**

0.5% doesn't taste like much of anything, lots of bland puffy volume with a slight corny taste. But that's popcorn without butter or salt. And I'm not getting that butyric note that can be hard to cover up in FLV Popcorn, though it's also not quite as on-point for a plain popcorn as that. Very similar at 0.5% to 5% of TFA Kettle Corn. Not as sweet as TFA Kettle Corn but like it, has a kind of buttery feel without any detectable butter taste.

I could take it or leave it, but I'm already planning on mixing a recipe that uses it. Might as well make it two recipes, this [cronchy cereal](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/284899#cronchy_cereal_mwc_by_vapenxx) looks interesting **TASK 44**

I'm up against reddit's character limit but Part 11, which is just the rest of Part 10, will be up in a few minutes.
