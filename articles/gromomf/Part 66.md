#CAPELLA Licorice

Update. I gave CAP Licorice five chances to convince me I needed to keep restocking it. All five recipes were good. One of them stood out as something I definitely want more of: [Black Drums of War](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/209901-black_drums_of_war). Does exactly what it says it’s going to do, and peppermint is such a fantastically refreshing addition to the licorice. **TASK 1**

Two others that were both great, but rather than make them again, I’m going to try combining them. [Licorice Berry Much!](https://www.alltheflavors.com/recipe/159538-licorice_berry_much) is an awesome black licorice/berry combo and I especially enjoy the additions of CAP Jelly Candy and OoO Powdered Sugar candying it up so nicely. [Shoggoth](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/252690-shoggoth) is similar but much simpler, the same two licorice flavors found in Licorice Berry Much, plus two berry flavors - CAP Sweet Currant and WF Mora (Blackberry), and wow those berries. Especially the CAP Sweet Currant. But, I do wish it was a little stronger, licorice-wise. It’s tilted toward berries and I think it would be neat if it were more balanced. So, I’m going to try to merge them and see what happens:

Shoggoth Berry Much v1 **TASK 2**

| Co. | Flavor            | %    |
| --- | ----------------- | ---- |
| CAP | Licorice          | 2    |
| FA  | Black Touch       | 2    |
| CAP | Sweet Currant     | 2.5  |
| WF  | Mora (Blackberry) | 1.5  |
| CAP | Jelly Candy       | 1    |
| CAP | Super Sweet       | 0.25 |
| OoO | Powdered Sugar    | 0.75 |

That’s the 2% CAP Licorice from Shoggoth rather than the 1.5% in Licorice Berry Much and the 2% FA Black Touch from Licorice Berry Much rather than the 1% in Shoggoth. The berry combo is straight from Shoggoth and the add-ons are straight from Licorice Berry Much. Bet that’s gonna be amazeballs.

#MAGICAL FLAVOUR

These flavors aren’t even in the ATF database, and based on the ones I’ve tried, there is a good reason for that. Lots of them are going in the garbage.

**Aloe 6001**

Definitely tastes like an aloe juice drink, but with a really sweet, candied finish. Unfortunately, also noticeably dry and a little harsh. Makes me wonder if aloe juice drink comes in a powder I can mix with sugar and eat like Pixie Sticks. Anyway, if you’re looking for an extra sweet aloe drink flavor and don’t have a baby throat, it might be with tracking down and checking out, but it’s not for me. **TRASH 1**

**Apricot 6001**

Green Apple. This does not taste like an apricot flavor. It tastes like a slightly below average green apple flavor with a touch of peach and a touch of nail polish remover, like some of the other below average green apple flavors have. But only a touch of it, it’s not the most offensive of the green apples and kinda reminds me of INW Anton Apple, if it weren’t for that touch of peach in the middle. Anyway, it’s not a good apricot, but it is kind of interesting. You could combine it with a good candy peach with a good green apple candy for a kind of “two jolly ranchers at once” recipe. You could. I’m not going to be doing that. **TRASH 2**

**Apricot 6001 Plus**

I don’t know what the “plus” means but I’ll mix a 1% sample (these are potent flavors) and try to find out. **TASK 3**

**Australian Mango**

Haven’t tried this one. Will do a 1.5% sample. **TASK 4**

**Baked Potato**

Haven’t this one. Will reluctantly mix a 1.5% sample. **TASK 5**

**Banana 6001**

Smooth, sweet, subdued artificial/candy banana, with a thick syrupy body and an odd woody off-note. Maybe it’s just the tropical connection, but that weird woody thing makes me think of coconut husks. Like you’re making a homemade banana candy of some sort, maybe a gummy candy, and accidentally got a bunch of coconut pubes in there from the coconut you shaved earlier for whatever reason. It’s not a strong woody off note, but it lingers in the aftertaste and there are better bananas to choose from. **TRASH 3**

**Blackcurrant 6002**

Have not tried. Will do 1%. **TASK 6**

**Condensed Milk 6001**

Will try 1%. Can’t be any worse than FA Condensed Milk, right? **TASK 7**

**Cranberry 6001**

Not sure how I missed this one when I tried a slew of cranberry flavors. Will mix a 1% sample. **TASK 8**

**Cubilose**

Bird’s nest flavor? WTF? 1.5% sample. **TASK 9**

**Energy Cow 3001**

Tempted to toss it just for the Red Bullish name that’s less clever than FW’s Red Bowl. Will do 1.5% sample. **TASK 10**

**Fruit Sweetener**

Have not tried, will do a 0.5% sample to see what’s up with this. **TASK 11**

**Grape 1701**

Tastes like a slightly medicinal really cheap gross white wino wine, really sweet but boozy and fermented. If I wanted something of this profile, I’d go with FA White Wine or the more accessible FLV Moscato. It’s just a crappy medicine-tasting version of those. **TRASH 4**

**Grape 6001**

I’ve tried a bunch of Magical Flavour’s grapes, but not this one. Will do a 1.5% sample. **TASK 12**

**Grape 6001 Plus**

Tastes like you’ve decided to paint your nails while chewing grape gum that you’ve already chewed a good chunk of the flavor out of. Soft but sweet and full-bodied grape gum flavor with a slight nail polish off note - not that acetone nail polish remover off note that’s common with like green apple flavors, I mean actual nail polish. It’s not tasty. **TRASH 5**

**Grape 6002 Plus**

It’s ruined by the same nail polish off note as the 6001 Plus, maybe the plus stands for plus nail polish? But the grape flavor itself is bolder, darker, and very purple. It also has an almost buttery richness and creamy feel to it, which is weird, but not exactly gross. If a lower concentration than 2% or a longer steep gets rid of the nail polish, I could see this working very well in a grape jam type of situation. It’s not really jammy by itself, but a jam-type situation where the odd buttery richness wouldn’t be out of place seems like a potential use for it. **TRASH 6**

**Grape 6003**

No off notes at 2%, not a lot of flavor either, just tastes like watered down 6001 Plus without the nail polish, soft grape gum with a bunch of the flavor already chewed out. **TRASH 7**

**Grape 6004**

As the number goes up, the Magical Flavors grapes keep getting better, apparently. This one is a purple candy grape flavor that's still a little soft, but more assertive than many of the others, more than FE Grape, and has a nice jolly rancher tartness to it. No off notes, this is a really good purple flavor. Not bad at all, but I have CNV Grape and FLV Grape and am not in need of purple candy grape flavor that’s not as good as either of those. **TRASH 8**

**Green Apple**

Very sweet syrupy green apple jolly rancher flavor, like vaping a melted jolly rancher, but with a moderate acetone/nail polish remover off note, and pretty harsh as well. It’s probably not terrible a little lower than 2%, especially if you don’t have a baby throat, but nothing special either. **TRASH 9**

**Green Mango 901**

Have not tried. Hopefully it tastes more like VT Green Mango than either of the Health Cabin green mango flavors I’ve tried. 1% sample. **TASK 13**

**Hami Melon**

I don’t even know what to expect but I’ll give it a try and report back. 1.5% sample. **TASK 14**

**Hami Melon 6001 Plus**

Same as regular Hami Melon, will try at the same concentration as Hami Melon and really try to figure out what the “plus” is all about. **TASK 15**

**Honey 6001**

It’s a brighter honey with a very slight cat pee at 0.25%, but it’s also a very light flavor down that low. Seems perfectly fine for a light, bright honey accent this low, also seems like the cat pee would ramp up as well if I tried a higher % for more flavor. It has some sweetness to it, but not as sweet as honey. It’s interesting to me that it’s brighter yet not at all floral, but in the end there are honeys that are more flavorful and less off-notey and probably a better choice. **TRASH 10**

**Icey Red Bean**

I’m scared because of FA Red Bean but will push down that fear and mix a 0.25% sample. **TASK 16**

**Lemon 2001 Plus**

Didn’t have this one the last time I tried comparing a ton of lemon flavors. Will do a 1% sample. **TASK 17**

**Malaysia Grape Mix**

Weird, funky, overripe grape that tastes a little more like blackcurrant than grape. Really sweet, strangely warm upfront, sticky, like a lollipop that’s already been sucked on a bit, but also has a little cooling in it. The juxtaposition of the weird warmth and light cooling is strange to me and comes across a bit medicine-like. I know some people out there will love this, but I’m definitely not one of them. It’s just too weird for me. **TRASH 11**

**Malaysia Mango**

Funky ripe mango-scented hairspray. It’s an abomination. **TRASH 12**

**Mango 6001**

Haven’t tried. 1.5% sample. **TASK 18**

**Mango 801**

Ditto. **TASK 19**

**Mango 901**

Ditto. **TASK 20**

**Mango 901 Plus**

At 2%, there’s a nice funky sweet ripe mango underneath some gnarly mop water off-notes (combination of dirt and floor cleaner). It’s probably better at a lower concentration but I don’t think testing that out is the best use of my time. **TRASH 13**

**Mung Bean 4001**

Scary. Will start with a 0.25% sample on this one. **TASK 21**

**Papaya 6001**

At 1%, the flavor goes quickly from a very tart and slightly floral pineapple-like tart note to a very deep somewhat cheesy ripe funkiness, without pausing long enough for the fruity midsection to shine through. It’s there, and it tastes like papaya, but the tartness and ripeness are exaggerated so much that it takes a back seat. Seems like a smaller amount might work as a kind of additive to make a flat or candy like papaya or even another tropical fruit seem more realistic with the tartness on one end and the ripeness on the other, but I wouldn’t try using it as a single flavor papaya. Might also be worth noting that it makes my mouth feel like I just ate fresh pineapple, even though it isn’t really harsh to vape. **TRASH 14**

**Pear**

Not a terrible candy-type pear flavor. It’s pretty obviously artificial and doesn’t taste exactly like pear, but does taste more like pear candy than any other fruit candy. Pear-ish. It’s very sweet and has an interesting powdered sugar-like taste attached to the sweetness. Like if I wanted to try to recreate this using other flavors, I might try mixing OoO Powdered Sugar with another candy-ish pear and I might get pretty close to Magical Flavour Pear. Since I have plenty of other pears to play with, **TRASH 15**

**Pomelo Tea**

Another one that’s not a terrible flavor, but the tea runs a little floral and the citrus is subdued. It’s tea-forward. If you want a black tea that runs a little floral and you don’t have FLV Black Tea, and you don’t mind a soft grapefruity/lemony citrus that’s slightly cleaning product-ish but not super Pledge-y coming along with it, go for it. But, you could probably just take FLV Black Tea and add your favorite lemon and grapefruit flavors to it for the same effect. **TRASH 16**

**Red Bean 6001 Plus**

Terrifying, but that’s more Flavour Art’s fault than Magic Flavours’ fault. Will try 0.25%. **TASK 22**

**Root Beer Soda**

Haven’t opened, will try 1% sample. **TASK 23**

**Super Cooling Agent 3001**

Haven’t opened, will try 1% sample, this better not just be Koolada or I’ll be pissed. **TASK 24**

**Sweet Corn 7001**

A little scary, but that’s more Health Cabin’s fault than Magic Flavours’ fault. Will try 0.25%. **TASK 25**

**Watermelon Plus**

I think the reason I haven’t opened this is that I was on vacation during the last Noted Watermelon episode. Will mix a 0.75% sample. **TASK 26**

New Flavor Count: 2,165
