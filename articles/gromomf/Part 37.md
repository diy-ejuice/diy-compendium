TASK OR TRASH - Each flavor gets assigned at least one task or it goes in the trash.

## FLAVORAH

**Tangerine**

Lemony tangerine that tastes a lot like Tang, but not quite as much like Tang as VT Orange Tang. Rather than going full Tang with with the artificiality, there’s some depth and earthiness in the bottom notes and some more natural tangy lemon juice notes up higher. I enjoy the flavor, but the overall effect is kind of odd, like orange powder drink mix with added natural tangerine and lemon juices, and that’s just a strange thing to do. Typical citrus TH. Not a bad flavor, but there’s nothing I want to make with it, so it can go. **TRASH 1**

**Tatanka Tobacco**

If you like chewing tobacco, this is the flavor for you. I don’t mind a little of it in a mix, but if you use too much, I think around 1.5%, it really really tastes like Red Man, which is something I can’t deal with because of how sick I got the first time I tried that.

It’s used in a few recipes I already plan to try at 0.75%, 1%, 1.25%, and one I really feel like I’m taking a risk on at 1.5%.

I also need it for [Black Forest Bacco](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/87014#black_forest_bacco_by_shyndo), a tobacco with cherry and chocolate accents. **TASK 1**

And want to try this [Chocomint Bacco](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/217671#chocomint_bacco_by_tesladelmar) that had me at FLV Creme de Menthe. **TASK 2**

**Tequila Agave**

It does not really bring the booze, but it definitely tastes like tequila otherwise, besides being a little too sweet. So kinda like a very well done tequila candy, sweetened with agave syrup rather and sugar. I wish it did have that warm boozy top note that made it seem truly alcoholic, but I don’t know of a better tequila flavor. I also get a very slight orange-ish citrus off-note from it, but since the main uses for a tequila flavor are going to involve citrus anyway, I’m not mad about that.

I need to make more [Grapefruit Rose Paloma](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/148248#grapefruit_rose_paloma_by_tamvapes) (already a recently added task), which I love, and am really looking forward comparing it to this [Sierra Bonita](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/216920#sierra_bonita_paloma_del_sol_by_spdrjrslm) paloma (also recently added).

[Bloody Ginger Reeta](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/148303#bloody_ginger_reeta_by_nerf) was an excellent recipe, but not one I feel I just have to make again. What I do want very much is a mango margarita and, seeing none, I guess I’ll have to try to make my own.

1-2-3 Mango Marg V1 **TASK 3**

| Co. | Flavor        | %   |
| --- | ------------- | --- |
| FLV | Tequila Agave | 1   |
| FLV | Ripe Mango    | 2   |
| VT  | Persian Lime  | 3   |

This is just a starting place, I assume it will need a bunch of work to balance and will not end up being a 1-2-3 or even having just three ingredients. I just want to see if these three flavors are going to work and go from there.

**Thai Chai**

I like this flavor that tastes just like the one of the versions of Thai tea at the only Thai place in my town. I think it’s delicious, but it’s really “busy” with a lot going on and that might put some limits on how it could be used. FLV Thai Chai is primarily a tea flavor. There’s a lot of perfectly astringent black tea flavor right in the middle here, along with some honey-like sweetness. The base has a touch of rich, creamy, vanilla, but it’s not so rich and thick that it’s not refreshing and mouthwatering. Top notes are a light but balanced amount of cinnamon and cardamom, maybe someone will pick out another spice or two but those are the only two I taste. The cardamom here is a little basil-ish or almost minty but still quite accurate. It’s a very full-bodied and well-rounded, deep, complex flavor.

I might wind up using it in one of my projects, a papaya chai tea. The current plan is to start with VSO Chai Tea, WF Papaya, and WF Vanilla Cream Extra. But if I can get FLV Thai Chai to work, I might be able to get it down to two flavors. I’ll try that.

The Ashton V2, **TASK 4**

| Co. | Flavor    | %   |
| --- | --------- | --- |
| FLV | Thai Chai | 1.5 |
| TFA | Papaya    | 1   |

**Toffee**

It’s got issues. It kind of tastes like toffee, you get the sweet caramelized sugar and butter, but It tastes really dark, like molasses dark, complete with that acrid edge you get with molasses that’s a little burnt tasting, as well as some fruity sourness in the middle that toffee probably shouldn’t have, a little dry, a little harsh. It is sweet and full, and it does have more of a sugary feel to it. That dark molasses toffee is a legit type of toffee so if that’s the type of toffee you want, this should do it, but it still probably shouldn’t have that odd fruity sour aspect.

The only reason I’m definitely keeping this is [Pheasant Ridge](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/64553#pheasant_ridge_by_fear), so I wonder if I couldn’t get rid of it by replacing the FLV Toffee in that recipe with VT English Toffee. I doubt it will work, there’s some magic going on in there that might be thrown off, but it’s worth a shot. **TASK 5**

But, there are a few other recipes I want to try that use it as well:

[Pecan Toffee Cool Whip](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/126354#pecan_toffee_cool_whip_by_cygnusy1), pecan, toffee, and light cream, looks delightful. **TASK 6**

[Graham Toff Tarkin](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/190494#graham_toff_tarkin_by_eyemsam) is a graham cracker cereal and milk recipe that I really hope will be worth pulling out all those ingredients. **TASK 7**

[1-2-3 Banoffee](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/136700#1_2_3_banoffee_by_ruderudi). Always on the lookout for a good simple recipe, this one is just banana, toffee, and a little whipped cream. **TASK 8**

And [Get Toff My Cookie](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/181521#get_toff_my_cookie_by_mlnikon), a buttery cookie with toffee bits that looks ridiculous good thanks to WF Cookie Butter, VT Honeycomb, and just 1% of FA Soho in there. I’ll sub JF Cookie for the FA Cookie. **TASK 9**

**Tricks Cereal**

Trix cereal with mushrooms. It mostly tastes like Trix in that it has the right fruit flavor down, but without the Trix crunchy grains, and what it has instead of crunch is mushroom. Not a lot of it, just hint, but it’s that same weird mushroom flavor I get from FLV Crunch Cereal, and it’s nasty. I get it at 1% and get a less offensive amount of it at 0.75%. Down at 0.25 and 0.5%, it did not pick up the mushroom flavor, just a kind of sweet fake lemon-grape-raspberry flavor of Trix... but it’s also a very weak flavor down that low. I guess it’s possible to use this somewhere between 0.5 and 0.75% and get enough of the right Trix fruity top note, then add another cereal flavor such as CAP Cereal 27 to fill in the base, but I don’t want to bother with it. **TRASH 2**

**Tropical Citrus**

Sweet tangerine- & somewhat lemon-forward citrus mix with a touch of a orange peel, not really sure what makes it “tropical.” It almost tastes like someone tried to piece together a tangerine out of orange, blood orange, and lemonade flavors and mostly succeeded, with some lemonade and a little orange peel peeking out. It’s a pretty smooth vape for a citrus, though. Finding nothing to do with it, **TRASH 3**

**Tropical Punch**

Riddled with off-notes. Dunk a piece of dried out, already chewed watermelon bubblegum in Hawaiian punch, shove some watermelon rind up one nostril and an orchid up the other, then suck on that gum. Viola! FLV Tropical Punch. It has a strong watermelon bubblegum flavor and it’s a touch floral. Nice but softer than it should be Hawaiian punch top note, and top heavy, but then quite a bit dry, not juicy or syrupy sweet, and the base tastes like sucking on a piece of ABC watermelon gum, with a bit of watermelon rind a flower shoved up your nose. **TRASH 4**

**Turkish Tobacco**

<3

I feel FLV Turkish is everything I want in a Turkish tobacco flavor, although I do also tend to like it more when it's mixed with a darker tobacco. It’s clearly tobacco, it’s got an indistinct but fairly light spice note. I’ve heard it’s not really authentic “Turkish” tobacco but since I don’t know what that is supposed to taste like exactly, I’m ok with that. It’s a little top-heavy but still full-flavored. There’s some base to it but it’s a light and bright, hay-like sort of tobacco base, again, that’s where I’m practically compelled to use it with a darker tobacco. On the other hand, if you wanted to get creative, it seems like it might be possible to use it just for the spice, which again is not distinct but tastes similar to a touch of cinnamon mixed with a touch of cardamom. And clove. Or Star anise. It’s really indistinct, is what I’m saying, despite being fairly prominent. FLV Turkish is a little woody, like a cedar or sandalwood vs oak or some other wood, not ashy. That base also has an oddly creamy mouthfeel, and it’s a little sweet, but not much. It’s not fruit on it’s own, really, but it does have a quality to it that makes it seem like it would be a great tobacco to pair with fruits, especially fruits like apples and pears.

I need this for a long list of recipes I love and recipes I want to try, and now I’m going to make it even longer.

It’s another Pheasant Ridge ingredient and I need it for [RY4 Custard](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/134966#ry4_custard_developed_by_developed). **TASK 10**

Also need it for [Chem Twista Lime](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/102517#chem_twista_lime_by_chemicalburnvictim), and [Wild Horses](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/131078#wild_horses_by_tamvapes), but those were added as tasks fairly recently. Time to try some new stuff:

[Smoky Apple Custard](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/230519#smoky_apple_custard_by_d0nc0rl30n3). Reviews sold this one to me. Well, that and the combination of the three custard flavors. **TASK 11**

And [Southern Comfort](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/175978#southern_comfort_by_slushy) a butter-pecan/almond tobacco that also pairs WF Vanilla Ruyan Custard with FLV Turkish. **TASK 12**

**Vanilla Bean**

Just a spicy, realistic natural vanilla bean top note, no base. I hadn’t thought of a use for this until very recently, when I wanted a touch of vanilla in a tea and didn’t want any kind of creamy anything in the base. It really reminds you that vanilla is a spice. Pretty unfun as a single flavor but seems like it could uplift and enhance just about any other vanilla without messing with the texture or add just a hint of vanilla bean. It’s not a super strong concentrate, there’s not a lot here at 0.75 or 1%, but I’m not sure how high you could take it without things getting weird.

I need it for Kopel’s Ginger Beer, Jazzy Girl’s Vanilla Rose Custard, and a few recipes I already plan to try, including a couple I’m really excited about. This [Sweet White Vanilla Cake](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/202026#sweet_vanilla_white_cake_by_badag) recipe looks super yummy, too. **TASK 13**

**Vanilla Custard**

It’s super smooth, thick and creamy, with a bright, forward pudding pop vanilla. It’s not really eggy in that I don’t get that warm fresh custard eggyiness from it. It’s more like a rich vanilla ice cream that does have egg in it, but the eggyiness doesn’t come across the way it does in a custard. There’s not a lot of space between this and FLV Vanilla Pudding. The vanilla is perfectly identical. The difference is in the base, but the difference is so minimal that unless I vape them side by side it’s hard to tell which is which. Like if you gave them to me side by side I could correctly identify it, but if you gave me just one of them and told me to pick which one it is, I can’t be sure that I wouldn’t guess wrong. The Vanilla Pudding is a little more jiggly and authentic to a pudding, while the Vanilla Custard is a little more buttery and has some more weight to it, but it’s a very miniscule difference.

Unless I’m able to work out a remix that removes it, I need FLV Vanilla Custard for [Skinny Mint](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/6997#skinny_mint_by_jbird), and the very recently mentioned Vanilla Rose Custard, and a few things I’m already planning to try. Adding [Shamrock Cookie](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/202382#shamrock_cookie_clone_by_denske) to the list, it has some of my favorite flavors in there and is apparently so good it made someone cry. **TASK 14**

**Vanilla Pudding**

See just above. Except I left off another important difference, the number of recipes they’re used in. Just looking at ATF: 1,235 for Vanilla Custard (82 public) vs 5,518 for Vanilla Pudding (427 Public). I’m sure they’re interchangeable in a good-sized chunk of those recipes, but surely not all and maybe not most.

It’s in so many favorite recipes that I won’t bother listing any of them. And about a dozen new ones already on the list, enough that I’m going to need another big bottle of the stuff soon. Here’s even more:

[Evolution](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/204786#evolution_by_diydownunderpippa). Bakery custard creamy thing that looks amazing. **TASK 15**

[Banana Custard Cake](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/256561#banana_custard_cake_by_mindfloodz) that I hope tastes like the picture. **TASK 16**

[Vanilla Gorilla](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/206394#vanilla_gorilla_by_kontravention). Another recipe that pairs VT Banana Custard with FLV Vanilla Pudding. Might as well, while I’ve got them both out. **TASK 17**

Like Vanilla Gorilla, [1-2-3 Ambrosia](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/163051#3_2_1_ambrosia_mother_fucker_by_sensory_overload) uses both Vanilla Pudding and INW Custard. The only other ingredient I’ll need to get out is FA Madagascar. **TASK 18**

Another one from the same mixer, who is someone who apparently shares my love of gooey-centered cookies: [Crack-Cookie-Caine](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/217240#crack_cookie_caine_by_sensory_overload). You really should be able to order cookies medium rare. **TASK 19**

[CV Creamy Strawberry Pudding V2](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/251901). Yeah, it’s just another strawberry cream, but I’m very interested in how that FA Strawberry Green works in there. **TASK 19**

[Custard Cookie](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/292758#custard_cookie_sadboy_remix_by_timboslice). Four components plus some sweetener and that can’t not be good. **TASK 20**

[Centaur](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/297140#centaur_by_mixnjuice). Well that’s weird as hell. Cactus, Strawberry, Vanilla Pudding, and Wild Melon? I’m scared to try it, but also scared I might be missing out on something special if I don’t. **TASK 21**

Finally, [Easy Peasy Key Lime Squeezy](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/212943#easy_peasy_key_lime_squeezy_by_humanpuck). Just three ingredients, VT Lemon Meringue Tart, INW Shisha Lime (love!) and the Vanilla Pudding. I have a soft spot for both simple recipes and creamy lime things. **TASK 22**

**Vanilla Tobacco**

Basically a vanilla-forward (caramel taking a backseat) RY4. I don’t find that it necessarily needs a steep (unlike FLV Mild Tobacco), but it definitely benefits greatly from one (like FLV RY4).
2% - After one week: Notably sweet, nutty, dry tobacco flavor upfront, some richer French-type vanilla behind it. Some darker sweetness. Lingering vanilla finish, but dry. Two weeks later (3-week steep): Smooth, very sweet tobacco with lots of vanilla behind it and some darker caramelly sweetness. A little nutty, a little grassy (in a good way, hay-like). Less dry than I remember it being two weeks before, smoother, but still a bit dry. The darker caramelly part seems a bit more prominent but still very much takes a back seat to the vanilla. It’s pretty yummy.

Already planned to mix three or four recipes that use it. I didn’t see another that I definitely want to mix, but I do feel inspired by a couple of them. [maga](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/280746#maga_by_nowar) looks like a very simple, nutty RY4 for MTL with a balance of delicious vanilla and caramel. [Peanut Butter Coffee Tobacco](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/242125#peanut_butter_coffee_tobacco_pbct_by_nmc) takes the nut and coffee notes in FLV RY4 and cranks them up to 11 using 11 ingredients to do it. I want to combine them without actually trying either.

PB Coffee RY4 V1 **TASK 23**

| Co. | Flavor                 | %   |
| --- | ---------------------- | --- |
| FLV | RY4                    | 1.5 |
| FLV | Vanilla Tobacco        | 1.5 |
| FLV | Red Burley             | 0.5 |
| WF  | Roasted Pecans & Cream | 2   |
| TFA | DX Peanut Butter       | 3   |

The goal is a nice balance of vanilla & caramel in a simple RY4 recipe with very distinct notes of peanut butter and coffee. The plan is to have layers of tobacco from the RY4 and Vanilla Tobacco, but neither of them as deep and dark as I want, so little touch of Red Burley to help with that. Like a counterweight, or the yang to their yin. The RY4 has plenty of caramel and the Vanilla Tobacco has plenty of vanilla, hopefully these %s will result in a good balance of the two. The WF Roasted Pecans & Cream is for pulling out more of the coffee note in the RY4. Have you tasted WF Roasted Pecans & Cream? If you have, you probably agree that this should work. Finally, all four of the aforementioned ingredients have varying degrees of vague nuttiness; I think just a little DX PB is all it will take to pull them in a distinctly PB direction.

I’m not even going to touch this until it has steeped for two weeks.

I have some concern that the result of V1 will be pretty close to what I’m aiming for, but wind up being a little too dry for my taste (thanks to DX PB). If that happens, the next version might have 0.25% FLV Lovage Root added, hopefully that would fix that problem without creating another.

**Virginia Tobacco**

I don’t love this really bright (what can I say, I have a type and it’s not the lighter ones) leafy/grassy tobacco that I get very slight spice-ish and almost-citus notes from, but I do love some of the things it’s been used to create.

Need it for Abuela, Cabin, and Burly Boiz. It’s in a couple of things I’ve already planned to try. Adding one more: [Bacco No8 - Peach](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/279684#bacco_no8_peach_by_saspi). I’ve tried a couple or three of peach tobacco recipes by others, even created one once, but this one looks like the best-ever peach tobacco. That combo of SSA Nectarines and WF Peach Pie and Cream, along with the light, middle, and dark tobaccos? Gimme gimme gimme. **TASK 24**

**Waffle**

**TRASH 5** Not just bad, a serious, what-in-the-actual-fuck level of awfulness. It tastes like mushrooms. Not just a little mushroom off-note, it tastes like a full-on in-your-face mushroom flavor. Nothing waffle-like about it. Something a little woody, like maybe the mushroom grew under a log. I have no idea how this could have wound up being labeled “Waffle” and sold to people, but the person responsible for that should be ashamed of themselves.

**[Redacted]**

I wound up with a pre-release bottle of a Flavorah flavor that never actually got released. Don’t know why I held on to it. Can’t tell you what it was, it’s a secret. But, you weren’t missing much. **TRASH 6**

**Watermelon**

It’s a great natural watermelon flavor but it’s very soft really has some trouble standing out in a mix, it needs some other watermelon or melon to help push it forward if you want a watermelon vape, which generally is going to pull away from the authenticity but it’s that’s sort of the game you play if you want to mix watermelon juice and not have it be full-on candy. You can’t just crank it up in concentration to make it work, it gets perfumey and rindy and just doesn’t work. It’s dense though, with some body to it, kind of fleshy, juicy, and sweet, like a watermelon.

I might want to make some more [Watermalone](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/53215#water_malone_live_mixing_summertime_recipes_by_enyawreklaw) someday, but the main reason for keeping FLV Watermelon in stock is [HoneyMelon Bubble Gum](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/35898#honeymelon_bubble_gum_by_jbird) **TASK 26** So yummy.

Another good reason is [Kittybit’s Melon Balls](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/158169#my_melon_balls_by_kittybit) and I see I failed to rate (5 stars) and review (shame on me) when I tried it before so I’ll correct that this time. **TASK 27**

**Wheat**

It no-shit tastes like wheat. Not wheat bread. Just like the essence of wheat. The tastes like the difference between whole wheat bread and white bread, not the bread, just the difference. Or how you can tell a wheat-based cereal from a corn- or rice-based cereal. Not the wheat-based cereal itself, just the difference. Very very light but musky honey taste and sweetness in the background.

I’ve tried some really, really interesting and not-at-all-bad tasting recipes that used FLV Wheat, but none that I feel incomplete without trying again and no new ones I wish to mix. Also, I haven’t gotten rid of nearly enough flavors this week. **TRASH 7**

**Whipped Cream**

I get that the difference is relatively subtle in the grand scheme of things, but this really tastes more like a marshmallow than a whipped cream. Specifically, it tastes so much like FLV’s own Marshmallow (the plain one, not Marshmallow Vanilla), that I think they could be pretty good subs for each other. The vanilla notes in FLV Whipped Cream and FLV Marshmallow are identical, just like the vanillas in FLV Vanilla Pudding and FLV Vanilla Custard are a different vanilla that’s also identical. And like the pudding and custard flavors, the difference between Whipped Cream and Marshmallow is mainly textural. The whipped cream is not as dry as marshmallow, but still a little dry for a whipped cream.

More like a damp marshmallow. It’s sweet, has some fluffy body, and that brighter vanilla that’s not too bright. No real dairy cream, making it less accurate than other whipped cream flavors.

People say it reminds them of FLV Frosting too, but it’s less sweet than Frosting with a lighter fluffy feeling, and the vanilla stands out as different to me. But if you told me this was a vanilla frosting and not whipped cream or marshmallow, I’d believe you, it doesn’t really taste exactly like anything and is close enough to grocery store vanilla frosting, probably. I think it’s quite tasty, it’s pretty flavorful, it’s just not the best whipped cream. On the plus side, I do know from multiple experiences that this fluffy sweet bright vanilla will sit right on top of a mix, so if you’re looking for “whipped cream on top” of something that’s a distinct layer, separate from another cream such as ice cream or custard, FLV Whipped Cream will do that, and because of that it can definitely be a better choice for some things than some of the more blend-y whipped cream flavors. Some whipped cream flavors (TFA for example) are highly effective emulsifiers. This is the opposite.

Although remixes that leaves it out are likely, I currently use this in my [Lucky’s Charms](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/99041#lucky_s_charms_by_id10_t) and [Holy Peepus](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/92939#holy_peepus_yearofmixing_by_id10_t) recipes. I’ll get back to work on those remixes **TASK 28** and **TASK 29**

But I also want to try this [Sunburn](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/266895#sunburn_by_mixnjuice) recipe. It’s a four-ingredient, crustless coconut cream pie. **TASK 30**

**White Chocolate**

Not especially sweet or flavorful on its own, subtle flavor, but full thickness and mouthfeel start to finish, smooth, slightly milky and coco-buttery.Tastes like halfway between real white chocolate and just some kind of generic thick cream flavor.

I have other white chocolate flavors that I am told will be better but so far this one is my favorite. I usually mix it with FW White Chocolate but have been told I might have better results just by using a much larger amount of FLV White Chocolate than I previously thought would be prudent. For now, I need it for the current versions of my [GTKK 2019](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/136863#gtkk_2019_by_id10_t) and J’Bird’s [Crazberry Crack](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/32359#crazberry_crack_by_jbird), and Holy Peepus, at least until a better white chocolate is ID’ed and those are remixed.

I also need it for [White Wolf](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/201941#white_wolf_vanilla_tobacco_custard_by_slushy), a delicious vanilla custard tobacco. **TASK 31**

**Wild Melon**

It tastes like vaping a whole bowl of mixed melon balls that’s about 15% cantaloupe balls, 50% honeydew, and 35% watermelon). This one is actually a bit juicy and pretty refreshing, without skimping much on the sweetness. It’s delightful. I’ve seen people describe it as candyish and even FLV’s own website called it “like a handful of hard candy” last time I checked, but it tastes pretty natural to me so I don’t know what that’s all about. Rather than tasting like some kind of exotic melon it really is more like multiple melon balls at once, as you can taste the distinct notes of honeydew, watermelon, and cantaloupe.

Appears (often alongside FLV Watermelon) in several recipes I love and others I plan to try. Also, [Changes In Latitudes](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/234739#changes_in_latitudes_by_kontravention) looks like a fantastic tropical fruit mix. **TASK 32**

**Wood Spice**

Really more of a wood flavor than a spice flavor. It pretty much tastes like sandalwood. Not like burning incense, but just like smelling the wood itself. But it fits in a recipe like a spice. Just a thin little top note, not a lot of depth to it. It’s not perfumy at all but seems like it belongs in a men’s cologne. Such a weird niche flavor.

I need it for The Politician by Chemical Burn Victim and I want to try Kopel’s Hinterlander. [Ron Burgundy RY4](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/231515#ron_burgundy_ry4_by_rug_ly) looks good, too. **TASK 33**

**Yakima Hops**

One of the best things ever. It’s bitter, but in the best possible way.. I dunno what to tell you, it tastes like hops. Piney, floral, and a little citrusy.

I need it for [Fiestas & Fiascos](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/14486#fiestas_and_fiascos_by_concreteriver) and [Deer Lodge](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/90272#deer_lodge_by_concreteriver), both by the great half-walrus half-man Rick the Concrete River, as well as [All Day](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/78350#all_day_by_maxsavage).

I like the look of this 1-23 recipe, [Hop Along Sally](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/142567#hop_along_sally_by_ediblemalfunction) that’s 3% TFA Honeysuckle, 2% Yakima Hops, 1% CAP Sweet Tangerine, but you know me and my mangoes, I’m not even going to mix the original, I’m just going to replace that Sweet Tangerine with an equal amount of FLV Sweet Mango and see what shakes out. **TASK 34**

**Yam**

I don’t think I’ve ever single-flavor tested this flavor (oops). But I have tried it in enough recipes to know that it pretty much tastes like what it says on the label. It’s a sweet potato, complete with a touch of that earthy skin taste. Lots of depth and thickness to it, just like a mouthful of skin-on sweet potato. None of those recipes were bad, but none of them were favorites, either. Maybe this one will be:

[Sajin](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/206139#sajin_by_wolfwheeler) appears to be a pumpkin pie cheesecake recipe. **TASK 35**

Also, maybe it’s just me, but that yam skin note is begging to be covered or incorporated into a spicy tobacco mix. I’ll give that a shot.

Sweet Pobacco V1 **TASK 36**

| Co. | Flavor          | %    |
| --- | --------------- | ---- |
| FLV | Yam             | 1.5  |
| FLV | Pumpkin Spice   | 0.75 |
| FLV | Native Tobacco  | 1.5  |
| FLV | Turkish Tobacco | 1.5  |

No doubt I’ll try that and want to add something to it, but it’s a start. If you’re looking at it and already have an idea what it needs, please let me know!

New Flavor Count: 2,541
