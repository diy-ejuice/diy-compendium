TASK OR TRASH is the name of the game.

# TFA

**Honey**

Skipping ahead to this one by [unselfish request](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/xb48n7/getting_rid_of_most_of_my_flavors_part_4/iny8hkq/)

Totally unusable even at 0.025%.Skiddlz said it best when he described it as tasting like "growing up in Ohio" and "dumpster flowers." Even as low as 0.025% (0.25% of a 10% dilution), it’s terrible. The honey sweetness tastes rotten and the primary flavor tastes like grandma’s cat pissed in her potpourri. It’s easily one of the worst flavors I have ever tried.  

**TRASH 1**.

# CAPELLA

**27 Bears**

Update on this one, I enjoyed [Stardrop](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/130449#stardrop_by_alfredpudding) quite a bit, but not to a “keeping a flavor just to be able to make more of this” level. At the moment, [Giant Swan](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/247312) is my only reason for hanging on to it. The 50ml of Giant Swan I mixed as a task in Part 2 was gone in like one day. That’s what I’m talking about. Recipes that make you vape more than normal because you love them that much.

I would like to find another one.

Can I give **YOU** a TASK? Yes, you. The one actual person reading this (I know the rest are just bots). Help me decide which of these to try next in the comments, please.

[Peach Mango Gummy Candy]( https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/199490#peach_mango_gummy_candy_by_rug_ly)  
  
**Acai**

Going back to part 3, I gave a recipe called [The Matrix](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/124000#the_matrix_by_8062282) a try. Not bad at all. I give it a solid 4/5 stars. But “keeping a flavor just to be able to make this again is 6/5. **TRASH 2**  

**Anise**

I told you I was very likely going to throw CAP Anise away, but first I wanted to try an old recipe for [Papaya Chai Tea](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/44225) because I saw it and developed a little crush on the idea of mixing papaya with chai spice, tea, and cream. Now I will make my own version of this, and when I do, the reward for completing the TASK will be getting to throw away CAP Anise.

This might be awhile. I know I want to use one of the better Chai flavors and not bother with trying to assemble one out of individual spice notes. But I’m not even sure which one. FLV Thai Chai, VSO Chai, and FLV Chai Spice all seem like excellent options. If the FLV Thai Chai worked, it could even wind up being a 2-banger recipe with less than 5% total flavor. Wouldn’t that be neat? But I think I’ll start with VSO simply because of how impressed I was with this [French V Chai Tea](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/219192#french_v_chai_tea_by_chasing84) recipe that used it, and for that I’ll need to add a little vanilla cream.  

The Ashton V1 **TASK 2**

Co. | Flavor | %
---|---|----
VSO | Chai Tea | 5
WF | Papaya | 2
WF | Vanilla Cream Extra | 1.5

I might wind up replacing all three of these ingredients with different ones. This is just a starting place.

**Chocolate Fudge Brownie V2**

I found this bottle unopened during Part 3. Mixed samples at 1% and 2%. I will not even be trying the 2%. 1% is... well, yes, there’s a chocolate fudge brownie or chocolate cake or cookie in there for sure, but it tastes slightly tootsie roll-ish and on top of that, a bit pukey. The pukey part is why it’s going in the **TRASH 3**. Apparently this is one of *those* types of V2s.

**Irish Cream**

Sweet slightly fluffy vanilla cream like a brighter vanilla pastry cream, with a hint of waxy chocolate. The vanilla is just like the vanilla in CAP Simply Vanilla, not the Vanilla Custard or French Vanilla vanilla. No whiskey. Nothing to explain why it’s called Irish Cream, and that waxy chocolate off note is a bit off-putting solo, though it might be covered up in a mix especially with another, better chocolate. **TRASH 4**

**Italian Lemon Sicily**

Fairly soft, sweet lemon, not a real punchy flavor. I didn’t find it to be harsh, especially compared to other lemons, but some people have, so YYMV. It’s not as natural and full as fresh FA Lemon Sicily but it has one big upside compared to it, not fading nearly as bad, though it does fade, like a lot of lemons. Goes into bakeries well unlike a lot of other lemons that will just sit on top of them. Works very well as an accent.  3% is more filled out than 2% but still not a very forward flavor. I don’t want to don’t throw it away yet just on principle. Just because I’m going in alphabetical order doesn’t mean CAP’s Lemon Sicily should be thrown out before FA’s, which is very much the lesser of the two Sicilys IMO, unless you’re doing strictly shake and vape/short steepers because FA is gonna virtually disappear.  Also, while it might not be one of the best lemons by itself, it turns up in a ton of recipes and now seems like a good time to check some of those out.

[A Real Orange Juice? Finally?](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/157915#a_real_orange_juice_finally_by_motherpunker) **TASK 3**

[Post Torrone](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/263676#post_torrone_lemon_almond_nougat_cookie_by_alch3m1st) **TASK 4**

**Jelly Candy**

Vaping it as a single flavor is about as much fun as eating unflavored jello, but it is a useful additive for making fruits and other flavors more like jelly candies, not really a gummy bear type of flavor, but more like one of those pectin-based homemade gummy or jelly candies. It has a slight citrus flavor and a fluffy type texture, much lighter than gummy, like a marshmallow that doesn’t have any vanilla, and it’s sweet. Really quite a bit like unflavored jello, I think. Has some neat properties for bending and smoothing flavors and hiding off notes. 4% has a soapy detergent-like off note that I didn’t get from 1 to 3%.

My first thought on considering dumping Jelly Candy is, “but then I couldn’t make [Mango Tango](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/29425#mango_tango_by_id10_t).” And that’s when I remembered that I’ve been meaning to upgrade that recipe for a long time. I know it can be done better without a time crunch or contest parameters, and with a lot of new flavors and more years of experience. Someday, all the ingredients in this might be replaced. There are a bunch of other gummy candy-type flavors that might work just as well if not better, but for now, I think CAP Jelly Candy will be the only flavor I’m keeping from the original recipe.

Mango 2 Tango v1 **TASK 5**

Co. | Flavor | %
---|---|----
CAP | Jelly Candy | 3
FLV | Red Cinnamon | 0.25 |  
FA | Indian Mango | 3
CAP | Super Sweet | 0.50
WF | Cotton Candy Jelly Bean | 1
FLV | Sweet Mango | 1

I also need to remake [Spicy Icy](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/116249#spicy_icy_chamoyada_mangonada_by_id10_t) but I plan to leave the Jelly Candy in that one as well, for now I’m just trying to upgrade the mango part.

Spicy Icy Chamoyada Mangonada 2 v1 **TASK 6**

Foo | Bar | text
---|---|----
FLV | Apple Filling | 1.25
FLV | Heat | 1.5
FLV | Sweet Mango | 2
FLV | Mango | 2
FA | Indian Mango | 2
CAP | Jelly Candy | 1
CAP | Super Sweet | 0.5
FA | Polar Blast | 1.25
BCF | WS-23 (30%) | 1.75
TFA | Sweet & Tart | 0.5

And there are a few recipes by others I feel like I need to try, for one reason or another.  

[Peach Ring Gummy](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/205599#peach_ring_gummy_by_sublimeice) **TASK 7** in case I want to steal that Sour Ball Candy trick later.

[Pink Cloud](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/105262#pink_cloud_by_statch) I’m terrified of that much CAP Sweet Lychee and that much CAP Jelly Candy but people have tried it and not died. **TASK 8** to put Jelly Candy’s special properties to the test.

[Strap-on Jelly Candy](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/91522#strap_on_jelly_candy_by_chrisdvr1) **TASK 9** because I need an extenuating circumstance to pass up on a Strapon recipe and am not really in one at the moment.

[Jiggly Mango Boy](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/252757#jiggly_mango_boy_by_chumbles). irresistible **TASK 10**

**Juicy Lemon**

Candy lemon, not lemon juice. Sweet and syrupy, not especially tart. Needs a more tart or zesty lemon to compliment it except maybe in a sweet candy lemon that’s not supposed to actually taste like a lemon. Nothing really wrong with it but does taste quite artificial without being pledged. Some throat but not really enough to do more than register, I wouldn’t call it harsh.

I have enough other, better, candy lemon flavors, probably gonna toss this one... soon. But first I want to try this intriguing [Lemon Apricot Cereal](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/259826#lemon_apricot_cereal_repost_adv_by_chasing84). **TASK 11**

**Juicy Orange**

Not actually juicy. Unfortunately I get a lot of throat hit from this one, though I’m aware that plenty of people don’t. Shame because it kinda tastes like OJ. But I also found it to be pretty weak, and then upon adding more to try to compensate, the throat gets worse and it has a really waxy thing that starts building. Sweet, orange essence without much body at lower %, waxy at higher concentrations. So, it is difficult to work with, at least to me. I have tried some really excellent recipes that made it work, but I’m pretty sure any of them would have been even better, or at least had an end result that was easier to reach, if they’d just used WF Orange Juice instead. **TRASH 5**

**Juicy Peach**

I’ve used it in mixes where its sharp edges were smoothed out by other ingredients, but this one actually catches in my throat quite a bit by itself. Not really candy or really natural, but less candied and more canned. It’s a full bodied flavor that’s a bit syrupy textured rather than chewy or fleshy, with the thick syrupy part coming in after the brighter peach top notes. It has a sharper citrus flavor than other peaches and mixing with apricot makes it tastes kind of like a nectarine. It has a sugary sweetness, but a bit of floral aftertaste at higher percentages. Efforts to make something like a cooked peach flavor (using things like FA Liquid Amber, etc) seem to work better with this one than with TFA and a few others, for some reason.

I need it to make [Titanic](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/48608#titanic_by_id10_t), so it’s not going anywhere, I just want to do something else with it.

I will try this [Unicorn Blood](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/157438#unicorn_blood_by_outofhand), looks interesting **TASK 12**

And this [Kiss My Peach](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/110929#kiss_my_peach_by_diydownunderpippa). Looks Juicy.  **TASK 13**

**Kiwi**

Be careful with this one, or don’t use it all. At 2%, I just got a soft and very sweet but dry flavor that didn’t taste anything like a kiwi and was more like some kind of pear. Tried doubling it and the result was no good at all. It tasted like this flavor might have actually gone bad since the last time I had it out, it might not have anything to do with the concentration. Because it literally tastes rotten at 4%. It’s a little tart, but also very vegetal, and again rotten, so it sorta tastes like rotten rhubarb. **TRASH 6**  

**Kiwi Strawberry**

I had to push this up from 4% to 6% to really get what I could maybe identify as strawberry and kiwi flavor. At 4%, it tastes more like a juicy, very sweet, indecipherable berry-ish melon-ish pear-ish fruit with a very slight bitter aftertaste. 6% is more like strawberry and kiwi, I guess, but still not right, and also the bitter aftertaste is less slight. I could see using a little of it to sweeten and moisten a variety of flavors besides strawberries and kiwis, like melons and pears. But I would be careful about using too much because of that aftertaste. **TRASH 7**

**Lemon Lime**

Lime forward with some lemon in the back. Pretty much a flat 7-up, though the lime is a bit sharper than that. Thick and sweet and syrupy like flat soda would be but still with some nice tartness to it. Very versatile as far as % used and what to mix it with, depending on how present you want it to be.

Another staple that isn’t going anywhere anytime soon. I need it to make [1 2 3 Cranberry Sprite](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/86917#1_2_3_cranberry_sprite_by_id10_t), and various similar recipes, which reminds me I need to mix up some [1 2 3 Mango Sprite](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/171846#1_2_3_mango_sprite_by_rushg93) **TASK 14**

And might as well give [1 2 3 Peach Breeze](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/183788#1_2_3_peach_breeze_by_novitec) a shake while I’m at it **TASK 15**

It’s also key to  [Bert’s Soda Base](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/156816#berts_soda_base_by_staybert), which means it’s key to Staybert’s soda recipes, begs the question, why haven’t I tried [Rainforest Soda](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/157923#rainforest_soda_remix_by_staybert) yet? **TASK 16**

Or [Grapefruit Pineapple Soda](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/190467#grapefruit_pineapple_soda_by_staybert), which I literally asked for **TASK 17**

**Lemon Meringue Pie**

Am I insane or is this a nearly perfect lemon meringue pie single flavor? Mild lightly creamy lemon custard or curd. Sweet meringue that’s smooth tastes a little toasted. Pie crust notes are solid. Very much a plain pie crust like a mass produced one. The only thing I could say about it is that the lemon curd part could stand to be quite a bit more tart, but we have other lemons we could fix that with; FE Lemon immediately comes to mind. I think the complexity of this thing could limit its use in anything but a lemon meringue pie, but it might fit in for other bakeries as well, like lemon cookies and such. I’d kinda like to try to build a lemon fried pie or lemon moon pie out of it.

Found a recipe for [Lemon Cake](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/106186#lemon_cake_by_jazzy_girl) that uses it and looks good. **TASK 18**

Looks like Lemon Fried Pie and Lemon Moon Pie are things I’ll have to come up with myself if I want them.

Lemon Fried Pie Attempt V1 **TASK 19**

Co. | Flavor | %
---|---|----
WF | Glazed Donut | 2
TFA | Pie Crust | 0.75
CAP | Lemon Meringue Pie | 5
FE | Lemon | 1

Lemon Moon Pie Attempt V1 **TASK 20**

Co. | Flavor | %
---|---|----
FW | Graham Cracker | 3
CAP | Sugar Cookie | 2
CAP | Lemon Meringue Pie | 5
OoO | Marshmallow Vanilla | 2

If anyone has, or thinks they might have, a better idea for how to take a first crack at these profiles, I would love to hear it!

**Lemon Meringue Pie V2**

This is ridiculous. There’s no lemon in it at all. There’s some of that fluffy meringue-ish taste upfront but it comes across more like powdered sugar, then that’s followed by a heavy, grahammy crust flavor with just a hint of citrus soaked into it. Find a use for it, sure, there’s nothing offensive about it. It’s just weird that something called CAP Lemon Meringue Pie would have no lemon. And it’s V2. It seems like V2 should be better than the original. What a waste. **TRASH 8**

**Licorice**

I don’t hate vaping licorice! I think I might have given some people the idea that I do because I get almost unreasonably angry when things taste like black licorice or anise when they’re not supposed to. But if it’s supposed to taste like that, we’re good.

Really impressed with this one. I was not expecting this much complexity from Capella Licorice. Tastes like black licorice, but not like a Twizzler or a jelly bean. It’s sweet like candy, especially in the thick, syrupy base, but there’s a lot going on here especially on top. It’s warm, spicy, does taste like it has anise in it, but is also slightly herbal tasting on top, herbal in a way that reminds me of fennel, with hints of vanilla and something almost like salt. It leaves a tingle like I’d just eaten something salty. I could actually see myself using this as a low amount, for example to spice up something like a root beer or ginger beer vape. I’d love to see what something like half or 1% of this does to a recipe like MrBurgandy’s Fitz’s recipe or Kopel’s Ginger Beer recipe.

My favorite licorice flavor is the new one by WF, but CAP is a close second.

However, I could not think of a recipe I really needed it for. So, I’ll try some and see.

[Blackstrap](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/197520#blackstrap_by_kittybit) **TASK 21**

[Black Drums of War](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/209901#black_drums_of_war_by_kittybit) **TASK 22**

[Licorice Berry Much](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/159538#licorice_berry_much_by_kittybit) **TASK 23**

[Shoggoth](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/252690#shoggoth_by_anawfulwizard) **TASK 24**

[Black Soda](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/224823#black_soda_by_ediblemalfunction) **TASK 25**

**Lime**

Tastes like sweetened, watered down somewhat realistic lime juice. There’s a bit of lime zest on top middle is somewhat more artificial yet also kinda funky like a real lime was involved here and wasn’t the freshest lime in the basket. It finishes syrupy sweet and basically tastes like slightly over-sweetened, over-watered down limeade made from limes whose skins are starting to turn brown. NOT like Sonic Limeade that’s made of Sprite or whatever and quite carbonated, but like a store brand limeade from a cardboard concentrate tube from the freezer.

Better limes out there, no recipes I want to try. **TRASH 9**

**Marshmallow**

Yep, the OG CAP Marshmallow. Why do I still have this? It was discontinued like 35 years ago (in vape years). Flavor hoarding is a special type of mental illness and I’m trying to recover here. It’s probably not even any good anymore anyway.  **TRASH 10**

**Menthol**

I’m pretty sure it’s just menthol, and there are other places to get menthol. Surely any number of them would work as a sub if you knew how much to use, but that is the trick. Is it 10% menthol, or less? 20%? 30%. Is there maybe another ingredient or two in there? Why hasn’t a menthol aficionado created a menthol substitution chart? Is there even a person who could accurately be called a menthol aficionado? CAP’s seems to be a bit weaker than some of the others. Not being a big fan of menthol but not being super adverse to it either, all I know to do is look for recipes. And I didn’t see any that I really wanted to make, but if we string together as many “century heat” days next summer as this past summer, I might regret not giving [Lake Effect](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/28144#lake_effect_by_ilbvaping) a mix. **TRASH 11**

**Meringue**

Very sweet, creamy and full but airy and fluffy at the same time, like meringue should be. Slight egg-white note. Not a crisp toastiness, like the inside of a meringue topping with the top layer peeled off, but some darker caramelized business, just a touch.  Mostly tastes like meringue but there’s a weird off note in there, like a nondescript berry-like fruit with some tartness.

CAP Meringue might be fine for pairing with any kind of tart fruit like berries and kiwi, not sure I would use it for any other meringue thing. Not even lemon, because that tartness really tastes more like raspberry or under ripe strawberry than a citrus tartness. It might be a good ingredient for a sugary berry cereal recipe, though.  

CAP Meringue is notably more potent than a lot of other CAP Silverline flavors. I tried it at 2.5%, and it seemed like 2% should be plenty, which is very different from many of the Silverlines that need to be pushed up pretty high to work.

Nothing made with it caught my eye. But it seems excellent for pavlova so I will try to make a quick little strawberry and kiwi pavlova out of it.

Quick Little Pavlova V1 **TASK 26**

Co. | Flavor | %
---|---|----
CAP | Meringue | 2
OoO | Whipped Cream | 2
FA | Kiwi | 2
FA | Juicy Strawberry | 2
FA | Meringue | 1

**Milkshake**

 It’s not a full milkshake flavor in one concentrate, I think you still need a nice thick, rich ice cream flavor at least, but it certainly tastes like some pieces of a milkshake, specifically the milk and added malty sweetness. Definitely would use this over most milk or cream flavors for an authentic milkshake. Maybe over all milk or cream flavors. You know how people will add a small amount of a cookie or other bakery flavor to finish a milkshake? I think the malty sweetness here has both that and the milk covered. Just bring your own ice cream and whatever other flavor, like chocolate or strawberry, that you want.

There are already some really great looking recipes created with this fairly new flavor, but I haven’t had any chance to play with it on my own, so I’ll start by just taking my [1-2-3 VIC](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/215957#1_2_3_vic_by_id10_t) vanilla ice cream base and throwing 4% CAP Milkshake at it to see what happens. **TASK 27**  

**Mixed Berry**

It tastes terrible. There’s a definite tart and sweet mixed berry quality to it, but it’s floral AF and has a weird cinnamony spice note that pretty much left me feeling like I just vaped grandma’s wild berry potpourri. It’s also dry and a little on the thin side. **TRASH 12**

**New Marshmallow**

The first time I tried this, I hated it for not being Old Marshmallow, which was glorious.

But there are other reasons to hate it as well. It tastes like a marshmallow made with a viciously artificial, overly bright, and slightly bitter kinda medicine-y vanilla upfront. Like it has that surgery sweet depth, thickness, and gooey sweetness of the inside of a marshmallow, but the vanilla is not great at all. I’ve got gobs of other, better marshmallow flavors. **TRASH 13**

**New York Cheesecake**

Another super staple, and one that turns up in tons of recipes, often recipes that don’t have anything to do with cheesecake. I just mixed a cereal with milk recipe with it in there. Versatility. Gotta love it.

Decent, thick, nearly crustless cheesecake. Often seen used at 6%ish because you need that much for a full-fledged cheesecake, but I get a fake-butter off-note that high. At lower concentrations it can add an interesting tangy note and thick, smooth mouthfeel to custards and creams, so it can be a very useful flavor.

If I want a cheesecake, there are other flavors I’m more inclined  to use. INW, PUR, JF, FLV. I mostly need this in case I want my [Custard NOW](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/73934#custard_now_by_ediblemalfunction).

I’m going to try some new things this time, since I’m not currently experiencing a custard emergency.

[1-2-3 Strawberry Cheesecake Fluff](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/147632#1_2_3_strawberry_cheesecake_fluff_by_kittybit). Looks simple and delicious. **TASK 28**

[Cheesecake RY4](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/138894#cheesecake_ry4_by_lonesomerhodestn) **TASK 29**

[Mustachio Ice Cream](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/279639#mustachio_icecream_by_jasonvape420) **TASK 30**

**New York Cheesecake V2**

Thankfully not barfy. Tastes like they took out the good stuff without replacing it with the barf stuff. Not anywhere near as rich as the OG, but also doesn’t have that hint of fake butter off note I get from V1. Pretty much tastes like crustless cheesecake but not as robust. Fairly thick body, some tanginess, does have a creamy feel, needs to be a little sweeter. Has a hint of vanilla. Obviously I prefer the richness and depth of the V1, but this is not a bad replacement if you’re scared of the diketones or just want to avoid excess butter taste in your cheesecake. Could be a good, versatile addition to all kinds of creams and custards as well.  

Off the top of my head, my only reason for hanging on to this would be if I wanted to sell or try to clone a commercial recipe that uses it. That would make it an excellent candidate for the trash, but not until after I try that [McD’s Guava Creme Pi](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/277657#mcd_s_guava_creme_pi_by_rekohms) recipe that’s still on my to-do list from Part 3.

I’ll give this [Strawberry Cheesecake](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/202071#strawberry_cheesecake_by_shrtyska9) recipe a spin while I’ve still got NY Cheesecake V2 around. **TASK 31**

**Nut Muffin**

6% sample was probably a little high, there’s a sharpness to it at 6% that tastes like overflavoring to me. I’m thinking 4% would be much better. BUT, underneath that sharpness, I can tell this tastes just like banana nut bread, but without any banana. Pretty cool if you want to build your own banana nut bread, enhance the nuttiness of another one (it is really nutty). Or build some kind of other nutty breakfast bread thing. I do need to add though, it’s very dry. As can be the case the nutty flavors, so I’m not mad at it, I just think it’s probably worth noting that vaping just a little of CAP Nut Muffin made me very thirsty.

This is a pretty new flavor that I haven’t had a chance to play with yet. Went out hoping to find what this flavor seems to be asking to be used in: TFA Banana Nut Bread, CAP Nut Muffin, a backup banana, and maybe another accent flavor or two. That’s what it tastes like it was born to do.

I didn’t find anything quite as simple as that, but [Banana Bread WIth Honeycomb Butter](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/253625#banana_bread_with_honeycomb_butter_by_lukeloop) sounds even better than the simple little banana nut bread thing I had in mind. **TASK 32**

And I’m going to put this man’s [Creamy Nuts](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/259474#creamy_nuts_by_chasing84) in my mouth while I’ve got the Nut Muffin out. **TASK 33**

**Orange Creamsicle**

The orange tastes mostly like a creamsicle orange but also tastes a little bitter, like orange medicine. The cream tastes like vanilla cream inside a creamsicle, but the orange to cream ratio is way off, there’s not nearly enough orange here. What orange is there is also a little throaty, especially for the dearth of flavor that’s there. The cream is thick and rich enough to do it well without going overboard into buttery or custardy territory. Does that sort of cheap, fluffy vanilla cream that’s halfway between whipped cream and ice cream really well. Vanilla tastes just like the vanilla in CAP Vanilla Whipped Cream, a bright, artificial vanilla, just as it should. This flavor just needs quite a bit of help in the orange department, I wouldn’t be concerned about the medicine-y aspect of it, because it seems like the orange is so light it could be easily covered up with a better orange, or probably even some other fruit like tangerine or mango, maybe even pineapple. Not a bad flavor, but not one I can’t live without. **TRASH 14**

**Orange Mango**

Oddly bottom-heavy flavor that tastes like orange kool aid powder with CAP Sweet Mango in it. Exhale starts out flavorless and dry, then the flavor builds, starting with an candied, not at all zesty, orange kool aid flavor, then an increasing amount of mango, with an overripe cloying sweetness borderline on rotten, rich even oddly little buttery down real low in the base, but dry, neither juicy nor creamy.  I guess it’s better than single-flavor CAP Sweet Mango because that artificial orange covers up part of it. If I look for it, the stevia is apparent in this one at 5%, there’s a different sweetness to finish, some sugar lips, and a bit of bitter edge to it that lingers in the aftertaste.  

I had  to revise my starting number of flavors, this was accidentally listed twice. Also will be subtracting one from my current number of flavors because this is going in the **TRASH 15**  

**Pancake Syrup**

This one is tricky, and not very good, IMO, but someone with a palate in which I have some trust told me that using a little of this with WF Maple Syrup Candy is the best luck he’s had with maple, so YMMV. All I can say is that if you decide to give it a try, use it carefully. I tried it at 3% the first time and it tasted like a little maple behind the sweet aftermath of a fireworks show. Kind of like how a match head smells. Sulfurous. Dropped it down to 0.3% and it was much less offensive, no more fireworks taste, but also quite weak, with just a hint of maple. Figured there might be a sweet spot in there where it’s flavorful but not match heady. At 1%, I did not find any bad off notes, but it’s very dark and not really all that sweet, kind of like molasses rather than maple. It’s also not super flavorful, but I could see how you could use it to darken a maple and not have it be so maple flavored frosting-ish. So it could be a useful tool, I’m sure, but it’s a tricky one, and not a great maple at all by itself. I don’t feel like messing with it. **TRASH 16**

**Passion Fruit**

Juicy passion fruit wrapped in a dirty vegetable peel. Definitely identifiable as a passionfruit and I think the juiciest one out of all I have tried, but it has issues. It’s weak up front, not really having that tart bite. Where it should have a deep sweet tropical funk along with the general passion fruit flavor, it has a deep earthy almost dirty - like literally dirt - along with its very syrupy sweetness. Finally, there’s a prominent green vegetal-type finish just out of nowhere. Although the juiciness is nice, the flavor isn’t otherwise super bold. Even when you crank it up, it’s like a soft background flavor.  Nothing I’m dying to make with this, and at least 10 other passion fruit flavors I’d rather play with? **TRASH 17**

**Peaches & Cream**

Yellow peach with a slight green, almost astringent off note, like a severely underripe peach, on top of a light, buttery, sugary sweet, whipped dairy cream. The cream underneath is very competent for something like a peaches and cream, but the slight bitterness of that peach distracts from it a little, especially when compared to much better peaches and cream flavor and DIY’ing your own peaches and cream. **TRASH 18**

**Pear with Stevia**

I’ve tried this one at 3 and 4% and definitely like it better at 3%. It’s very sweet but also has a little bitter aftertaste, you could say it’s bittersweet, but at 3% there seems to be less bitter but still plenty of sweet. Like lots of sweet, and even a little sugar lips finish. It’s not a very flavorful flavor otherwise, though, and it has some issues.

CAP Pear with Stevia starts right off with just a tiny bit of an earthy pear skin note like a natural pear, but then quickly gets very sweet and but a little bland otherwise.

It has pear mixed with an odd grapey flavor like those white grapes that are super sugary, devolving into just bland but thick sweetness that lingers and has a subtle but odd, vegetal as opposed to chemical, bitter edge to it. Although it’s kind of bland and has that lingering bittersweet thing, it’s very full bodied and I could see CAP Pear with Stevia being used to sweeten and fill out the soft body on a pear, apple, or white grape flavor.

Got plenty of pears. I’m good. Don’t need this one. **TRASH 19**

**Peppermint**

A way better candy cane than FW Candy Cane. Pretty basic, off-note free simple candy flavor, but really sugary sweet with a creamish kinda syrupy candy base. Pretty much what I would have expected from a Capella Peppermint. What I didn’t expect was for it to be so weak, concentration wise, I really had to crank it up to 10% to get a full flavor out of it and trying it at 12% still wasn’t too much. It’s like one of those SilverLine CAP flavors in concentration. But once you crank it up there it’s not a weak, soft flavor, it’s got an appropriate peppermint bite to it. Again, pretty perfect Candy Cane flavor, but that sugary sweetness might make it a little less versatile than some other peppermint flavors. It’s just so blatantly candy.

I have a slight personal preference for more icy peppermint flavors, but this is certainly a good one. Went looking for stuff to mix with it and came back with some weird new shit for me to try.  

[Shore Slime](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/256435#shore_slime_vanilla_mint_custard_mix_1_of_the_trilogy_by_chasing84) so many yummy things in one bottle **TASK 34**

[The Dormant Cactus](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/253910#the_dormant_cactus_by_philosaphucker) TASK. WTF, but also **TASK 35**

Oof. I have not done a good job of getting rid of flavors this time.
