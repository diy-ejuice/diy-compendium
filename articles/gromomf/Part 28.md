Starting flavor count: 2,600 (down from 2,972)

TASK OR TRASH - Each flavor gets assigned at least one task or it goes in the trash.

# CAPELLA

**Cranberry**

Update. I mixed the two best-looking recipes I could find that used this and while both of them earned five-star reviews, neither turned out to be something I just *had* to make again. Therefore, CAP Cranberry is now **TRASH 1**

Also, someone told me TFA Cranberry mixed with CAP Cranberry and a little CAP Sweet Currant made a great cranberry so I tried that. There was something to it that makes me lean toward yes on mixing CAP Sweet Currant and a cranberry flavor, but the TFA Cranberry (and probably to some degree CAP as well) made it taste too medicine-like for my liking.

Matter of fact, I’ll just go ahead and get this out of the way:

# TFA

**Cranberry**

It’s very weirdly warm and cool at the same time, like camphor medicine. Like watered down Icy Hot muscle rub. Or hot mint tea. Basically tastes like undersweetened cranberry juice in the middle of all that, tart and a little sharp, apart from that weird fire and ice effect, but I don’t know what to do with it. I checked TFA website because I wanted to see what the hell was going on here, and there’s actually menthol and menthyl acetate in there, which explains the cooling sensation, well as ethyl alcohol and benzyl alcohol, which might explain the weird warmth. I don’t know what they’re trying to do here with all that nonsense, but it’s strange. Like they tried to counter the warm with cooling and just made a mess that’s like cranberry-flavored cold sore medicine.  **TRASH 2**

# CAPELLA

**Concord Grape with Stevia**

Update. I think everyone should have this flavor to try [Gruber Grape V2](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/193593#gruber_grape_v2_by_foment_life) at least once, as it is a masterwork that shows what a talented, determined, and/or lucky mixer can accomplish, with a profile that many others have tried and tried and tried and failed at doing. But, not a recipe I want more of enough to keep CAP Concord Grape with Stevia. I gave that flavor one more chance to be maintained in stash and [Shigeo Kageyama](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/270432#shigeo_kageyama_by_wolfwheeler) delivered. When I want to taste Peanut Butter and Grape Jam together, this is one I’ll want to mix again. By the time I get this far into my task list I’ll likely be ready to enjoy it again, so, **TASK 1**

Since I’m keeping CAP Concord for more of that, I’ll try a one more and if that recipe goes on the favorites list as well - [Jacked Up Grape My Way](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/257232#jacked_up_grape_my_way_by_daytimefrank). **TASK 1.5**

# WONDER FLAVORS

**Grape Candy (Sour)**

Skipping way ahead to address this one now, since its use in Shigeo Kageyama makes it a keeper as well.

I do not like this flavor by itself, but I don’t see Shigeo working without it. Pretty sure that grape layer would not be so separate from the peanut butter part without it.

When I tried WF Grape Candy (Sour) standalone, I thought it seemed like you could get something better just by mixing WF Sour Ball Candy with FLV Grape, or if you were set on only using WF, even WF Sour Ball Candy and WF Grape Juice would be better. I got mostly sweet purple grape candy body that was a little soft, not super assertive like I want in a candy (seems to be an issue with grape flavors in general). The top note is a little odd, kind of balsamic vinegary, and weirdly warm. It did leave me with the feeling that I’d just eaten something sour, but wasn’t really puckeringly sour. It tastes like it has a lot of malic acid in it. It seemed like it needed something to give it a more sour top note and also another candy grape to fill in the middle.

But, in Shegeo, it seems to be doing magic with the CAP Concord, and now I want to see what else it can do.

[Ultra Violet Kidney Stones](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/243516#ultra_violet_kidney_stones_by_thevapingbuddah) - a supposedly very accurate Monster Ultra Violet, which seems like a great use for it to me. **TASK 2**

[Sour Blue Raz Taffy](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/273216#sour_blue_raz_taffy_all_wf_by_bob_ohms2low). Well, it worked in peanut butter and grape taffy. **TASK 3**

[Pale Violet Punch](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/306467#pale_violet_punch_by_gabe8986). There it is with WF Sour Ball Candy and FLV Grape, and TFA Grape Juice, too. Which makes me wonder if it’s even really necessary here, but looks pretty good either way. **TASK 4**

# FLAVORAH

**Cactus Aloe**

Reminds me of dried apple slices in the body, not the crunchy apple chips but the soft chewy dried apple slices, but has an aloe drink top note, so like green apple slices dipped in that, with some slight notes of lychee or white grape in the middle. I don’t need it. **TRASH 3**
  
**Cactus Apple**

Again with the dried green apple slices. The spongy ones you can buy at the sore next to the dried figs, apricots, raisins, and such. It really matches that concentrated sort of slightly sticky naturally sugary sweetness and very light fermented-type note. Chewy, thick. Worth noting I get some harshness from this, but I’m sure not everyone does.

At the moment it doesn’t seem necessary to keep, but there are a couple of four-flavor all-Flavorah recipes I want to check out before tossing it:

[Centaur II](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/297268#centaur_ii_by_mixnjuice). That’s a really interesting combination of Flavorah flavors: Cactus Apple, Ripe Mango, Wild Melon, and ... Vanilla Pudding? **TASK 5**

[Flavorah Gives You Wings](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/222645#flavorah_gives_you_wings_by_rug_ly). I don’t actually trust FLV Energy Drink not be weird, but it’s in a couple of other things I’m already planning to mix and I’m interested in the how the other three FLV flavors work together: Cactus Apple, Citrus Soda, Pink Guava. **TASK 6**
  
**Candy Roll**

**TRASH 4**.  I can’t use this. I want to, but I can’t. I don’t know what’s in this flavor that makes me react so strongly to it, but every single time I take that first hit or three from a fresh drip of any recipe using this flavor, I taste something like rubbing alcohol. Every single time, even down at 0.5%. It never steeps out. It does go away after the first few hits, but every time I drip more of it, there’s that rubbing alcohol back, and it’s unpleasant. That’s why I can’t use it at all. I want the first hit of something to be impressive, not unpleasant. Between redrippings though, it’s pretty nice. It’s not quite American Smarties (Smarties means something much different in the UK and Canada) because it’s a bit sharper and more tart than those, but it’s not as sharp and tart as Sweet-Tarts, either. It’s like Smarties and Sweet-Tarts had a baby. It does a compressed powdered sugar thing very well without being too chalky or dry and has a thick, full-bodied flavor. The fruit, though more forward than Smarties and and less in your face than a Sweet-Tart, is not really identifiable. I can pick out orange and enough other stuff to know that orange is definitely not alone, it’s a mishmash of fruity on top of that sweet powdery base.

**Cantaloupe**

I haven’t found a better natural cantaloupe flavor than FLV’s. Ripe, authentic cantaloupe. Pretty soft. Mellow, you might say. It’s very thick and creamy feeling, like a really ripe cantaloupe has a creamy mouthfeel. It’s worth noting that it’s deceptively soft, as even 1% can give a recipe a ton of cantaloupe flavor, washing over even bolder flavors with its softness. FLV Cantaloupe is also not quite as wet and juicy as I want a cantaloupe flavor to be, but it’s not really dry, either.

I already need it for the Honeymelon Bubblegum recipe added to the to-do list last week. But I bet I can find another use or two for it, maybe one of these:

[A melon creamsicle](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/277881#fu_by_wolfwheeler) sounds delightful. **TASK 7**

[Tango Flamingo](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/288875#tango_flamingo_by_eyemsam) looks interesting. **TASK 8**

**Caramel**

Fantastic ingredient, terrible caramel. Thin and dry, mostly tastes like raw brown sugar. Not creamy or anything like that, just a light buttery flavor mostly hiding in there somewhere. Some dryness, a little harshness in the finish standalone, but haven’t seen that show up in a mix that I can recall. I would not even try to think of this as a caramel. I’ve actually relabeled mine “Brown Sugar” and use it like a brown sugar flavor. It’s a cleaner, clearer brown sugar than TFA Brown Sugar Extra, and works great for bakery mixes.

The only thing I already know I need it for is my [Retaliatory Tariffs](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/108011#retaliatory_tariffs_by_id10_t) recipe. Mmmmm... **TASK 9**

But it shows up in a few things I’m already planning to mix, and there are a couple  more that look too good to pass up.

[Toffee Cookie Crack](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/248615#return_of_the_mac_toffee_cookie_crack_by_spdrjrslm) has a ton of ingredients, but it looks like it might be worth pulling all that out, and has glowing reviews. **TASK 10**

[The Kennedy by Conspiracy Remix](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/214225#the_kennedy_by_conspiracy_remix_by_slushy). Warm vanilla sugar cookie with caramel and pistachio topping? Yes. **TASK 11**

**Carrot**

It’s raw, not cooked carrot. Not a carrot cake carrot. Carrots change when you cook them and this one hasn’t been cooked. I’m not sure how you get from here to there with this, it doesn’t taste like some of the tricks you use to cook things like berries and peaches will work here. It tastes like a sweet baby carrot but just a little earthy like an unpeeled carrot. I’m not saying it’s not a good flavor or that you can’t make something awesome out of it, I just don’t want to vape carrots that badly. **TRASH 5**

**Cavendish**

Tastes like pipe tobacco with some cherry and spice notes. I’ve tried a few recipes with Cavendish and never really loved any of them. Liked, even liked a lot, but never loved. I’ll give it one more chance to WOW me before I toss it, this [Pipe’n Perri](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/266624#pipe_n_perri_by_cubano82) recipe. **TASK 12**

**Chai Spice**

Boldly cardamom forward Chai Spice blend with some softer cinnamon and another spice note I can’t ID behind it, maybe clove, but gentle and blended in. The cardamom tastes a bit vaguely overly citrusy, like there’s a bit of lemony orange in there as well. I’m thinking that citrusy quality might hopefully get covered up in a mix or come across as just a brighter cardamom. Top-heavy flavor, like spice flavors usually are, not a much base to it, perfect for topping things off. Not much to say about it, but it’s not off and it’s very flavorful.  

I’m hesitant to throw it out because I’m working on a papaya chai recipe and might wind up needing it for that. In the meantime, I’ll try:

[Love Letter](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/221668#love_letter_by_rug_ly) Chai Spice Latte. **TASK 13**

[Bishop for Pipe](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/306180#bishop_for_pipe_by_davidn2kl) Spicy tobacco. **TASK 14**

[Masala Chai](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/222155#masala_chai_by_humanpuck). If you’re Indian, it is apparently just like grandma used to make. **TASK 15**

[Spiced Orange Sticky Bun](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/275929#spiced_orange_sticky_bun_by_azzer) I don’t know how I missed this when I was looking for things to do with CAP Sticky Bun, it looks terrific. **TASK 16**

**Cheesecake**

Not the best cheesecake flavor, but a solid one. Just a good plain cheesecake that doesn’t really have anything wrong with it. Slightly sweet, creamy, thick mouthfeel, just enough cheesiness to be a cheesecake without going overboard, has a touch of graham crust, smooth, mixes well. Could stand to be a bit richer but adding some custard or something like that should fix that right up.
I don’t feel like I need to have a bunch of cheesecake flavors, likely making this one dispensable, but want to at least give Develop’s [Pumpkin Cream Cheese Churro](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/172524#pumpkin_cream_cheese_churro_developed_by_developed) a try before I let it go. **TASK 17**

**Cherimoya**

The best I can do when it comes to describing what custard apple flavors - which tend to be pretty interesting and complex - taste like is listing the various fruit notes I get from them. From this one I get pineapple, red apple, pear, coconut, and some mango or maybe papaya. Many of them have a banana note as well, so it’s probably worth noting that I don’t get any banana here.

The tart top notes that are mostly pineapple, mixed with something else, something like red apple, with a softer, sweeter base that’s more vaguely tropical than anything in particular, but kind of like coconut mixed with ripe pear and a bit of some ripe mango or papaya, some kind of orange tropical fruit. Not as thick as other custard apple flavors, as it has a lot more emphasis on that pineapple-apple type flavor up front, but there is a bit of bit body there. It’s just a little bit funky throughout, but that funkiness is more concentrated right after that initial sharp, thinner, more acidic pineapple bite. Base has a sweetness that tastes overtly natural. Lingering sharp pineapple mouthfeel.  

This is not my favorite custard apple. It’s not even my favorite FLV custard apple (FLV Guanabana!), but it’s not a bad flavor, either. It’s good enough that I want to try a couple of fruity messes that make use of it,

[Cherimoya Melange](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/171329#cherimoya_melange_by_echodub) Cherimoya with some interesting accents. **TASK 18**

[Take Me Home](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/250161#take_me_home_by_danielthevapeman). Looks like an apple, peach, and pineapple mix, with cherimoya tying it all together. **TASK 19**

**Cherry Blossom**

100% a floral flavor. It tastes like just the cherry blossoms in cherry blossom tea, the traditional kind that’s just dried cherry blossoms and no actual tea. It’s also a little green and dry, though slightly sweet. Some cherry blossom teas also use actual dried cherries in there with the blossoms, this is not one of those. No cherry. I guess you could say the sweetness in it is a little fruity tasting, but mostly it just happens to come from the same tree as cherries. It’s not a cherry flavor. I think it cries out for creams and maybe some actual tea if you can balance out those drier notes with creams. However, I didn’t see a recipe like that and it doesn't sufficiently motivate me to try to make one. **TRASH 6**

 **Cherry Filling**

This one breaks my heart because there really is a very sweet, bright sort of cherry gummy candy but I get a strong plastic off note along with it, though slightly different than the shower curtain liner flavor, more like the plasticky weirdness of some gummy candy flavors, or something between those two. An odd plastic. Although it’s still pretty terrible, this is quite a bit less offensive at 0.75% than it was when I made the mistake of trying it at 3%, but still with lots of flavor... maybe there’s hope for it at 0.5% or less, but I’m not sticking around to find out. **TRASH 7**

**Chocolate Deutsch**

It’s German Chocolate Cake and if you don’t hate coconut, maybe the best chocolate cake and possibly even the best chocolate thing overall that you’ll ever try. I get that it is not actually a traditional German thing, but German Chocolate Cake is what we call chocolate cake covered in coconut-pecan caramelly goopy custardy frosting in the US and I think in Canada. Anyway, it tastes like rich, dense, saturated dark chocolate cake with a fairly prominent sweet coconut undertone throughout, a touch of caramel, and a lighter nutty flavor. Not at all dry, but not so wet as to be lacking in texture, just rich. I don’t get any off notes at all for German Chocolate Cake, though I can understand the dismay of people who just want a chocolate cake without the coconut. Really nice cakey texture. Some limits to the uses here because it’s so much coconut and chocolate, but it’s a super nice German chocolate cake.

Can’t trash this, I’m right in the middle of trying to use it to make a Chocolate RY4, turns out if you’re just using a little of it for the chocolate, you can cover up the coconut, unless maybe you’re especially sensitive to coconut aroma. I also need it for [Skinny Mint](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/6997#skinny_mint_by_jbird) and my hope of making an even better updated version of the same.

And I need it for Shyndo’s [Mint Chip Cookies and Cream](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/117147#mint_chip_cookies_and_cream_by_shyndo), an old favorite. . **TASK 20**

As long as we’re messin with mint, chocolate, and baked goods, why not [a mint chocolate donut](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/242988#charity_fraud_by_prepaidthemage). **TASK 21**

I’m excited to try this [Tobacco Mint Meltaway](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/205624#tobacco_mint_meltaway_developedflv_by_kurplop), it looks amazing.  **TASK 22**

Apparently I helped with this [Sous Chef](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/209870#sous_chef_by_nowar) recipe. No recollection of doing that, but I feel kind of obliged to try it now. Also, it looks yummy. Another mint chocolate tobacco. **TASK 23**

This one is a little wilder, but Hersherette loved it, and I want to give it a go, too: [SPDR’S WLDST DRMS - A Sifon Story](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/246684#spdr_s_wldst_drms_a_sifon_story_by_spdrjrslm). **TASK 24**

I guess SPDR is a big fan of ze Deutsch, here’s another one that looks like something I don’t want to miss, [Peppermint Ice Cream in a waffle cone](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/254702#wcp_ice_cream_redux_by_spdrjrslm). **TASK 25**

I also need it for this recipe for [Guinness Cake](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/225741#guinness_cake_by_vensyboy) recipe that’s ridiculously good, but this time I’m going to cut the CAP Super Sweet in half, 0.5% is just a little much for it. Thought about subbing an equal amount of FW Sweetener, but sometimes chocolate needs SS. **TASK 26**

Finally, this [Ore’holy Shit](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/227932#ore_holy_shit_by_eyemsam). Double-stuffed raspberry cream Oreo cookie. The Tasty Puff brand is not exactly known for having great flavors, quite the opposite really, most of them suck, but I’m telling you, Tasty Puff Raspberry Cheesecake is Special Good. **TASK 27**

**Cinnamon Crunch**

Super tasty, it pretty much tastes like cinnamon toast crunch cereal, with just a hint of a maple off-note when pushed up too high. Toasty wheat cereal with cinnamon and sugar in and on it. Same great cinnamon as FLV Rich Cinnamon, but nowhere near as potent. About the same level of cinnamon as FLV Apple Filling. It’s not as crunchy and it’s not as cinnamony as real CTC. It’s sweet but not quite as sweet as CTC. But it’s a solid cinnamon toast crunch that can easily be improved if you want CTC. And because it’s not as crunchy as the real deal, it can be versatile. it doesn’t need to only be used for cereal. It can be quite useful in all kinds of bakeries, bread pudding, cobbler, you name it. Anywhere where cinnamon and toasty bready flavor might be desirable.  

I need it to mix my own [Saturday Morning Macaron](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/95350#saturday_morning_macaron_by_id10_t). **TASK 28** I wonder if I could replace that TFA AP with CAP Cereal 27? I’ll think about that while vaping it again.

And this lovely cinnamon toast crunch with heavy cream, [Cinnamon Burn Victim](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/111909#cinnamon_burn_victim_by_chemicalburnvictim). **TASK 29**

I think I might already have trying this [Apple Cinnamon Crunch](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/296249#apple_cinnamon_crunch_by_kittybit) somewhere on my to-do list, but just in case I don’t, **TASK 30** because I don’t want to miss it.

Also, after trying Apple Cinnamon Crunch, I’m going to laugh my ass off if this [Crapple](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/191443#crapple_by_eyemsam) recipe is just as good with half as many ingredients. **TASK 31**

**Cinnamon Roll**

Tastes like a cinnamon roll-flavored candy, or the ghost of a cinnamon roll. Pleasant, but kind of weird. It has a kind of soft bakery cinnamon on top and then just a bit of a very sweet soft, light bakery flavor underneath, but not at all a cinnamon roll. The whole thing is a bit thin and has a smoothness to it rather than a thick and bready textured bakery. It lacks body both in the cinnamon and bread part. No real richness. I wouldn’t have any trouble using it as a cinnamon flavor where a touch of bakery wouldn’t be out of place, but as a cinnamon roll or other cinnamon pastry, no. The roll isn’t really there. No recipes tempt me enough to keep it. **TRASH 8**

**Citrus Soda**

This is a beautiful, damn near magical flavor. It really has that bubbly tickly fizz real carbonated soda. I wish I knew how they did that. My beef with it, if you want to even call it beef and not just an observation, is non-specificity. Does it taste great? Hell yes. Does it taste like Citrus Soda? Hell yes. But does it taste like any specific real-life citrus soda? Not really. It’s like it rides the line between Sprite or 7up and Mountain Dew, and it tastes to me like it has some cotton candy melted into it as well. I’ve never heard anyone else mention cotton candy in it, so maybe that’s just me. Regardless, it’s not just lemon-lime soda. There’s some orangey citrus in there. It’s a non-specific or imaginary citrus soda or amalgamation of various citrus sodas. For a more realistic Sprite or 7up flavor, I’d go with the combination of CAP Lemon Lime and VT Fizzy Sherbet. Or maybe WF Lemon Lime Soda if Sprite/7up is just one part of the flavor and not a central focus, like in a cocktail. For a realistic Mountain Dew, FW Citrus Punch seems like the best or at least easiest route, maybe with some of this or the Fizzy Sherb to enhance it.

It’s in an old favorite, Develop’s Blueberry Champagne, but I just added a fresh batch of that to the to-do list last week. And it’s in another old favorite, [Yoda Soda](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/158275#yoda_soda_by_staybert), that I haven’t had in some time. **TASK 32**

I also need it to make more of one of my new favorites [Zenitsu](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/197324#zenitsu_by_wolfwheeler). **TASK 33**

It’s a bunch of recipes I plan to try already, and it’s about to be in a bunch more.

[Fizzle Wizzle](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/273878#fizzle_wizzle_by_tesladelmar). RASPBERRY LIMEADE! **TASK 34**

And here’s Fizzle Wizzle with the raspberry swapped out for kiwi and that sounds pretty nice, too: [Kiwi Lime Soda](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/293161#kiwi_lime_soda_by_swornoath). **TASK 35**

More kiwi? Yes. More Kiwi. [Green Bertstard Soda](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/212754#green_bertstard_soda_by_spdrjrslm). It’s SPDR week, apparently. Here, he’s taken the delightful Green Bastard recipe and turned it into a whimsical-looking soda. I need to try this. **TASK 36**

More SPDR, this time with a [Paloma](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/216920#sierra_bonita_paloma_del_sol_by_spdrjrslm). **TASK 37**

[3 Day Weekend](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/227600#3_day_weekend_by_rug_ly) Orange cream soda? Sounds pretty good to me. **TASK 38**

So does a [Mango Banana Soda](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/156275#manana_soda_by_staybert) by the soda guy himself, Staybert. **TASK 39**

Here’s a [Mango Soda](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/235817#f_unk_yo_mango_sentinel_by_chumbles), no banana, that looks great, too. **TASK 40**

[Tea-Ki](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/235639#tea_ki_by_diy_discord). SC Black Tea is not my favorite tea, but it looks like a good choice for this mango, passionfruit, citrus summertime recipe. **TASK 41**

Finally, here it is [fizzing up a grape soda](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/197438#barragan_by_wolfwheeler). **TASK 42**

**Classic Cigarette**

Tastes like chewing on a partially smoked cigarette. As horrible as that sounds, it’s been used to create two recipes I absolutely love and am very happy to mix again.

[2 Flavor Banger](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/90634#2_flavor_banger_by_jj_sumbetch). It’s just 1% Classic Cigarette and 1% FA Walnut. **TASK 43**
  
[Chem Twista Lime](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/102517#chem_twista_lime_by_chemicalburnvictim), no joke, cigarette with a pinch of lime, and it’s really cool. **TASK 44**

I want to try this [American Slang](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/66864#american_slang_by_chemicalburnvictim) three-ingredient, 2% total flavor recipe while I’ve got it out. **TASK 45**

**Clove**

My favorite clove, but it needs to be used carefully. 0.5% is as intensely clovey as a clove cigarette. But, I cannot find anything off about it. It’s warm and sweet and full and tastes like cloves. It’s a very deep, rich spice flavor. You might need a dilution for just a slight accent of clove though. It’s seriously strong, like almost but not quite FLV Rich Cinnamon in Clove form. It is a bit dry and kinda woody - perfect for mixing with tobacco and not what I’d call an off-note for clove.

It is my favorite clove mostly because it tastes more realistic and has some depth to it rather than just being straight eugenol, but clove is not one of my favorite things to vape. So I might be tossing it soon, but I want to mix [Dune](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/57961#dune_an_arrakis_remix_by_kindground) again first and make sure I’m not going to miss it too much. **TASK 46**

**Coconut**

Useful ingredient, not a great coconut on its own. Very strong, use low or it starts to both get overpowering and sickeningly rich. Very buttery - so buttery it can probably be used as butter in a mix as effectively as a butter flavor, if not more so. This is fantastic but it’s not really an accurate coconut. It’s not lotion-y, either. It’s more like eating a spoonful of coconut oil straight from the jar, but more buttery. Very good for thickening and enriching other coconut flavors when used carefully. Extremely silky smooth.  

I need it because I know [Deer Lodge](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/90272#deer_lodge_by_concreteriver) just wouldn’t be the same without the 0.25% of it in there. But, I just added Deer Lodge to the to-do list last week. It’s also in another ConcreteRiver favorite of mine, [Feint](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/38680#feint_by_concreteriver). It’s a pina colada swisher! **TASK 47**

I also want to try this [Creamy Vanilla Pudding](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/32622#creamy_vanilla_puddin_by_deejay_mills) that is NOT a coconut recipe. **TASK 48**

**Coffee**

First off, that’s mocha, not just coffee. It’s quite chocolately. Tastes like dark roasted mocha, almost but not quite burnt, not the same kind of burnt popcorn taste some coffee flavors have, more just like slightly burnt coffee. Kind of a burnt bitterness in the top notes.  Gas station mocha that’s been on the burner too long kind of thing. People report coconut as a strong note in this one, I do not get any coconut at 0.25% and it does not taste under flavored at that concentration - it’s really potent. But I do get a feeling like coconut cream. Feels oddly creamy without actually tasting like cream, it’s actually rich, but it’s an odd sort of richness. At 0.5% there’s that coconut, and even more burnt mocha flavor. I just don’t see this working well because it’s burnt and yucky. **TRASH 9**

**Cola**

It tastes like cola that’s a little less flat than others. It has a spicy top note that comes within striking distance of fizzy. It also has a lot more syrupy sweet depth to it, but it’s a little dry. And there is a cherry-ish fruitiness. Not a bad cherry off note, just a cherryish fruit note.

It’s not a bad flavor, in fact I think it might be the best single-flavor cola I’ve tried, but I’m of the mind that if I want to vape cola, I’ll just mix [007 Cola](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/121307#007_cola_by_alfredpudding) and vape that. **TRASH 10**

**Commercial Cigarette**

Yucky ashtray flavor. Even dirtier than Inawera’s Dirty Neutral Base. **TRASH 11**

Character limit got me again, Part 29 will be up in a minute.
