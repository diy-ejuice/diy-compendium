## FLAVORAH

**Macaroon**

Not super authentic for a macaroon (not to be confused with a macaron, which is a way more delicious but difficult to make meringue cookie, or Macron, the president of France), but tasty. FLV Macaroon tastes like toasted coconut and caramel, with a hint of maple, and some buttery and nutty-yet-dry cookie-like flavor. The coconut is fairly light, there’s more caramel than coconut really. So it’s weird and doesn’t quite taste like the name on the bottle, but it doesn’t taste offensive at all, at least to me. But, I’m good without it and feeling like I’m failing at getting rid of flavors on a project called getting rid of flavors, so into the **TRASH 1** it goes.

**Mango**

I know some people get a coconut-like off-note from it, but I don’t. This flavor changed my life. It is literally life-changingly good, in my opinion, because I searched and searched for a really good mango for like a year before this came out. Coconut off note or note, it’s not the perfect mango for every mango situation but it’s damn good. All of the five mango characteristics I was looking for were there. A juicy peach-like body, some pine but not too much, some citrus, some tropical funkyiness, some creamyiness.

The only drawbacks I get with this one is some imbalance and the way it behaves in a mix. It could stand to be a little more ripe - it’s a bit more like a slightly underripe mango not in terms of having too much piney flavor, but in not having more of that ripe tropical funk. Instead it’s heavy on the peachy aspect, making it almost more of a single flavor mango-peach combo. It could also stand to have a little more of that odd creamy feel, it’s barely there at all, making it read especially at lower % like more of a mango nectar than fruit or fruit juice. As far as the way it behaves, it tends to sit right on top of a mix without some emulsifying help, but that’s not always a bad thing, for example, Shydo’s Mango Sticky Rice uses that as a feature rather than a bug.

This is an older flavor, and up against VT Shisha Mango, FA Indian Mango, and FLV Sweet and Ripe Mangoes, I don’t feel like this would be go-to mango anymore. But I still need it for so many recipes (at least until I remix some of them) and some more I want to try. Some of these I might skip once I get down this far, if I feel like I’ve already mixed them recently enough (favorites) or if something I taste between now and then changes my mind about them. In the meantime, this is going to be a long list.

Need it for [Abuela](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/47894#abuela_by_fear) **TASK 1**

[Mango Blossom Macaron](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/46330#mango_blossom_macaron_by_id10_t). Already planning to mix a version with a bit more FA Almond, but either I mix that one or the original, it’s time for some more. I’m pretty sure this is the best recipe I’ve ever created. **TASK 2**

And another, less serious Mango-Honeysuckle recipe: (Commodore Mango](<https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/199249#commodore_mango_by_id10_t>). Gonna try adding 0.25% WS-23 this time. **TASK 3**

And it looks like that inspired something potentially amazing: [The Commodore’s Mangoecean Water](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/215540#the_commodore_s_mangocean_water_by_spdrjrslm). **TASK 4**

And another, even less serious Mango-Honeysuckle recipe: [Suckle My Manly Strap-On](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/34464) **TASK 5**

And yet another, (not my recipe): [1-2-3 ID10-T](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/90215#1_2_3_id10t_theyearinmixing_by_deweysuds) that should probably try. **TASK 6**

[Mango Colada](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/12259#mango_colada_by_id10_t). Making an updated version without CAP Golden Pineapple is on the agenda, but I think I still planned to use FLV Mango in it. One version or another, **TASK 7**

[Spicy Ice Chamoyada Mangonada](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/116249#spicy_icy_chamoyada_mangonada_by_id10_t), or an updated version of the same, without CAP Sweet Mango and possibly with other changes **TASK 8**

[Mango Beauregarde](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/39457#mango_beauregarde_by_kopel) is fantastic but was put on the list recently. It inspired me to create this [Paradise Cream](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/169041). It’s time that recipe got a facelift. I’m going to try this:

Paradise Cream ‘23, V1 **TASK 9**

| Co. | Flavor            | %   |
| --- | ----------------- | --- |
| FLV | Mango             | 3   |
| FLV | Sweet Mango       | 0.5 |
| FA  | Violet            | 2   |
| FLV | Cream             | 1   |
| WF  | Vanilla Ice Cream | 3   |
| TFA | Vanilla Swirl     | 2   |
| SSA | Ice Cream Vanilla | 1   |

Ok, so that’s purple mango and purple mango ice cream. Better try [Blue Mango](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/271992#blue_dream_blue_mango_by_danielthevapeman) while I’m at it. Gonna steep it for 7 days, not 420. Silly Daniel. **TASK 10**

[Mango Papaya Candy](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/48055#mango_papaya_candy_by_bradh). RIght up my tropical alley. **TASK 11**

[Dismal Pie](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/182070#dismal_pie_by_dragonlady) is a favorite that was added to the mix list recently. But here’s another FLV Mango and VT Paw Paw recipe that looks great: [Paw-Paw Pudding](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/207295#paw_paw_puddin_by_rogueislander). **TASK 12**

[1-2-3 Apple Mango](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/174063#1_2_3_apple_mango_by_rushg93). Looks simply delicious **TASK 13**

[1-2-3 Mango Sprite](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/171846#1_2_3_mango_sprite_by_rushg93). **TASK 14** and definitely going to be thinking about how to augment that.

[Grango 1-2-3](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/125500#grango_1_2_3_by_alfredpudding). Why not? **TASK 15**

[Mana Coco](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/217537#mana_coco_by_leah_fc), mango, banana, and coconut. Yes please. **TASK 16**

And just one more bit of [Mango Madness](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/298524#mango_madness_by_badboxer99) to finish it off. **TASK 17**

**Mango Pineapple Passion**

This is tasty and really tastes like all three of the things, in a very balanced way. It’s as if they just took whatever the right amounts of FLV Mango, FLV Passion Fruit, and FLV Pineapple were needed to make them work together and mixed them into one bottle. Like an orangey yellow fruit punch. Which is great, I guess, though if I wanted to I could do that myself.

FLV Mango Passion Pineapple has a quite present mango that’s not too piney or funky, pineapple that’s sweet and not too sharp. Passionfruit tastes is present but a little on the lemony side and the tartness is present, but not really getting that nectary depth of like sweet passionfruit nectar or syrup. Overall it’s fairly juicy, not really fleshy or super thick, like mixing the juice of each of these fruits together. It’s a little top heavy. Like an orangey yellow fruit punch.

It really doesn’t inspire a ton of creativity for me, since it’s already got so much going on it tastes kind of one-shotty. I don’t know what to do with this other than maybe add another of whatever I’d like to highlight, or add another tropical flavor to it like Guanabana, Banana, Coconut. Something with some base. Or maybe throw some cream at it and make a tropical smoothie, or some rum and make it like a Caribbean vacation vape.

Here’s one where someone accentuated the mango and passionfruit and kinda hung pineapple out to dry, and it looks like something I’d love to vape: [Mango Passion](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/233176#mango_passion_by_yummykevin98) **TASK 18**

I bet this [Summer Wedding](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/228359#summer_wedding_by_mindfloodz) that has a lot in common with the aforementioned recipe island is probably amazing. **TASK 19**

I’m missing the Sugar Daddy for this [1-2-3 VIC with Mango and Passionfruit Topping](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/222834#1_2_3_vic_with_mango_and_passion_fruit_topping_by_samharborne) and while I love the idea, it looks like too much fruit. I’m going to mix it but just leave out the sweetener and cut all three fruits in half, as suggested by one of the two people who’ve reviewed it so far. **TASK 20**

**Maple Bar**

It definitely tastes like the frosting on a maple bar donut. There isn’t much bar there. It’s there, but it’s a light flavor that doesn’t have a lot of body, just slight donutty bakery notes. This seems like a job for WF Sweet Bread to me. Maybe a touch of that WF Glazed Donut as well. The donut part is light enough that it does give it some versatility though, I think it could do for a maple glaze on top of anything baked, not just a maple bar donut. Like if you loaded it up with cookie flavors you could get a good maple glaze for a maple glazed cookie out of it... and now that’s a thing I want. A maple-frosted sugar cookie vape.

I took a good look at 3 recipes, [Maple Nut Goodies](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/103512#maple_nut_goodies_by_mlnikon), [mlNikon’s Maple Bar](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/164417#mlnikon_s_maple_bar_by_mixinvixens), and [Cookie Maple Bar Sundae](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/179814#cookie_maple_bar_sundae_by_besejuiced) and while all three look pretty good, I think I can do them better. Hubris? Maybe. We’ll see.

**Marshmallow**

I remember liking this a lot more when it was new, years ago, but now that I’ve tried it again... I guess I just didn't have as much to compare it to back then. It was the best marshmallow I had at the time. And it’s good, but it’s not like the most super awesome thing ever. Even FLV has a better marshmallow now. This one is very sweet, full, thick, a little dry, and has a light powdery finish, but with some almost-richness to it in the middle. Bright-ish almost-but-not-quite floral vanilla, I think that’s the main thing I didn’t notice before, the vanilla is just a little sharper than it should be, even after steeping for week, which you should absolutely do with this one, because it really fills out and gets smoother and sweeter over time.

I need it for my [Lucky’s Charms](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/99041#lucky_s_charms_by_id10_t) and [Holy Peepus](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/92939#holy_peepus_yearofmixing_by_id10_t) recipes but already have plans to update those that may or may not wind up using it. **TASK 24** and **TASK 25** are to mix whatever versions I’m on of those. Gotta move that along.

I also need it to try Tobacco Mint Meltaway (already on list and excited about) and maybe one or two others already in the queue. Adding one more, [CCCP](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/13117#cccp_by_bcrunk), that looks like a coconut and custard lover’s dream come true. **TASK 26**

**Marshmallow Treat**

This is more trick than treat. I’m assuming it’s supposed to be a rice crispy treat which is just marshmallow, butter, and rice krispies cereal but it doesn’t really taste like any of those things. There’s something sticky sweet and vaguely marshmallow-ish in there, but it’s mostly this malty mess of disjointed notes. Besides the malt and sticky sweetness, I get dry cardboard pretty clearly and then this weird and a swampy stewed berry-like fruitiness maybe combined with some sort of funky nut. It’s not what it’s supposed to be and it’s just not very good, either. **TRASH 2**

**Marshmallow Vanilla**

This is a really great, authentic marshmallow. Very thick and full but also kind of airy, not crisp like a cereal marshmallow, not really heavy. Vanilla is well-blended into the marshmallow, The vanilla doesn’t sit right on top like a lot of marshmallows, and even though it’s in the name, it’s a fairly light, very natural vanilla. No off notes. Has a powdery finish like an actual marshmallow, almost like a homemade marshmallow coated with a mix of cornstarch and powdered sugar. One thing I have noticed with this marshmallow is that it has the ability to really stand out in a mix. It can really make something marshmallow flavored. It’s probably not really the best for use as an additive type of thing. Truly the closest flavor I’ve tried to a real homemade marshmallow, which if you’ve never had one, is so much better than the mass-produced stuff in plastic bags at the grocery store.

I need it for [Vanilla Rose Custard](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/141736#vanilla_rose_custard_by_jazzy_girl), which is delightful AF, especially if you love vanilla custard vapes but are getting just a little bored with them overall. **TASK 27**

Might wind up using this in updating a couple of old recipes. In the meantime, it’s in several things I already planned to mix, such as [Jersey Caramel](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/271146#jersey_caramel_by_diydownunderpippa).

Adding:

[Lucky Cookie](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/255445#lucky_cookie_by_nowar) as I’m pretty much required to do. **TASK 28**

[Dat Pud](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/141014#dat_pud_by_sixstrings952). Wanna see what that white chocolate does in there. **TASK 29**

[Cocoliconut Cream Pie](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/234051#cocoliconut_cream_pie_by_spdrjrslm). That’s right, coconut cream pie with licorice. Reviews talked me into it. **TASK 30**

[Nakatomi Nutter](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/250335#nakatomi_nutter_by_spdrjrslm). PB + Marshmallow fluff sandwich. **TASK 31**

[Little Hulkster](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/213135#little_hulkster_by_mindfloodz). Stop sleeping on SSA Multivitamin! **TASK 32**

**Melon Rind**

Tastes a lot like cucumber. Which makes sense, the best part of a cucumber tastes just like the worst part of a watermelon. It’s sweeter than cucumber but has that same crisp green vegetal note. Has a lot of body and the sweetness reminds me of that watermelon gum that has a bit of that that candy rind note, but this would be just the candy rind note without the rest of the watermelon. Which tastes awfully cucumbery. There’s some melon there, similar to a honeydew melon, but mostly just that cucumber flavor. There are a ton of cucumber melon recipes - this is almost a cucumber melon one-shot. I might use it to make Watermelon Bubblicious out of a candy watermelon, or maybe a bridge type ingredient in a cucumber/honeydew melon situation, or not try to mimic anything and instead just explore pairing it with things lime and mint that go well with cucumber or honeydew. Thick, not super juicy, but certainly moist. Thicker, sweeter, and more melony at first; ends on a crisper cucumber note.

So, I’m tempted to toss it, but I used to make a drink (because the girls loved it) that was Sprite, Midori, and Coconut Rum. I want to see if I can make a vape version of that, and I think Melon Rind might be key in making the Midori part work. Credit to [this recipe](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/142441#sweet_and_sassy_irish_lassie_midori_melon_ball_cocktail_all_flv_by_mech_mod_rn) for giving me that idea.

Poison Ivy, V1 **TASK 33**

| Co. | Flavor        | %    |
| --- | ------------- | ---- |
| FLV | Honeydew      | 2    |
| FLV | Melon Rind    | 0.75 |
| FLV | Wild Melon    | 1.5  |
| CAP | Lemon Lime    | 3    |
| VT  | Fizzy Sherbet | 2    |
| FLV | Citrus Soda   | 1.5  |
| WF  | Coconut Rum   | 3    |
| VT  | Light Rum     | 1    |
| FA  | Polar Blast   | 0.5  |

I'm going to try using Polar Blast for cooling instead of WS-23 because WS-23 can get weird with VT Light Rum.

I tried this once, long, long, long ago, when I only had FA, TFA, and CAP flavors to work with (and didn't really know what I was doing at all). The result tasted like a neoprene bicycle seat cover that had been ridden by someone with an ass crack full of coconut tanning oil. If this is anywhere near that bad/doesn’t seem worth continuing to tinker with, FLV Melon Rind is a goner.

**Mild Tobacco**

I found this flavor to need a steep of between 1 and 2 weeks. Otherwise, at 2% I get an odd chemical note which I don’t like even at 1 week. Hard to describe but somewhat similar to ammonia. I get the same thing from most Inawera tobaccos before they steep.

Bummer since I’m used to being spoiled by FLV shake and vapeable tobaccos and only get that weird taste from a couple of the cigarette-styled ones when they aren't steeped. But never from the darker ones like Red Burley and Kentucky.

At two weeks, I got a really prominent sweetness, like a brown sugary almost maple sweetness. I know some tobacco heads will balk “too sweet” but I love it, just a wonderful dark brown sugary maple-ish flavor on top of a mild and light but true tobacco. Very nice.

Already planning to try [A Dirty Cookie](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/229393#no_you_re_a_dirty_cookie_by_eyemsam), but there are more great-looking recipes that use this.

Such as:

[The Bacco You Want](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/231622#the_bacco_you_want_by_chainvapor). Looks nutty. **TASK 34**

[Butterfly Sperm](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/272292#butteryfly_sperm_by_danielthevapeman). Looks nutty in a different sense of the word. **TASK 35**

**Milk**

It ain’t no FA Milk, but it ain’t too bad, neither. Kinda tastes like half-and-half that’s right at the expiration date but not over it, IIRC. Also a slight nutty (not bad) off-note. Compared to how foul some other milk flavors are, that’s not too shabby. I enjoyed it in [Rin’s Unicorn Milk](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/193461#rin_s_unicorn_drink_by_mixinvixens) but not quite enough to put that one in the must-mix-again category. I’m going to let this one go. It just doesn’t hold up against options like FA Milk, One-on-One Cream (Milky Undertones), and various cream and sweet cream flavors. **TRASH 3**

**Milk & Honey**

I freakin love the stuff. But am I the only one who doesn’t think it tastes like honey? Like at all? Yes there’s this darker than sugar sweet sweetness in there which is what honey is but I feel like if they called it cream and caramel or butterscotch brown sugar milk or dulce de leche people would be saying it tastes like those things. I keep seeing it described as honey in people’s flavor notes and questioning whether I’m broken or something because to me, it does not taste like honey at all. It doesn’t really taste like milk, either, although there is a heavy cream element.

I’m not sure it is even supposed to actually taste like honey and milk. I think the name is just a reference to a Bible phrase about the “land of milk and honey,” which is a metaphoric way of describing a place of unimaginable richness. At least I hope it’s a metaphor. Otherwise it would be a pretty sticky and smelly place.

That seems to make more sense than literal milk and honey for the flavor, too. It tastes like richness. It’s like some kind of sweetened extra heavy cream or egg-free pudding, with a dark caramel-like sweetness, with a bit of sweet toasted bakery in there that kind of reminds me of a bit of an eggo waffle or maybe a waffle cone, and a very light hint of something a little chocolately. Would be extremely similar to a dulce de leche if it weren’t for the little toasty bakery edge. Beautiful mouthfeel and great addition to all kinds of stuff.

I need it for [Golden Snozzberry Custard](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/155578#golden_snozzberry_custard_by_diy_discord). I still can’t believe this was created by a group of people in like 30 minutes. It tastes like it was crafted carefully over many failed versions to get it right. **TASK 36**

FLV M&H is a flavor I also need for a bunch of recipes on the really long list of things to try. I’m just going to add a few more today. I know there are others that I’ll pick up when considering other flavors.

[SICK AF](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/22099#sick_af_by_matthewkocanda). Just two great ingredients mixed together. **TASK 37** Edit: Will also try a version that's just OG SICK AF plus 2% FLV Mild Tobacco as recommended by isuamadog, but I'm gonna steep that for two weeks before I try it. **TASK 37.5**

[Peanut Cream](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/177214#peanut_cream_by_spycke). Looks like a no-bullshit creamy peanut butter. **TASK 38**

[Edward](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/207000#edward_by_wolfwheeler). I love pistachio pudding. This better not disappoint! **TASK 39**

[Calipitter Sperm](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/267212#calipitter_sperm_by_danielthevapeman). I’m gonna need Daniel to stop with the bodily fluid-based names, but that looks amazing. **TASK 40**

[Land of Cream and Honey](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/114263#land_of_cream_and_honey_by_marnu). Looks simply delicious, as long as that 0.25% FA Honey isn’t too much. I don’t think it will be, but actual honey flavor (not FLV Milk & Honey) can be tricky. **TASK 41**

**Milk Chocolate**

Very potent, such that 0.25% can be enough to overtake a mix. I don’t understand what people are doing using it over 1%, unless maybe Frankenstiening. It mostly tastes like Hershey’s syrup, which is like, definitely not the same as good milk chocolate, but not quite a tootsie roll, either. The best luck I’ve had with this one is using it like a chocolaty coating. Like a dipped cone from DQ? Where the ice cream cone is dipped in that warm liquid chocolatey stuff that hardens into a chocolate shell over the ice cream? Like that.

Still planning to probably use it when I finish my update of my chocolate RY4 recipe, still need it for my Brookside Blues’ brother recipe, also need it for the So-Ho-Ho-Ho on the list. Must add to that: [Samoas](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/233937#samoas_by_spdrjrslm). Former Girl Scout approved, says the review by hesherette. **TASK 42**

**Mint Candy**

I honestly can’t tell you 100% what type of mint (peppermint, spearmint, mixed mint) this is supposed to be. Seems to lean a little more peppermint, though. A little menthol like naturally occurs in mint leaves, right? But a lot of flavors exaggerate that and have extra menthol. This one seems to go off in the other direction, with very little of that menthol-type cooling upfront. It’s got a lot of sticky sweet, thick body without going full hard candy or chewing gum, almost like a mint jelly but not quite. Except that mint jelly should be clearly spearmint, and I’m not getting that. Maybe mixed mint jelly candy? Some kind of hippy mint jelly drop candy? Maybe I’m just not thinking creatively enough, but even though it tastes perfectly fine, a great use for this doesn’t really come to mind. It might be a great “mint for people who hate menthol” though.

I’ve yet to try a recipe using it, time to change that, starting with a couple different versions of mint-vanilla creams:

[Frost Punk Revisited](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/219714#frost_punk_revisited_by_kittybit). Just that little bit of FLV Peppermint in there makes it look great to me. **TASK 43**

[Pillowy Mints](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/227115#pillowy_mints_by_queenbb). I don’t know whether the very low %s were gonna work for me but neither did one of the reviewers until he tried it. I don’t know that I’d like a mint recipe where FLV Mint Candy is the only mint, but seeing the FW Creme de Menthe in there is reassuring. **TASK 44**

And here’s another with FW Creme de Menthe in there, but it’s not a vanilla mint cream, it’s.... Something else. [White Licorice](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/297889#white_licorice_by_jakinbox). **TASK 45**

**Mocha**

**TRASH 4** Weird nasty bitter burnt coffee note on top of a sweeter, kind of dark chocolatey base, dry, a little harsh.

**Morning Mimosa**

It ain’t no VT Blood Orange Champagne, but it ain’t too bad, neither. I like this, and I have really enjoyed some recipes that were made with it, but there’s a reason why someone, who I think might have been Rick, called it “Prison Wine” and that nickname kinda stuck. It’s a bit separated between the champagne and orange and the orange is a little off-puttingly overripe. There’s some zesty orange upfront, then it sweetens and smooths out into a decent enough orange juice, but fermented. The champagne is a bit funky, but identifiable as champagne. Has a decent bubblish effect.

I doubt there’ll ever be a better use for this than [Grunch](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/162546#grunch_by_kopel), but I want to try mixing some things.

I really liked this [1-2-3 Poinsettia](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/124973#1_2_3_poinsettia_by_hibbadoray) and I created this [1-2-3 Sparkling Mimosa](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/90487#1_2_3_sparkling_mimosa_by_id10_t) that I think was good enough to share but obviously not Grunch-level good. What if I were to use [Berts Soda Base](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/156816#berts_soda_base_by_staybert) to turn them into Poinsettia and Mimosa spritzers?

**Moscoto**

Very sweet, thick, deep white grape, but a tish floral. Sticky sweet, but natural, not candy white grape. Better white grape than the white grape flavors I’ve tried. Not really wine, not boozy. Tastes a little like lychee or peach in the background, or at least has that same kind of floral lurking in there. Be careful with it. Use too much and that floral really comes out to the point it tastes like you filtered your juice through dryer sheets.

If you have FLV Moscoto and want to find a use for it, I highly recommend [Layerz - Moscato Nectar](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/141094#layerz_moscato_nectar_by_deetzz). But, there isn’t anything else I want to mix with it, and I want to end a week of mostly failing to get rid of flavors by actually getting rid of a flavor. Instead of keeping it just to make more of that, I’m going to let Moscoto go. **TRASH 5**
