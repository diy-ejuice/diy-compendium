TASK OR TRASH - Each flavor gets assigned at least one task or it goes in the trash.

## FLAVOUR ART

**Violet**

Yup, that's violet. It tastes very, very violet, without being perfumy. It's sweet, too, with some chalky sweetness especially in the finish, like a violet candy. It will get a little laundry-soapish with too much, so start low, but it will turn anything floral-purple long before that happens. I don't get anything I would call an off-note from this.

I need it to make more [Mango Beauregarde](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/39457-mango_beauregarde) **TASK 1**, to make a modernized remix of my old Paradise Cream recipe, and because I want to try Violet Hops, and Jazz Hands (while I still have some Holy Vanilla). There really isn't much else I want to mix that uses it.

**Waffles Vanilla**

That is certainly a waffle. There's a hint of vanilla baked in but I don't know that it really warrants having vanilla in the name, it's just a touch. It's a bit doughy like it's undercooked but considering how bad some other waffle flavors are, this is definitely one of the better ones. Although it tastes undercookied and doughy in the center and is overall a creamy feeling flavor, it has the nice crispy edges of a waffle. It is a bit nutty if I think about it too hard, around the edges, but I didn't take hit and immediately go “nuts.” Since the OG INW Waffle is now long gone, I think this is probably my favorite waffle flavor. There isn't really anything I want (or am able) to mix that uses it, so I'll just start simple with an attempt at a waffle with butter and maple syrup.

Justwaffle V1 **TASK 2**

| Co. | Flavor          | %   |
| --- | --------------- | --- |
| FA  | Waffles Vanilla | 2   |
| FA  | Maple Syrup     | 1.5 |
| VT  | Butter Base     | 1   |
| VT  | Golden Syrup    | 1   |

**Walnut**

Walnut milk? Walnut water? I don't know, but this flavor is wet. Juicy. Or at least, very moist compared to other nuts. I think that throws the accuracy off quite a bit, but it's a little more walnutty than WF Walnut. It has that earthy, somewhat sharp top note that I expected from a walnut right up front, but a sweeter, much less distinct nutty thick body that also throws it off of walnut a ways. The whole thing was oddly wet. Could be very useful to combat the dryness that is so ubiquitous with nuts, without being tempted to do something gross like add cactus to them.

I'll mix some more [2 Flavor Banger](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/90634-2_flavor_banger) with twice as much nicotine as I usually use, perfect for when there's an open bar. **TASK 3**

**Watermelon (Red Summer)**

Sort of like a very authentic watermelon, but not, because it's so dry. I mean, wetness is like a watermelon's most defining characteristic. It's got water right there in the name. This is like freeze-dried astronaut watermelon. It's also thin and just sort of has that natural watermelon top note minus all wetness and some of the sweetness that makes a watermelon a watermelon. It's not a bad flavor, but it needs a lot of help.

I have a handful of recipes already in the queue that use this one. Of course I will not be tossing one of the components to the original Strap-On and several variations that I've already planned to try and/or try again. One that hasn't been put on the list yet but will be there now: [Fuzzy Strap-On](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/34851-fuzzy_strapon). **TASK 4**

**Whipped Cream**

This is my #2 Whipped Cream (OoO is #1). It's very milky, it manages to very clearly be a dairy product without tasting remotely rancid, like homemade whipped cream. Very full and satisfying, with a lingering milkfat feel like whipped cream. Just a touch of vanilla. It's a somewhat soft and subtle flavor, lending it an airy, fluffy feel, but not at all drying.

Already picked out at least four recipes that use it, here's a couple more.

[Kahlua Coffee](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/271374-_kahlua_coffee_) - SSA Tiramisu. If you've tried it, you know. **TASK 5**

[hard furry creamy](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/262433-hard_furry_creamy). This one is rated TV MA for coconut violence, but I think I can handle it. **TASK 6**

**Whisky**

Cheap scotch with a big splash of apple juice and a cherry in it. I guess it kind of tastes like whisky. Has a little boozy bite there. It has some peat moss in it that makes it tastes a little bit like cheap scotch but, with a weird and fairly prominent fruity sweetness, somewhere between an apple and a cherry.

I have to keep this (for now) to try Kopel's Fireside recipe again, so I'll keep it a little longer than than to try his [Castle Longer](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/135987-castle_longer) as well. **TASK 7**

**White Grape**

Eating freeze-dried white grapes while wearing a little too much perfume. Very jammy sticky sweet and mostly tastes like white grapes, but vapes pretty dry, or at least not wet and juicy like a grape or grape juice. Maybe needs to be fixed with just a little cactus? But, not sure about that because it already packs quite a floral wallop and cactus might amplify that. There's a little tart tannic grape skin note that's appropriate but that musky and slightly bitter floral right on top is unfortunate. I'd use this maybe in a small dose to try to make a “purple” flavor taste a little more like a real grape, as well as add that nice jammy sweetness to it, but not for anything else. Almost certainly not as the main flavor in a mix.

Nothing that uses this is something I want to try, and it's about time I threw something away this week. **TRASH 1**

**White Peach**

It really very accurately, almost freakishly, emulates the difference between a classic yellow peach and a sweeter, sugary white peach. However, it's a little thin, and a little dry, and I get some throat irritation from it. Gets a bit too sharp and floral if taken up too high, and can overtake a mix while still not being especially bold.

Although it can be a little tricky to work with, this is one of the greatest peach flavors by comparison.

I need it for one of my all-time favorites, [Blue Eyes White Dragon](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/124392-blue_eyes_white_dragon) **TASK 8**

I've already picked out about eight recipes that make use of it, including two I hope to find time to mix up today. I'll also try [Yet Another Peaches and Cream](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/160459-yet_another_peaches_and_cream) - just four flavors that look great together. **TASK 9**

**Wine Champagne**

Careful with this one. I tried 3-4% shake and vape because my 2% steeped sample was fairly weak and was weird, like rotten grapes. Possibly this just needs to stay a soft, background-type flavor. 2% is not rotten, just fermented. Isn't fizzy. It's more like white wine than champagne. Sweet-tart, almost but not quite vinegary tartness. It tastes even more like white wine than FA White Wine, which is more of a brighter white grape flavor, and a good one at that. This tastes too fermented to just be a white grape juice flavor, it's definitely wine. Kinda gross as a single flavor, but seems like it could make a nice base for any kind of fruit wine and I've tried a recipe with watermelon where it did exactly that very well.

[Old Dogs, Children and Watermelon Wine](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/53825-old_dogs_children_and_watermelon_wine) was the aforementioned recipe. I liked it very much when I tried it years ago, will give it another shot. **TASK 10** It's also in a Mango Champagne recipe I've already planned to try.

**Wine White**

Somewhere around halfway between a semi-sweet white table wine and white grape juice. Not floral at all. A little fermentedish, but not really boozy. Smooth. Lightly sweet. Not especially thin, more thick-ish. Not dry, actually slightly juicy. Really nothing to complain about here. Fairly light flavor at 1.5%, tastes like it could easily go higher % especially if it is to be the main flavor in a mix. Could easily pass for a bit of white grape flavor in a mix. Better than FA White Grape (that one's too floral as well as a bit dry).

It's not a bad flavor, but I can't find a recipe I want to mix that uses it, and don't feel inspired to create one. **TRASH 2**

**Wow**

Sort of tastes like a donut but more of a generic pastry, wrapped around a little bit of fruit that tastes distinctly red but not on point for any particular red fruit such as raspberry or strawberry. Sweet and complex, but also dry and thin, not a thick and rich pastry or especially gooey filling. Also, very slightly harsh. Maybe you could use it to build a fruit-filled donut, but both the donut part and the filling part will need a lot of help, and at that point it's sort of a why bother type of situation unless maybe it's a bridge-type of flavor, but arguably that's not even something you'd want or need if you're trying to get any separation between pastry and fruit layers.

I've planned to try [Bite Me](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/130699-bite_me) already because it looks fantastic, but had trouble finding anything else I really want to use WoW for. I guess I'll try this [Freak Show](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/230628-freak_show) recipe, **TASK 11**, but I'm not super excited about it like I am for most of the recipes I link.

**Ylang Ylang**

I don't think I've ever tried this. I'll mix a sample at 0.75%. **TASK 12**

**Yogurt**

**TRASH 3** Trash, with prejudice. One of the top 10 worst flavors I have ever tried. It tastes like a company of athlete's foot-suffering soldiers marching through a swamp of Miracle Whip, except that that would be very wet and squishy and this is dry and chalky. Aftertaste like I barfed an hour ago and it came out my nose and I still have a case of the stinky burnies. Worst of all, this abomination is a reformulation of a delicious FA Yogurt flavor that is no longer sold.

**Zen Garden**

Dry sweet basil with some dry sage in the background. Very Dry. Has a slight woody quality.

Keeping it to try [Coconut Thai Remixed](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/48929-coconut_thai_remixed). I couldn't find another recipe that I want to mix, but this one for [Gin Blossom](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/14898-gin_blossom) by CheebaSteeba has interesting elements and I want to see what just this one small piece of a the recipe tastes like.

Zen Suckle V1 **TASK 13**

| Co. | Flavor      | %    |
| --- | ----------- | ---- |
| TFA | Honeysuckle | 2.5  |
| FA  | Aurora      | 1    |
| FA  | Zen Garden  | 0.75 |

**Zeppola**

It's like you sprinkled a little spice blend on one of those powered sugar donuts to try to make it taste fancy. A cake donut with powdered sugar and an indistinct spice note like light nutmeg/cinnamon/maybe clove note. Indistinct warm spice note is not as prominent as it is in WF Deep Fried Pastry Dough but is quite present. Very sweet, dense, possibly fried (slightly oily mouthfeel but not a lot of greasy taste), not yeasty, cake donut because cake donuts get their rise from baking powder rather than yeast and there is no yeast here. A little dry. Lots of powdered sugar on top and in the finish, almost a sugar lips effect. People say the main or only problem with Zeppola is that it sticks out in a mix and they know when it's in there… I think that's more due to the spice note than any other defining characteristic. It's a shame that's in there because it would be so much better without it, but I know from recipes Zeppola can be a useful tool, even if it's unfortunately not the Holy Donut Grail.

Most recipes that appear to pretend that weird spice note isn't there or can be covered with just fruit donut really interest me at all, but if there is another spice added that probably covers it up/pulls it in a given direction, that's another story.
[Cinnayum](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/229230-c_i_n_n_a_y_u_m) is one that I already plan to try, because it looks amazing.

Also:

On the subject of cinnamon rolls, [Banana Cinnamon Rolls](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/247707-banana_cinnamon_rolls%F0%9F%8D%8C). **TASK 14**

[Gooey Apple Pie](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/289797-gooey_apple_pie) - as long as 1% FLV Apple Filling is enough to make it just take like cinnamon and not that odd Zeppola spice, everything else here looks great. **TASK 15**

[Double Glazed Apple Fritter](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/213016-double_glazed_apple_fritter), 1% WF Deep Fried Pastry Dough is sure to make it fritter-ish, but it looks like doubling down on odd spice blend. Hoping 1.2% Apple Filling saves this one. **TASK 16**

**Note**

Didn't get rid of many flavors or give any updates this week, but I said I was going to get through the rest of FA and I've done that. Next week, I'll dive into German Flavours. Definitely a bunch of trash there.

**Note about the subreddit shutting down on Monday**

When (if?) it comes back up, I'll resume posting these here. In the meantime, I'll continue posting them to [my own profile](https://www.reddit.com/user/ID10-T/), where I've already copy-pasted the first 46 installments. If someone has a better idea for where GRoMoMF can best trudge forward with or without Reddit, I'd be very happy to hear it.
