#Hangsen

**DE Tobacco**

Don’t believe I’ve tried this one, will see what 3% tastes like. **TASK 1**

**Deluxe Tobacco**

Dirty, rich, dark, very sweet, a little toasty. I’ve seen couple of reviews talking about fruits in there, I get zero fruit, not even a hint of fruit. It reminds me of something like TFA RY4 Double and Soho. Soho because it’s a little toasty, but RY4 because it’s mostly sweet and a little dirty, with nothing I’d really call tobacco. It’s a darker dirty but it’s still just dirty. The sweetness is darker too, almost molassesy, but without that bittery molasses bite. Like dirty Karo Dark corn syrup. I would definitely use it to sweeten a tobacco blend if I didn’t have anything else to use for that, but I do, and I can’t find anything I want to make out of this. **TRASH 1**

**Desert Ship**

Dry, spicy, light tobacco. Spice is unique, not that same warm, autumn-type spice as the other Desert Ship flavors. Hard to pick individual spice notes apart but tastes like very mild spicy (not licorice) anise, a touch of something with an herbal quality like sassafras, a touch of vanilla bean, maybe some cardamom. Smooth, especially considering the dryness. Some plum-like fruitiness. Some caramelly sweetness and a very noticeable nuttiness to the tobacco. More like a cigarette tobacco than pipe or cigar, specifically more like a Camel, but not spot-on. No ashiness or smokeyness. Seems like a tobacco flavor that could be used for all kinds of things.

I’m really surprised there aren’t more recipes out there using HS Desert Ship. I need it for [Chem Twista Lime](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/102517-chem_twista_lime), an old favorite. This [Virginia Ship](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/217251-virginia_ship) recipe looks excellent, too. **TASK 2**

**DJ Rum**

This is not a rum flavor. It is a clove tobacco. Which makes perfect sense if you think about it for a second. I’m too mad at it for not being rum to keep it. **TRASH 2**

**French Vanilla Icecream**

HS FVIC works wonders in some recipes for the way it fills in cream profiles, I’ve used it many times for that. But it’s not really a very good ice cream by itself. It doesn’t have a whole lot of vanilla for a vanilla ice cream flavor. Some really malty vanilla but not nearly enough for vanilla ice cream. It’s just like a bottle of extremely thick and basey buttery dairy richness with a bit of malty vanilla.

HS French Vanilla Ice Cream’s butter aspect starts to taste a little too movie theaterish to me at 2%, but it works well below that for more buttery richness and depth to an ice cream or other cream profile. Even if you don’t mind that or don’t think the butter tastes weird, you’re still going to want to use with caution because that malty aspect gets a little weird in a nutty kind of way at 2% as well for me, probably lower for some folks,, and that weird nutty maltiness with easily get out of hand in a recipe. It shows up. Keep it around 1 to 1.5%, or even lower.

I’m keeping this, but SSA Vanilla Ice Cream mostly does what this does, only better. SSA Vanilla Ice Cream makes me not think about using HS FVIC as much anymore. For now, I need it for one of my all-time favorite recipes, [Notorious](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/37519-notorious). But I wonder whether SSA Vanilla Ice Cream might work as a substitute/possible improvement, so I’ll try mixing it with that as a 1:1 sub. **TASK 3**

I left a four-star review for [It’s a Guava Thing](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/132214-its_a_guava_thing), but the recipe has since been updated and I want to try the new-and-improved version. **TASK 4**

Also, a few newer recipes that use it and look too good to pass up:

[RY O RY](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/269360-ry_o_ry), a four-ingredient Ruyan vanilla cream that looks expertly crafted. **TASK 5**

And two bourbon custards, a simpler one: [Bourbon Custard](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/234611-bourbon_custard_redeveloped) with HS FVIC, JF Bavarian Cream, WF Bourbon Aged Cream, and WF Salted Caramel, with some sweetener. **TASK 6** and a more complex one, [Delectable Bourbon Custard](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/280248-delectable_bourbon_custard_) with much of the same except TFA Bavarian instead of JF, plus FLV Bourbon, FA Custard Premium, and TFA Vanilla Custard 2. **TASK 7**

**Ginger**

Some sweetness to it, but more of a dry ginger spice, does such a good job of emulating that, it seems very well suited for bakeries. A bit throaty, no more than you might expect for a spice flavor, but more than some other ginger flavors.

Was already going to mix one recipe that uses it, Gringo. Another one that’s caught my eye is this three-ingredient [Ginger Ale](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/134801-ginger_ale). I can’t say that it looks good, but it’s just HS Ginger, TFA Juicy Peach, and TFA Key Lime and have to see whether that really comes together to taste like ginger ale somehow. **TASK 8**

**Gingerbread**

This is a pretty light flavor, even at 3%, I’m not getting a ton of flavor and might need to push it even higher in the future. What I did get was somewhere between gingerbread and rye bread. A bit dry and top heavy, with bready top notes and some warm ginger bakery spice but not much flavor beyond the initial hint of ginger and bread, needs something like a cake or cookie flavor to “finish” it as well as some more dark sweetness. The bready part is a little too much like bread or toast rather than cakey sweet bread, and the ginger is oddly little rye-like.

It’s probably going to taste outdated, but I’ll give “A bestselling Chef’s Flavours One Shot from the 2016 Christmas Collection” a try: [MarRY Christmas](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/79522-ckemist_original_marry_christmas__thechristmasmix). It’s described as “a holiday spiced Gingerbread RY4 with a hint of whipped cream.” **TASK 9**

**Grape**

Medicinal grape. Sweet and dense candy purple top notes, growing bitterness that blends into a chalky finish, basically chewable grape children’s motrin in vape form. I like how sweet it is upfront but something would need to cover the rest of that flavor for it to work well. **TRASH 3**

**Green Orange**

Not much flavor to it at 2%, no zesty top notes, just a thin base of weirdly bitter and slightly perfumy orange. **TRASH 4**

**Honey**

Does not taste like honey at all. Not even a little bit. It tastes weird, more like sweetened rosewater than anything else I could associate with it. It’s a wet flavor, not dry at all, sweet but not extra sticky sweet, and a strong, rose-ish floral. Not terribly perfumy or unpleasant to vape, not chemical tasting or anything like that, and it might be a kinder, gentler option for a rose note than FA Rose, but does not taste like honey. It’s weird because HS Watermelon tastes a bit like this, too. HS just has a thing for rose, I guess. I might use it for rose if FLV Rose Essence didn’t exist. **TRASH 5**

**Ice Cream**

Bears no resemblance to any ice cream I’ve ever had, but it kind of tastes like what I imagine severely over churned ice cream might taste like. It’s basically condensed buttermilk flavor. Seriously, it even had that little tang that buttermilk has, it’s just a little thicker and sweeter than buttermilk. Awesome ingredient, but not a lot of fun to vape by itself unless maybe you’re one of those weirdos who will drink straight buttermilk. I’m not getting any vanilla.

[Crumberry Cream](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/113695-crumberry_cream) looks amazing and is already on the to-do list.

I went through 16 other recipes and the one that looked most interesting to me was this [Ijsboerke Vanille à la Crème Fraîche](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/123765-ijsboerke_vanille_%C3%A0_la_cr%C3%A8me_fra%C3%AEche). Time to find out what Belgian vanilla ice cream is all about. **TASK 10**

**Irish Cream**

There is nothing Irish about this cream. It tastes like spreading butter on a piece of very old white chocolate. It’s a very thick, heavy, buttery, cream with a light hint of sweet vanilla. Unfortunately for all its thickness, it’s not really smooth. It comes across more like a chalky attempt at buttery white chocolate than Irish cream. **TRASH 6**

**Italian Cream**

That is mascarpone. Mass Car Poe Neigh. It’s a very thick and rich and very tangy extra heavy dairy cream. If you don’t know what mascarpone tastes like, it’s very much like cream cheese. The tang doesn’t taste puky like concentrates with a lot of butyric acid to me but it might to some people who are especially sensitive to it. Still, not a lot of fun to vape solo, but this would be perfect to fix a yogurt or cheesecake recipe that isn’t tangy enough, or with a sugary sweet cream as part of a cream cheese frosting. If you are adding a Greek Yogurt flavor to CAP Sweet Yogurt to make it more of a grown-up yogurt or to cheesecakes to make them more authentic, you might want to use this instead because the Greek yogurt flavors tend to run a little on the chalky side while this is very, very smooth.

Already have three or four recipes using this in my task list, here’s one more: [Italian Cream Cake](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/204234-italian_cream_cake), even though I don’t agree that 1% HS Italian Cream tastes like butter cream icing, I can’t pass up coconut almond cake. **TASK 11**

**Juicy Peach**

A more natural peach flavor that’s both soft and potent. At full flavored at 1.5%, it’s more than twice as strong as several other options, but it tastes like a softer peach, almost a white peach, without the yellow acidic intensity of other peach flavors. Sugary peach body that carries through the vape. Has a bit of a funny after taste almost like peach skin, a bit vegetal or floral, which you’d expect to find more to the front, which is odd. Tastes like it could be superb in a fruit mix where the fruits are supposed to taste natural, as long as some other fruit overrides that aftertaste. I get no throat irritation from this one at all, which is outstanding for a peach flavor.

I’ll try this [Virgin Fuzzy Navel](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/260110-virgin_fuzzy_navel_peach_pow) peach and orange mix that uses it along with FA White Peach, TFA Nectarine, and TFA Orange Cream. **TASK 12**

**Kiwi Mix**

It tastes like what the Kiwi is mixed with is cherry with a touch of new vinyl shower curtain off note. Shame because it’s otherwise sweet and pleasant, kind of tastes like a kiwi, but that plasticky thing is just hanging out along the edges and lingering in my sinuses and it’s just no good. **TRASH 7**

**Lemonade**

That does not taste like lemonade. I’m not sure what it tastes like exactly, but it tastes more like Fruit Loops than lemonade. Like just the fruit from Fruit Loops, without the actual cereal. I can absolutely see using this to make a from-scratch fruit loops juice, but not as a lemonade. **TRASH 8**

**Litchi**

Moldy Welch’s white grape juice filtered through dryer sheets. So this is identifiable as a lychee flavor, but at the same time, all kinds of horrible. Where there should be a little funky tropical ripeness, it tastes like rot. Where there should be a subtle rosy floral, there’s a mouthful of laundry room. It’s sweet and has a deep, thick body, but where there should be a little citrusy tartness, there’s the taste of the same kind of citrusy note that’s in INW Cactus and a disproportionate amount of throat hit for the amount of flavor. **TRASH 9**

**Longan**

A better lychee than HS Litchi, but kinda weird. It’s supposed to taste like a muskier lychee, as best I can tell from a quick googling, but it actually tastes like lychee plus an almond-like nuttiness. You get that rosy floral upfront, but the rest is nearly an almond butter and white grape jelly sandwich without the bread. It’s a sweet and syrupy flavor overall, though the floral is a bit on the dry side. **TRASH 10**

**Mango**

This is an odd and unrealistic flavor, but not unpleasant. The mango tastes like artificial mango syrup, like the kind used to make snow cones, very bright and sweet and just unapologetically candy, but the body is really creamy and has some cream taste, like adding cream to a snow cone. No piney anything, barely any tropical funkiness at all. I don’t need it. **TRASH 11**

**No. 5**

Very nutty, specifically kinda roasted peanutty, lots of AP and probably other pyrazines in here, dry, slight brown tobacco backnote, a little smoky, a little caramelly sweetness but not much. Definitely more nut than bacco, but I’d rather add this than TFA Acetyl Pyrazine or CAP Cereal 27 if I’m needing some AP in a tobacco.

Chemical Burn Victim’s Irish Oak that uses it was a fairly recent addition to my to-mix queue. I’m missing an ingredient or two for his [Unfiltered](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/87620-unfiltered_) recipe, but some of the other things going on there interest me so I’ll create something inspired by it.

Dirty Nut Bacco V1 **TASK 13**

| Flavor | Co.                | %    |
| ------ | ------------------ | ---- |
| HS     | No. 5              | 3    |
| HS     | Desert Ship        | 1    |
| INW    | Dirty Neutral Base | 1    |
| FLV    | Red Burley         | 1.5  |
| FLV    | Arabian Tobacco    | 0.25 |

**Peanut Butter**

An overly sharp, slightly chemical, very dry peanut butter, really more of a roasted (borderline over-roasted) peanut without any sticky sweet creamy peanut butteryness. It’s not the worst and I can see it working in a variety of applications, but it sure ain’t Skippy. I’ll just stick to TFA DX PB, SSA PB, and WF PB Taffy. **TRASH 12**

**Pina Colada**

Hairspray White Gummy Pina Colada. Imagine you wanted a pina colada RIGHT NOW and did not have any rum or pineapple juice to mix with your coconut cream. But you do have white gummy bears, which are sort of pineapple flavored, and hairspray, which might make you feel drunk before you die. You could put all that in a blender, or you could just vape HS Pina Colada, which has a hairspray off note right off the bat and then some white gummy bear flavor before getting to the sweet, creamy coconut finish. **TRASH 13**

**Pineapple**

Tastes like you took a fist-sized white gummy bear, made it a cute little grass hula skirt for it out of raw green onions, and then shoved it, skirt and all, into your facehole. The sweet, slightly-waxy but mostly chewy pineapple-ish gummy candy flavor finish is like 95% of the vape, but I get hit with that green onion right on top and would rather not. **TRASH 14**

**Pumpkin Pie**

Does not really taste pumpkin pie flavor but it’s worth noting how interestingly silky it vapes. Like it has the right texture for pumpkin pie, where it's fluffy but a little rich at the same time, and smooth. Appropriate sweetness level for a pumpkin pie too, but it doesn’t taste quite right. Extremely light spice, nowhere near enough for a pumpkin pie, can’t even tell what spice it is, just a very light warm spice. No crust flavor like you would expect from a pumpkin pie. Very mellow, pleasant to vape, bland but inoffensive. It doesn’t taste like much of anything, just silky smooth thick sweet body with the slightest hint of pumpkinish flavor. But that silky smooth thing might have a similar effect to adding pumpkin puree to a baked recipe. I pushed it really high trying to make it give me some real flavor and it just doesn’t. There’s a very light kinda peach/strawberry fruitiness on top at 6% that I didn’t notice lower. Generally recommend using around 3 to 4%.

I already have a pumpkin churro and pumpkin pudding mixes in line. What I didn’t have, until now, was a delicious-looking [Pumpkin Spice Cookie Custard](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/248152-pumpkin_spice_cookie_custard). **TASK 14**
