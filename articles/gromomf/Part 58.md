TASK OR TRASH - Each flavor gets assigned at least one task or it goes in the trash.

# CAP 27 Bears

Update. This was in no danger of being thrown out because I need it to make [Giant Swan](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/247312#giant_swan_by_concreteriver). But I mixed four recipes looking for another reason to keep it. Three of them got 4 stars. One got 5 but still didn't stand out as a new favorite recipe. So for now at least, it seems there's nothing else for me to do with 27 Bears except mix even more Giant Swan. And that's okay. **TASK 1**

# INAWERA

**Pyramid**

I think the name “Pyramid” might be a play on “pyrazine” as in acetyl pyrazine. It's absolutely loaded with the stuff so much that 2% is roasted nuttiness but it's right on the cusp of crossing over into corn chippiness. Also sweet, like that spun sugar sort of top note sweetness, and very dry. Bizarrely described as a “sweet tobacco with a touch of ash on the end” by Inawera, get none of that. I definitely could see using it to add sweetness and nuttiness to a tobacco, but it's definitely not a tobacco by itself at all and there's not a hint of ash anywhere. It's not unpleasant but it's basically a shitty version of FA SOHO, where it tastes generally like SOHO but without any of the complexity of SOHO. Would not be even remotely surprised, if I found out INW Pyramid is literally just ethyl maltol and acetyl pyrazine in PG and nothing else, because that's exactly what it tastes like. **TRASH 1**

**Raspberry (Malina)**

I know this is a lot of people's favorite raspberry, and there's a good reason for that. It's also intensely flavorful. It's also very potent, and can get aggressively floral above even just 1%, depending on what it's mixed with. Less than 1%, it's a pretty tasty but somewhat odd combination of tart, slightly floral top notes, and an oddly warm, very sweet, candy raspberry base that's a bit dark.

Someone ruined INW Malina Raspberry for me slightly by calling out that odd warmth, where it feels like you've got the TC turned up higher than you do, by saying it tastes like a red raspberry-flavor sucker that someone's already sucked on. That's gross. But to add to that partially sucked sucker impression, it's kind of juicy, definitely not dry.

I've planned to try more than half a dozen recipes that use this already. Here's some more:

[Citraspberry Soda](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/148968-citraspberry_soda). It's a soda by the soda guy and it looks terrific. I love the idea of using a little FLV Boysenberry to back up INW Raspberry. **TASK 2**

[Dragonberry Milk](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/226837-dragonberry_milk). I don't know about that much TFA Raspberry Sweet, but the combination of TFA Bavarian Cream and Vanilla Swirl with TFA Dragonfruit, works for me, and so does the INW Raspberry. Seems worth a mix. **TASK 3**

[Star-Spangled Banger](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/219420-starspangled_banger). A red white and blue tobacco, with INW Raspberry for the red, VT Bilberry Ripe for blue, and TFA French Vanilla Deluxe. It could be terrible, but it's something I can't not try. **TASK 4**

**Raspberry WG**

INW has like four raspberries, and it's important to make sure you're buying or using the right one. The Wera Garden one is super potent. 0.25 percent was a little soft, 0.5% is full flavored. It's weirdly both candyish and has some greenish floral on top. Like berry candy with a little natural berry stem attached. It's tart and sweet and kind of like a sweet-tart candy, as it's dry and a little chalky or powdery, not juicy at all. It's also less “red” than I expect a raspberry to be, more like a boysenberry. INW Raspberry WG definitely my least favorite of the INW raspberries I have, both because of that green floral hint and because even just a drop off it in a 10ml feels so dry. **TRASH 2**

**Raspberry-Blackberry**

This is the INW Lime incident all over again. This was apparently reformulated a few years ago. Unlike INW Lime I never got a chance to try the old version, but quite a few people I know liked very much. The new one is lackluster, but not offensive. Apparently the old one was also highly potent? Not anymore. 3% isn't much flavor at all. I don't get separate blackberry and raspberry notes from this or even a distinctive blackberry component at all. I just get a generic dark mixed berry flavor that's a little black cherry-ish, with some identifiable raspberry candy body and a slight tartness, while the overall flavor is fairly flat, thin, subdued, and a little dry. It does have a pleasant, lingering finish of raspberry candy, though. **TRASH 3**

**Red for Pipe**

This is weird. It tastes like kissing a pipe smoker who wears cherry ChapStick, but less waxy. Seriously, it tastes like they mixed together INW Cherries, Gold For Pipe, and Dark For Pipe. There's a bright red cherry candy right on top, a lot of that leafier gold pipe tobacco, and some of that much darker, spicier, kind of fruity smokey black pipe tobacco. Personally, I feel like that's a weird combination. There's a certain type of cherry I associate as being a good cherry flavor with tobacco, and bright red cherry candy isn't it. But structurally as in the way it vapes, and in terms of not having any weird off notes or anything like that, I can't find anything wrong with it. Full bodied at 1.5% but maybe short of full-flavored, it tastes like it could easily go higher and be bolder without getting any weirder than it already is. Overall, the “For Pipe” flavors are some of my favorite tobaccos, but this is one I can do without. **TRASH 4**

**Rhubarb**

Extremely potent and powerful. 0.5% tastes like more than enough. Tart & Sweet. A little astringent. Tastes like rhubarb plus just a little vintage Sea Breeze facial cleanser. Basically tastes like celery and really tart grapes had a weird baby and wrapped it in raw turnip greens. Another one that's not great by itself, but tastes like it would work really well counter balanced with something very sweet and syrupy. It already has a syrupy feel to the sweetness it has, but it still feels like it needs more to counter that powerful astringency. Vaping it standalone, again, not fun. This one has been used in the most recipes, I think, but... It tastes like people are using the wrong rhubarb, or at least not using the easiest one to make great things out of. Not when other options include DV Rhubarb Cuddle, WF Sweet & Sour Rhubarb, and VT Rhubarb Compote.

I felt like I tried enough recipes using INW Rhubarb to toss it, but then I saw this: [Rhubarb Fairy](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/272380-rhubarb_fairy) and decided to give it one last chance. The dairy cream-vanilla base looks fantastic, the Rhubarb doesn't look overused, and the touch of CAP Ripe Strawberries is really interesting. **TASK 5**

**Sesame**

It tastes like sesame oil. Very strange thing to vape by itself, not a very fun thing to do, but the authenticity is on point, even has a kind of oily feel to it. If you must have sesame oil for something and you need it to be hyper realistic and not bring along any baggage, this is the one, although I'd much rather make stuff out of INW Sesame Sweets or WF Sesame Candy because they're both more pleasant to vape. I've heard that INW reformulated Sesame and made it gross and weird, then reformulated it again and made it a lot more like the original, but not exactly like it. I think the latest version is the one I have. So the biggest problem with this flavor is seeing INW Sesame in a recipe and not knowing which one version was used to make it. Maybe having someone mix your recipe using the wrong version and getting terrible results, and thinking that's your fault. You could avoid all of that by just not using INW Sesame.

I'm probably going to wind up tossing it because how many sesame flavors does one person need, but [Apple Sesame Pie](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/197435-apple_sesame_pie) is too tempting to pass up. **TASK 6**

**Sesame Sweets**

It has a toasted sesame oil top note on a body similar to a darker butter toffee, with lingering honey and molasses notes. Emphasis on the butter in butter toffee, it has a definite hint of butter and the buttery richness to go with it. Also has a touch of “biscuity” taste, like there's some INW Biscuit in there and that's where the butter is coming from. It tastes strong and bold like it might run all over a recipe at 0.75%.

I need it for one of my favorite recipes, [Brown Sugar Sesame Waffle](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/211037-brown_sugar_sesame_waffle). **TASK 7**

This profile is wild, “white chocolate sesame matcha cake,” but [A mouthful](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/257429-a_mouthful_) looks like it might be as good as it is weird. **TASK 8**

**Shisha Apple**

A unique apple that's really tart but doesn't taste like a green apple. It's more like a red apple with an extra-thick skin. Like what little tartness is in a red apple all resides in the skin, and this has a lot of that. But instead of the peel tasting floral or spicy, it's just a crisp, tart bite. Like it gets that crunch when you bite into a fresh apple, and then goes just a little overboard with it. Not enough to be offensive, just a bit odd and kind of trippy because red apples aren't supposed to be so tart but this is definitely red and not that distinctively green apple. The apple underneath is sweet with a little lingering tartness and reminds me of an unspiced apple cider made from red apples. I'm used to either spice or alcohol in cider - this isn't boozy but does taste a bit like one of those hard ciders or the apple part of a red apple ale. It's definitely not dry, but I'd call it more syrupy sweet than juicy, the kind that sweetness that can seem juicy at first but gets a little dry as you continue to vape it. I want to use it in fruit mixes where that peel might stand out as distinctly apple right up front.

It seems it would've been a better apple for the original Strap-On than the FA Fuji I used to make, so I'll give that a try.

Shisha Strap-On V1 **TASK 9**

| Co. | Flavor            | %   |
| --- | ----------------- | --- |
| INW | Shisha Strawberry | 3   |
| INW | Shisha Apple      | 3   |
| INW | Watermelon        | 3   |

**Shisha Bilberry**

Weird. It tastes like funky, earthy but sweet blueberry tea with a touch of eucalyptus in it. The funk leans toward feet. It's a footy funk. Not real stinky feet, just generic foot smell. And it's just a hint. It's definitely blueberry and it's kinda syrupy sweet, as the Shisha line tends to be, but there's an earthy bitterness that strongly reminds me of tea. And it took me a while to pick it out, but there really is a touch of eucalyptus in there. I smelled the bottle after trying it and the euc is even stronger that way. I dunno what they are thinking. I don't hate it, but it's just really weird. **TRASH 5**

**Shisha Lemon**

Like sweet lemon syrup. Tastes great, very smooth, nothing I would consider an off note here. Neither a natural lemon or a candy lemon, hard to describe but it's lemon syrup, like you might use to make a lemon soda; but without the carbonated water. Has just a hint of zesty lime, but it's very lemon forward.

I need it for [The Back Nine](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/122659-the_back_nine).

This “super creamy lemon cheesecake” called [Give Thanks to the Lemon Heads!](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/296917-give_thanks_to_the_lemon_heads_) recipe looks good too, especially with it being someone's first recipe. **TASK 10**

**Shisha Lime**

Tastes like a much zestier, lighter version of CAP Lemon Lime. There's some nice tartness and sharper lime zest in the top notes but the base is syrupy, sweet lime-forward lemon-lime flavor. It's not quite as heavy and sweet a syrup as CAP Lemon Lime though. It seems like you could get the same effect mixing a little FA Lime Distilled with CAP Lemon Lime.

I need it for Chem Twista Lime by CBV, and it's used in a couple of recipes I picked out when considering whether to keep HC Sour Cherry (haven't gotten that far down the to-mix list yet). Found several more that look great or at least worth a shake:

[Sticky Limeade](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/113447-saturdiy_sticky_limeade), describe by creator ConcreteRiver as “a big bright lime flavor with some popsicle stickiness” and reviewer Kindground as “like a melted lime popsicle.” I love lime. **TASK 11**

[Easy Peasy Key Lime Squeezy](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/212943-easy_peasy_key_lime_squeezy) a key lime pie that might not be anything fancy, but it's just three ingredients, why not give it a try? **TASK 12**

[L.L. Gummy](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/170725-ll_gummy__bmw__developed). Lemon lime gummy sounds great to me, and this one by NaChef looks well thought-out. **TASK 13**

[Lime Cooler](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/268532-lime_cooler). Lemon, lime, and gin. Yes, please. **TASK 14**

**Shisha Mango**

Because of how good most of Inawera's other Shisha flavors are, I don't know that I've ever been more excited to try a flavor, but what a massive disappointment INW Shisha Mango was. Right up front, it tastes like tires. Not as bad as a tire fire, but like walking into a tire store. Behind that, just some sweet but green, very underripe mango. **TRASH 6**

**Shisha Peppermint**

Extra icy. Very potent, extra super mentholated almost painfully icy cold candy-type peppermint with a sweet syrupy base and nothing off. I almost got a brain freeze from this, I think. If you love menthol and WS-23 and like peppermint, you'll probably think this is an awesome flavor. I think it's awesome, and could easily see Shisha Peppermint being many people's favorite peppermint, but it's really more menthol than peppermint at this point, the sweet syrupy peppermint is like an afterthought to all that ice.

I don't have a recipe for this, but I'll mix a whole big bottle all by itself at 1% to vape next time I have a head cold or allergies or my sinuses otherwise try to declare war on me. **TASK 15**

**Shisha Punch**

I hope you didn't mix this expecting something like Hawaiian punch or Kool-aid “fruit punch” - it is very much not that.

INW Shisha Punch is an orange peel and spice blend, similar to Flavorah's Back Bar Bitters but with a different balance. The orange peel is prominent and the spice blend is clove-forward, but with a bit of cinnamon and something else, maybe cardamom or ginger, behind that. I can definitely see using it for something like a mulled wine or spiced cider. Maybe in a spiced cake like fruitcake. But for cocktail bitters - which I think is what this is supposed to taste like - I'm more inclined to reach for FLV Back Bar Bitters because it is more balanced and not as orange peel and clove dominant as Shisha Punch. **TRASH 7**

**Shisha Raspberry**

Super good, especially compared to most other Raspberries. It's INW Shisha Strawberry, but in Raspberry. INW Shisha Raspberry tastes like Raspberry syrup with a mix of artificial flavor and actual raspberries. There's a little tartness and just enough of that almost floral quality to come across as something that had a real raspberry involved in making it, but nowhere near as much as FA Raspberry or an excess of INW Raspberry Malina. The base here is darkly sweet and syrupy... it tastes like the kind of raspberry syrup in coffee shops that they add to drinks to give them a raspberry flavor. Like Italian soda syrup. Even though 2% is full flavored, I tried cranking it up 3%. The main difference was that it tasted even darker and more jammy than syrupy, but it was also a little more tart and a teensy bit more floral and I could see where 3% might be too much for some people or some mixes, but I still loved it.

Need it for two favorites, [Crazberry Crack](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/32359-crazberry_crack), and one that I haven't mentioned in GRMoMF yet, [Rhuberry Delight](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/115541-rhuberry_delight). The only thing I don't love about Rhuberry Delight is that the 0.5% CAP Super Sweet comes across a little heavy-handed here, so I'm going to mix it with 0.25% SS this time and see how that goes. **TASK 16**

It's also in a few recipes I've slated for mixing, and take a look at these additional finds:

[Kaguya](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/210089-kaguya). The lemonade base looks like it MIGHT have some room for improvement, but I love the idea of a raspberry-lychee lemonade too much to not try it. **TASK 17**

[Razul](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/234455-razul). Always on the lookout for a new favorite blue razz recipe. **TASK 18**

[Strawberry Mash Mal-Oh](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/287927-strawberry_mash_mal%E2%80%99oh_ssms). It had me at OoO Marshmallow Vanilla and WF Strawberry Gummy Candy. **TASK 19**

**Shisha Vanilla**

Creamy and smooth with an assertive vanilla. Think vanilla cream with more emphasis on the vanilla than on the cream. I've seen it described variably as a bright vanilla and a dark vanilla, I think it's both, sort of. I consider it a bright creamy vanilla with a darker syrupy sweetness to it. It doesn't really get lost in a mix, it stands out enough to give you vanilla even when mixed with bold tobaccos. Might even distract from other flavors. It does get a bit waxy above 1%, but you probably don't need more than 1% to get all the vanilla flavor you want.

This is used in so many recipes, I'm not even going to bother trying to list the ones I love or plan to try already. Here's one more to add to the pile: [Tiger Tails](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/252256-tiger_tails). Orange and black licorice ice cream. Speaking of piles, this one has a nice pile of glowing five-star reviews. **TASK 20**

**Shortbread**

Slightly rancid butter. Tastes like you tried to make a shortbread, ran out of good butter somewhere short of mixing the dough, and supplemented the rest with some rancid old butter. The shortbread part is nice, light and crumbly, not too much AP-ness but enough crunch for a great texture and plenty of body, but that butter is just a little bit wrong. **TRASH 8**

**Sparkling Wine**

Like a glass of cheap sparkling wine with a shot of bubblegum-flavored snow cone syrup at the bottom. Mostly tastes like champagne, a little bubbly, and very slightly boozy, but I get a fairly strong pink bubblegum off note with it. Maybe that can be covered up in a mix. If not, it would make a great additive for a bubblegum-flavored soda, which is a real thing for some reason, or a bubblegum flavored snow cone. Sweet and syrupy base is where it tastes like bubblegum, top notes are white grape with a hint of apple and have that damp powdery thing that passes for fizz. Also, the booze part is a little rhubarb-y and almost camphorous on a fresh drip, though that seems to fade away pretty quickly, it's off-putting at first. **TRASH 9**

**Spicy Biscuits**

Pumpkin spice. Not much of a biscuit, but it's interesting. It's more like a cinnamon-forward pumpkin spice flavor, with some nutmeg or allspice in there as well, and tiny bits of ginger and clove, and just a bit of buttery biscuity cookie on the end. I would use this for some kind of pumpkin spice bakery recipe if I didn't have FLV Pumpkin Spice or if that wasn't working out for me for whatever reason.

There are three recipes on ATF that use it. One of them I already plan to mix, one of them I don't want to mix, and [Autumn's Splendor](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/289275-autumn%E2%80%99s_splendor). I don't know why it was necessary to use both Spicy Biscuits and FLV Pumpkin Spice here. I also don't know why you'd need SSA Honeycomb Crumble Type when VT Honeycomb exists. But it looks good, definitely good enough to be worth a try. **TASK 21**

**Strawberry**

Plastic strawberry lemonade. I don't know what the deal is with the lemon. I expect that sort of thing out of FA, but not INW. It mostly tastes like a middle-of-the road, in terms of natural/candy, strawberry, but with a lemony citrus behind it. There's also this very slight plasticy edge not exactly like the plastic nightmare cherry off-note, but close. It's possible that what I tasted is over-flavoring at 2%, it's a strong flavor at 3%, though I see a few recipes with it at 3%, so I don't know... Regardless, it's definitely not a strawberry I would mix with any kind of cherry, for fear of amplifying that, but it does taste like a strawberry that would be good with citrus. Lingering tart strawberry flavor, also tastes like a small amount of it might be good for freshening up a more bland, more ripe strawberry. I also found it to have just a little throat hit to it. I have so many strawberry flavors. This seems like one I could do without. **TRASH 10**

**Strawberry Kiss**

It's like you had very waxy strawberry candy, like if those halloween wax lips came in strawberry, and lemonhead candy at the same time, with a squirt of perfume on both. It could be over-flavoring even at just 1% - this is a really strong flavor. Or it could be under-steeping at just four to five days. Or it could just be what this flavor tastes like, which is what I'm leaning toward because that waxiness and perfumy floral thing is very strong, not just a little off bit. It's supposed to be strawberry with a “kiss” of cream but I get zero cream from this. **TRASH 11**

**Sweet Tobacco**

Not necessarily a dessert tobacco, but is sweet. Lighter, brighter tobacco flavor with a little hay or “grassiness” in tobacco parlance to it. Has a distinctly honey-like sweetness. Somewhat floral but not perfumy, more like honey. It's not gross or unpleasant, I just don't have anything I want to make with it. **TRASH 12**

**Sweet Tornado**

I don't know why I have this and haven't tried it yet. Will do 1%, 2%, and 4% samples. **TASK 21**

**Tobacco Don Hill**

Haven't tried. Will do a 2% sample. **TASK 22**

**Tobacco Symphony**

Tastes like dirty peanuts, shell and all. Not really tobacco, just dirty peanut shells and peanuts. **TRASH 13**

**Tobacco Absolute Virginia**

Tastes like a high highly processed cigarette tobacco, with all the chemical additives and crap, so not American Spirits, but like Basics, which in turn taste like crap they swept off the floor at the Marlboro factory. Medium bright, a bit sweet, dry, something ammonia-like but only the slightest hint of it.

I need (for now) it because I already planned to try CBV's Irish Oak. Will also shake up [Nana's Smoke](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/225237-nannas_smoke), a mango-vanilla tobacco inspired by Fear's Abuela. **TASK 23**

**Turkish Tobacco**

This gots some stank on it. It is a lightly spicy brighter tobacco flavor that's fairly gentle at 2%, not a slap upside the face with tobacco. Spice notes are indistinct but taste a little like light hints of clove, cardamom, and cinnamon all tangled up together. There's a strange sweet fruity and weirdly sour quality to it. That's a bit of a turn off to me. The sourness tastes a little like spoiled milk sourness to me and it lingers a bit and makes for a stanky room note. I think that might be overflavoring with a 2% sample though, because I tried a recipe with it at 1% and it was not spoiled milky-tasting at all. So maybe just use this one with caution. Or, be like me and don't use it at all. **TRASH 14**

**Two Apples**

It tastes like dried green apples. Not those crunchy apple chips, but the chewy apple slices that are more like the apple version of raisins. A little earthy, with a thick concentrated syrupy sweetness, but a touch of the tanginess of a green apple. It doesn't taste candied, it's more of a concentrated sweetness like those dried apple slices have. Not a fresh apple. Not juicy but not especially dry, more of a sticky sweetness. Mixed with juicier components, seems like it might be good in a cider, or in a bakery like bits of apple in a pie.

I have planned to mix two recipes that use it, here's another: [Ryuk](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/208618-ryuk). “Spiced tea with bright apples and black currant.” I'm piqued. **TASK 24**

**USA Mix**

I'll mix a 3% sample but am not optimistic, based on the lack of recipes that use it. **TASK 25**

**Vanilla Bourbon**

If you gave me an unlabeled sample of this and told me it was a vanilla marshmallow flavor I would believe you. Strong, super fluffy, bright as hell vanilla. Dense, very sweet and fluffy, not creamy just thick, a bit dry. Very artificial vanilla up against an oddly natural sweetness. It's not bad, but I have a whole herd of vanillas to thin and this is one I can get by without. **TRASH 15**

**Vanilla Classic**

A bright artificial vanilla with some jammy vague fruitiness (maybe cherry), with a light whipped cream sort of texture. Another vanilla that is neither bad nor necessary. **TRASH 16**

**Vanilla**

A darker but not spicy sweet vanilla that tastes sort of like a vanilla malt, but doesn't feel like one. It's creamy, but nowhere near as creamy as a malted milkshake. It's sweet but it's a very malty sweetness and it has a hint of being almost roasted. Slightly bitter edge despite all the sweetness, like molasses. Kind of odd, not yucky, but just kind of odd. **TRASH 17**

**Vanilla for Pipe**

Not a lot of tobacco, but a bright vanilla with a slight touch of lighter but accurate tobacco with a little of that hay flavor to it. Smooth but not-quite-creamy feel.

Since I've already listed more than a dozen recipes with Vanilla for Pipe in them elsewhere, you'd think I wouldn't be able to find another one, but you'd be wrong. [Ole Tyme Pipe](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/296394-ole_tyme_pipe) with its mixture of three of the For Pipe flavors along with FA Soho and some FLV Arabian, looks great, as long as 0.5% doesn't turn out to be too much of that Arabian **TASK 26**

**Waffle**

This was discontinued ages ago and I've been clinging to a bottle that's mostly empty and probably not even good anymore for like, sentimental reasons, as I don't think there ever will be a better waffle flavor. RIP. **TRASH 18**

**Watermelon**

1% is light and mild, and tastes somewhat like a real watermelon, though there's not much flavor there, which is also accurate to a real watermelon. Not super juicy or very sweet, but not as dry as FA Watermelon despite having a similar natural flavor. 3% is strong full on watermelon candy flavor, with some tartness that makes it more like Watermelon Jolly Ranchers than the LA Watermelon that people say tastes like watermelon jolly ranchers, and a hint of something that tells me it would be soapy and possibly floral if I took any higher, though it's not really there yet. It's a bit sweet and still not really juicy, but kind of mouthwatering so it's not too dry, and kind of has a hard candy type feel to it.

In addition to the “Shisha Strap-On V1” idea above, I'll use it to mix a blatantly candied version.

Candy Strap-On V1 **TASK 27**

| Co. | Flavor            | %   |
| --- | ----------------- | --- |
| INW | Watermelon        | 3   |
| WF  | Green Jolly Candy | 3   |
| JF  | Sweet Strawberry  | 3   |

I doubt those %s will work as well as I want them to, it's just a starting place.

**Western Blend**

I don't get tobacco. It just tastes like licking a messy toddler's chocolate fingerprints off a saddle. I guess there's something dry and dirty about it that could be tobaccoesque, but seriously it's mostly saddle but also has a lot of inexplicable chocolate, and some faint fruity cherry/prune/fig type of flavor way in the background.
I need it to try CBV's Southern Lights.

I wish it had that leathery flavor to use as an accent with tobacco without the chocolate. But since the chocolate is there, why not explore a classic pairing - chocolate and peanut butter - but with the tobacco that that leather note needs?

Buckeye Bacco V1 **TASK 28**

| Co. | Flavor              | %    |
| --- | ------------------- | ---- |
| INW | Western Blend       | 1.25 |
| TFA | DX Peanut Butter    | 4    |
| WF  | Taffy Peanut Butter | 1    |
| WF  | Chocolate Frosting  | 2    |
| FLV | Red Burley          | 1.5  |
| FLV | Native Tobacco      | 1    |

**White Grapefruit**

Basically just grapefruit zest. Bitter white grapefruit peel with tartness but without a lot of sweeter fruit body. More neutral, flat, somewhat waxy volume under that strong, heavy peel note. Dry, needs something sweeter and juicier to fill it in. Probably would use this to make another grapefruit fresher and more natural, maybe to do the same with another citrus or things that should have some bitter edge, like cranberries that taste too much like cranberry sauce rather than fresh cranberries.

I need it for a couple of favorites, Terrorhawk and Grunch.

Will also try [Sierra Bonita - Paloma Del Sol](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/216920-sierra_bonita__paloma_del_sol). Citrus and tequila is a no brainer, but I'm really interested in how that FLV Heat works with them. **TASK 29**

**Wild Ice Cream**

The picture INW put with it has green grapes spilling out of an ice cream cone. It's not bad, if you like Koolada, but seems to be very weirdly named because that bit of coolant on the end is the only nod to “ice cream” here. It tastes like tart and sweet green grapes. I don't get any dairy cream or ice cream cone flavor from it at all. It has some of that tannic and tart grape skin flavor with only the slightest floral edge. It isn't juicy, but it's not unusually dry, either. Has a moderate jammy sweetness. I just wish it didn't come with Koolada pre-added because it's otherwise a pretty good green grape. **TRASH 19**

**Wild Strawberry**

A strawberry, yes. But also the entire strawberry garden. The stems, the leaves, the flowers, the rich, loamy soil, all of that. It's a sweet but wild-type strawberry, much darker than a regular strawberry, nearly a blackberry-strawberry combo. But it has hints of green leafiness and floral and a bunch of earthiness that crosses the line and tastes literally like earth, aka dirt. **TRASH 20**

**Yes We Cheesecake**

Stupid name and not perfect, but a very solid cheesecake. Tastes like cheesecake with a graham crust to me. Authentic tanginess, authentic buttery crust. Not quite as thick and creamy as it should be, not quite as sweet as it should be, but clearly a flavorful cheesecake flavor that doesn't suffer from serious issues. Some people get a coconut off-note, I don't, but I'm pretty sure there's some gamma-octolone in there, which tastes like coconut, and some people are more sensitive to that than I am.

Went to my to-do list and counted 21 (!!!) recipes using YWC. Just two more:

[Divinity](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/168392-divinity) it's a little odd looking (cheesecake with a lot of Cereal 27) but probably incredible. **TASK 30**

[King Bling](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/182090-king_bling_vanilla_custard). I don't know whether it will stand out from the haystack of vanilla custard recipes, but I can't imagine it not tasting good. **TASK 31**

New Flavor Count: 2,267
