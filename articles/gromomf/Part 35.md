TASK OR TRASH - Each flavor gets assigned at least one task or it goes in the trash.

## CAPELLA

**French Vanilla**

Started this week with five steeping CAP French Vanilla recipes all coming of age in the next few days. One of them was an old recipe that I took a chance on and it wasn't that great. Too much CAP Cake Batter (which can get gnarly) or just overflavoring in general, I think. Another was a mango-passionfruit custard that is delicious but not something that I just gotta mix again.

One of them was a strawberry & cream that I only gave 4 out of 5 stars. Not because it wasn't delicious - it absolutely was - but because it's just a great-tasting strawberry cream and there are hundreds of those. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is that it isn't special. After leaving a review, I already heard back from the creator, and they are working on a new, improved version. CAP French Vanilla might be worth keeping around just in case it's in that version. In the meantime, one thing the boring tastiness of this recipe did was make me want to go back and see if I'd missed any potentially special strawberry & cream recipes using CAP French Vanilla. Most of them just look... too old. One of them wanted a 60-day steep. The one that looked most interesting to me is this [Strawberry Vape Train](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/208430#strawberry_vape_train_by_brdz). I don't agree with BRDZ's assertion that Vape Train's Strawberry Custard is that great by itself, but with CAP French Vanilla, VT Sweet Cream, and some strawberry assistance in there, it might be awesome. **TASK 1**

[White Fluffy Clouds](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/197071) was another. Tastes like... fluffy white clouds. Specifically, fluffy white clouds of thick, creamy, sweetened vanilla milk, with a hint of marshmallow that gets stronger and lingers in the finish. I love the combination of richness and chill vibes from this one. It's relaxing and indulgent at the same time. It goes on the list of favorites that I keep ingredients to make. It might even try to knock [Vanilla Almond Milk](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/2358#vanilla_almond_milk_by_vurve) off its throne as my go-to “Zen” mix. Don't act like you all don't have one of those. It's that recipe that calms you down like a cartoon savage beast being soothed by Bugs Bunny or whoever playing music. I already want to make some more Fluffy White Clouds! **TASK 2**

[BUDDERSTOTCH](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/35021) was the first one to be mixed and the last one to finish steeping but well worth the wait. It's been at least a couple years since I last mixed this nearly six-year-old recipe but it's still every bit as good as I remembered it. I stick to my original review “It's like breathing sweet pipe tobacco through an unlit pipe while a mouthful of butterscotch sundae from DQ melts in your mouth. An amazing take on RY4 that's hard to put down!” Definitely worth continuing to restock CAP French Vanilla and I want to mix some more, maybe just always have some Budderstotch on the self. **TASK 3**

## FLAVORAH

**Rainier Cherry**

**TRASH 1** I don't think this flavor falls above the line of what's even vapable.

It does taste like sweet-tart natural cherry but there's so much of that plastic nightmare stuff along for the ride, especially lingering in the finish and aftertaste, I can't deal with it. Maybe at 0.5% or something it's not so offensive, but there's not enough cherry flavor down at 0.75% for it to really work and it's bad at 0.75%. The cherry flavor to vinyl shower curtain liner off-note ratio is just too wrong for me.

**Raisin Rum**

Tastes like the “raisin rum” flavor of ice cream, without the ice cream, pretty much. Just a little bit more funky or musty than that. FLV really likes their funk sometimes, don't they? I bet they listen to George Clinton over at FLV Headquarters. Anyway, it's a pretty good flavor. Seems like 0.75% to 1% of this plus your favorite ice cream base = rum raisin ice cream. But I'm glad it doesn't have ice cream already added, because it's more versatile that way.

I need it for this [Rum Baba Cake](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/136673#rum_baba_cake_yellow_cake_soaked_with_rum_and_topped_with_coconut_cream_by_mech_mod_rn) that tastes exactly the way the mixer has described it. **TASK 4**

I'm excited to try more.

[Apple and Raisin Strudel](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/228493#apple_and_raisin_strudel_developed2banger_by_azzer). Just two ingredients and this mixer is right, SSA Apple Strudel is almost like cheating. **TASK 5**

I didn't see a rum raisin ice cream that looked like something I wanted to make so I'll make my own. Just by mixing my [vanilla ice cream base](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/215957#1_2_3_vic_by_id10_t) with 1% FLV Raisin Rum. **TASK 6**

And, because I can already picture that being good but needing some extra love, I'll try a second version with the same plus ) 0.5% each VT Red Dates, VT Golden Syrup, and FA Jamaica Rum. **TASK 7**

Also, I see Wayne's using FLV Raisin Rum in RY4s [Honey Raisin RY4](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/191064#honey_raisin_ry4_by_enyawreklaw), [Obsidian v1.2](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/279421#obsidian_v1_2_b_sides_by_enyawreklaw), and [Obsidian v1.3](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/279423#obsidian_v1_3_b_sides_by_enyawreklaw). And I want that. But I don't want those, exactly. I'm going to make my own RY4 with Raisin Rum.

Raisin Rum RY4, V1 **TASK 8**

| Co. | Flavor                   | %    |
| --- | ------------------------ | ---- |
| FLV | Raisin Rum               | 1.25 |
| FLV | Sweet and Smokey Tobacco | 1    |
| FLV | Native Tobacco           | 1    |
| FLV | Turkish Tobacco          | 0.75 |
| WF  | Vanilla Ruyan Custard    | 2    |
| WF  | Salted Caramel           | 2    |
| VT  | Honeycomb                | 1    |

I stole the VT Honeycomb from the Honey Raisin RY4 and the FLV Sweet and Smokey from the Obsidian V1.3. Hopefully that's not some kind of copyright infringement? Whatever, I'm doin it.

**Raspberry**

Just Raspberry, not to be confused with FLV Red Raspberry. FLV Raspberry tastes like raspberry cotton candy drizzled with a little raspberry-scented perfume, though the perfumey aspect isn't nearly as obtrusive at 2% vs. 3% and I might just need to go down even lower on the concentration. FLV Raspberry is mostly an artificial tasting red raspberry candy flavor, with an excess of floral top notes, and a base that's dry yet sweet, like cotton candy or too much ethyl maltol. Also I got some throat scratch at 3% that I didn't notice at 2%.It is very full and flavorful, though.

I'd toss this in favor of several better raspberries but people keep insisting on using sub-par flavors to create amazing things and [Bleeding Berry Cobber](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/66359#bleeding_berry_cobbler_by_tamvapes) is already on the to-try list.

[Raspberry Filled Cookie](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/239284#raspberry_filled_cookie_updated_by_chasing84) looks tempting, too (With JF Cookie instead of FA). **TASK 9**

And so does [A bit fruity!](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/237415#a_bit_fruity_by_chasing84). It might be a muddled fruit mess but it could be a delicious muddled fruit mess, and I want to see which fruits (if any) stand out from that pack. It's as much a research activity as a “trying to find a great FLV-Raspberry recipe” activity. **TASK 10**

**Red Apple**

Potent, accurate, sweet red apple, with a bit of peel on it. Shaper, more flavorful top note. Noticeable throat hit by itself for a red apple, but no more than the average green apple. Somehow fresh with that crisp skin, but also a little dry, or at least not juicy. Crisp. Has some nice body with a depth of apple flavor. Some sugary gritty apple mouthfeel is accurate but a little juiciness somewhere would be nice, unless you're looking for a red apple for tobacco mix, in which case this seems well-suited. Not really tasting anything off at 1% but seems like that peel could get a little grassy or floral if used too high or mixed with the wrong thing. I don't know that I'd try to cook it and use it in a bakery over some of the other options, but if I wanted something like a fruit punch or sangria with bits of apple floating in it, FLV Red Apple seems like it would work really well for that. Or mix it with other apples that are missing that realistic peel but do have some juiciness to them and build a fuller, juicy red apple that way.

I have a couple or three Red Apple recipes that I'm already planning to mix. Will also try this [Red Apple Trinity](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/226166#red_3_2_1_by_sensory_overload). **TASK 11**

**Red Burley**

I don't know what Burley is supposed to taste like, but in my head it's supposed to taste like FLV Red Burley. It's thick, rich, robust, a little dark, and complex, unmistakably tobacco, with notes of wood, peanutty nuttiness, and a touch of cocoa. Woodness is pretty prominent and more oaky than cedar-ish. A little caramelly to malty sweetness, but not too sweet, a little earthy dryness upfront but too rich to really be called dry overall, it's kind of like halfway between pipe tobacco and cigar in terms of moistness, though it otherwise definitely tastes more like the smell of pipe tobacco. No weird chemical or vegetable off notes at all. I seriously think this is one of the best tobacco flavors you could have. Just one thing to be aware of, it has a boomerang effect. It works great as a shake and vape. After a few days, it fades pretty noticeably, though after a couple of weeks or so, it comes back. When it comes back, it's not quite as bold as it was before, and one of the reasons you often see it mixed with other tobaccos is to buttress it.

There are so many recipes I need Red Burley for, and so many that use it that I already have listed to try. We could be here all day. I'm just going to list a few new ones I want to try.

[The Gindra's](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/143131#the_gindra_s_by_thefogvlog). How can just three flavors look so good? **TASK 12**

[Sacrilege](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/202090#sacrilege_by_nickg) For that matter, how can just two? **TASK 13**

[Vertigo](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/143399#vertigo_by_slushy). I wasn't gonna mix just another tobacco vanilla custard, but the addition of coconut makes it interesting. I'll 1:1 sub FW Sweetener for the PUR Super Sweet that I don't have. I'm told FW is weaker in concentration but I'm not a big fan of sucralose with tobacco anyway. **TASK 14**

[A Fist Full of RY4](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/107597#a_fistful_of_ry4_by_amouthforwar). Jesus Christ, it looks like a classic RY4 dessert mix, but with great big hairy tobacco balls. **TASK 15**

**Red Cinnamon**

So that's just Red Hots. Straight up. Extremely potent, 0.25% is full-flavored, full-bodied bright red candy cinnamon. Has a great depth and dense syrupy sweet mouthfeel with a lingering heat. Intense, but nothing chemically or harsh beyond what you'd expect from a red hot candy cinnamon.
But first, I already have punishing myself with [F'n Ice](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/165028#f_n_ice_by_dragonlady) on the schedule. I'm also planning to remix my [recipe that uses TFA Cinnamon Red Hot](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/29425#mango_tango_by_id10_t), mainly for better mangoes, but while we're at it, I plan to upgrade from the TFA Cinnamon Red Hot (no PG) to FLV Red Cinnamon. I get slightly more harshness from the TFA than FLV's Red Cinnamon. I'll mix the next version of that. **TASK 16**

Can't wait to try [Hot Sin Apple](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/194974#hot_sin_apple_by_lionhrt9). When I tried Red Cinnamon for the first time, I thought about playing around with mixing it with apples just like my great-grandma did. She would boil Red Hots candies in water and then simmer cored apple halves in there and serve it with Cool Whip for dessert. I like this idea with apples even better though, caramel-covered apples with red hot cinnamon. **TASK 17**

Or this: [Dracarys - Fiery Apple Lemonade](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/146091#dracarys_fiery_apple_lemonade_by_nickevz). Yeah. That's what it is. Red hot apple lemonade. Oh, and a high amount of WS-23. Probably gonna hurt so good. **TASK 18**

**Red Raspberry**

In some ways, I think this might be the most realistic raspberry flavor I've tried, in some ways, possibly too realistic for its own good. It's not a bright, fresh raspberry. It's more like raspberry jam, but doesn't quite reach the level of jammy sweetness of a jam. The sweetness that's there is dark and it tastes cooked down. I swear there's something woody in the top notes, that makes me think of raspberry pips or seeds, so it's like cooked whole raspberries without the added sugar of a jam. It's also a little on the dry side. And there's a little harshness over 1%, but that's ok because I don't think it needs to be used higher than 1%. FLV Red Raspberry is kind of odd, but it's not floral or chemical at all. By itself it definitely tastes like raspberry, but without that brightness or tartness, it seems like it would do just as well in a boysenberry or even blackberry recipe. It also seems like it could add some realism to an otherwise candy-ish raspberry jam layer.

This [Raspberry jelly filled donut](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/208511#saito_by_wolfwheeler) is already on the list.

I also I need to try this [Raspberry Jam and Croissant](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/95371#raspberry_jam_and_croissant_by_mlnikon) **TASK 19**

This [Lemon Raspberry Crumble Cake](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/243727#lemon_raspberry_crumble_cake_by_mindfloodz) **TASK 20**

This [butter-toffee milkshake with raspberry ribbon](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/278755#nelliel_broken_by_wolfwheeler). **TASK 21**

And [Pennywise](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/292521#pennywise_mwc_coconut_strawberry_by_capiadiy), which is a coconut-strawberry candy. **TASK 22**

**Red Tea**

Full bodied yet wet like tea, thin enough to read beverage, which is great. I've never had the red tea it's supposed to taste like to say whether this thing is accurate but it's both floral and nutty, like some kind of wildflower/pecan hippy tea. It's a bit earthy as well, but yeah, mostly floral and like a field of wildflowers floral, and nutty in a way that leans more toward pecan or walnut than hazelnut or peanut. It's at all not unpleasant to vape but I'll probably never do anything with it. You could say it's just not my cuppa tea. **TRASH 2**

**Red Velvet**

Peanut Butter. It's unusual to get peanut butter as an off-note but if you tried this before and didn't taste peanut butter at all I dare you to try it again and while thinking about PB. It tastes like it's got just a touch of peanut butter in there along with some fluffy, semi-sweet chocolate cake. Not getting any of the cream cheese frosting you'd expect with something called Red Velvet, at all. Really not getting any chocolate cake richness either, that slight peanut butter off note might be the richest thing about it. The cocoa taste is not very pronounced - it's like a touch of cocoa in a cake versus a real chocolately chocolate cake - like an under-chocolated chocolate sponge cake. Really needs some butter for a richer cake, as well as more chocolate, to even be a good chocolate cake, and then you'd have to bring in some frosting to make it Red Velvet and hope that in the process that hint of peanut butter gets covered up. Seems like it would be more at home in a Reese's Puffs cereal recipe than a cake, but even that would need more PB, more chocolate, and cereal, so it might be redundant in that. **TRASH 3**

**Rhubarb**

Really does taste like rhubarb, pretty unmistakably authentic, but also doesn't taste good, at least not to me. Extremely potent. 0.25% tastes like more than enough.. It also tastes a little dirty. There's a nice strong tartness to it, but the earthy and green vegetal qualities really stick out even more. It's not very sweet at all, no more than VG is sweet, but it isn't as overwhelmingly tart as an entirely uncooked, unsweetened rhubarb would be. Like a realistic rhubarb cooked down in a little sugar, but not much, and not all the way cooked, and not washed carefully enough after being picked fresh from the garden. I can definitely see it working, but by itself it's a little hard to vape. Just so earthy/dirty and green. Also a little dry. **TRASH 4**

**Rich Cinnamon**

Extremely potent, to the point that one extra drop can ruin your juice, unless you've made a dilution. This is a perfectly named concentrate, because it has a depth and richness that sets it apart from other cinnamon flavors. It's a full-bodied cinnamon. Like extracting the cinnamon from the gooey stuff inside of a cinnamon roll. It tastes the way cinnamon tastes after it's been baked into something sweet and rich, rather than just raw spice. It's just perfect unless you want a candy cinnamon or a cinnamon-on-top note without any body to it. I guess some balk at the price but it's so concentrated I can't imagine it being less cost-effective than most flavors out there.

The number of recipes I need it for is long and likely growing, as many are already planned to mix.

I need it for [Toasted](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/32619#toasted_by_mrburgundy) **TASK 23** and [Cinnamon Burn Victim](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/111909#cinnamon_burn_victim_by_chemicalburnvictim) **TASK 24** although one day I might choose between one of those two similar recipes to keep all the ingredients for, that day is not today.

And [Deer Lodge](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/90272#deer_lodge_by_concreteriver). **TASK 25**

I need it for [Saturday Morning Macaroon](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/95350#saturday_morning_macaron_by_id10_t) but will try pushing the FA Almond to 3% this time. **TASK 26**

I need it for [Mjuk Pepparkaka](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/206522#mjuk_pepparkaka_by_wallebiela) and that genius LB Lava Cake trick. **TASK 27**

Gonna try:

[Cinnayum](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/229230#c_i_n_n_a_y_u_m_by_sensory_overload) - A cinnamon roll recipe with good looking frosting notes. I'm a little scared of all that Zeppola but if anything can cover Zeppola's weird spice note, I bet FLV Rich Cinnamon can do it. **TASK 28**

**Ripe Mango**

Personally, I prefer (over FLV Ripe Mango) a combo of FLV's Sweet Mango plus any one of a number of other great mango flavors - VT Shisha Mango, FLV's original Mango, FA Indian Mango, for example. But FLV Ripe Mango is FLV's best and most complete single-flavor mango. Nothing here I would call an off note. It's definitely a mango for people who like a more funky, riper mango, but it doesn't cross that line into overripe yucky. It's quite deep and basey. That tropical ripe base is balanced on the top end with a little of a bright, citrus-like top note. It's quite sweet and a little juicy. It's only going to fail to be a single-flavor mango in a mango-centric recipe for people who really need a little of that piney peel-like top note. People who want that are probably still going to want to mix it with a more piney mango. I did get a little throat hit from this one that I don't get with FLV's other mangoes. I wouldn't call it harsh, just on par with a lot of popular peach and citrus flavors. Just something to be aware of.

Already got four or five FLV Ripe Mango recipes in line to be mixed. Adding:

[Mango Nectar](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/221033#mango_nectar_by_mindfloodz). It's just FLV Ripe and Sweet Mangoes with some CAP SS and I could go for that. **TASK 29**

[Low-Tier Tropics](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/240049#low_tier_tropics_by_chumbles). Mango, coconut, pineapple and notes that speak to me: “low effort, low energy, low tier. it's okay to be trash, just like me. we'll get through this together.” **TASK 30**

Speaking of, [1-2-3 Mango Coconut Cake](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/286498#1_2_3_mango_coconut_cake_by_cam9535). I'm going to add an extra 0.5% to that 1,2,3 in the form of FW Sweetener but still, that looks like taking Easy Street to Tasty Town. **TASK 31**

This one says [“Mango Milk Tea + Egg Pudding. Y'all Excited?"](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/263142#megumi_fushiguro_by_wolfwheeler). Yes, yes I am. **TASK 32**

**Root Beer**

I'm aware that for a not-insignificant number of people, FLV Root Beer has too much wintergreen. But, I think it nails that wintergreen note that does stand out in a good root beer. I also think it's the best Root Beer flavor I've tried by far. People say it's top heavy and I get that, but when I say top heavy I'm usually referring to something like what a lot of Real Flavors Super Concentrates did, where much of the flavor is just gone long before the finish. Instead, I'd say this one has a weird little hole in it. Because it finishes beautifully and that finish is what really sets it apart from something like LB Root Beer. It has this light creamy almost foamy lingering finish that calls to mind that thick foamy head on a big mug of root beer; you can almost feel the bubbles in it. It's right before that finish that there's the odd hole in the flavor. This is where it could use some syrupy sweet depth or depending on what you're mixing up, something to fill that hole. Upfront, though, it is also ridiculously vibrant and well balanced, in my opinion. It hits the vanilla better than others, and has a bit of herby sassafras, bittersweet molasses, a touch of spice, and a very subtle licorice taste that belongs there and doesn't stick out obnoxiously like with TFA Root Beer. Bottom line, beware of the hole in this flavor, but other than that, wow!

I will keep mixing [Fitz's](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/67821#fitz_s_by_mrburgundy) until I run out of the discontinued Holy Vanilla, and beyond if I can find a suitable replacement. If I still have some, **TASK 33**

Unless [Barrel Aged Groot Beer](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/265798#cellar_aged_soda_barrel_aged_groot_beer_by_spdrjrslm) is so good it makes me forget about Fitz's. From the look of it, it just might. **TASK 34**

[Frogger](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/223581#frogger_by_stevetc). Kiwi, banana, and root beer? I have to try it. **TASK 35**

There are a bunch of Root Beer Float Recipes but [Blackbeard/Broken](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/270149#blackbeard_broken_by_wolfwheeler) looks like the most well-thought-out one to me. **TASK 36**

Worth noting, I bet this [Bottle Caps](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/306091#bottle_caps_by_rocky02852) recipe is perfectly on-point for root beer bottle caps candies. It's just... I don't really like those so I don't want to vape them.

**Rose Essence**

Watered down sweetened rose water. The kinder, gentler rose flavor. Lacks that strong perfumey floral top note, a bit more base than other roses, but soft, mellow. Also a bit sweet, and not really earthy at all. It's like rose water, or maybe smelling a rose but not actually being in a rose garden in full bloom or stuffing a whole rose into your face hole. It doesn't even have that “concentrated rose water” taste of Turkish Delight, it's more like what a little splash of rose water in a cocktail would taste like. Tastes like this rose could be a bit of a shrinking violet in a mix. Smooth, not harsh like a lot of florals. Probably not the rose flavor for people who REALLY want to taste a rose, but if this flavor was your introduction to florals, you probably wouldn't be scared of florals.

I need this for a few things already mentioned, for a few things already planned to try, and for [Clouds of Buddha](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/151292#clouds_of_buddha_by_kittybit). I've been shying away from FE Sweet Rice recipes because they often steep to blah, but the VT Rice Base in this one saves it. **TASK 37**

**RY4**

This one benefits greatly from a 2-week steep. After one week, I got a mild, dry, nutty, slightly smoky tobacco, with caramel bordering on brown sugar sweetness underneath. Overall, the flavor at 2% was pretty light. Two weeks later: Wow. It's fuller, sweeter and more caramelly underneath that mild, dry, nutty, slightly smoky (with a hint of mocha coffee) tobacco, and a has a much deeper, richer flavor overall. Underneath the tobacco, it's taken on that very rich, extra gooey caramel aspect I was looking for. This is awesome.

I might need it for the chocolate RY4 am working on and will mix whatever version I'm on of that. **TASK 38**

There are at least a dozen recipes with it I wouldn't mind trying, but I'm trying to wrap this up so I've narrowed them down to just one. [Tobacco's Dessert](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/236336#tobacco_s_dessert_by_krawacabana). It's the FA Vanilla Cookie that intrigues me the most but also butterscotch and... apple? Not to mention the effusive reviews. I'll give it that 21-day steep. I got time. **TASK 39**

_Really? All that just to get rid of FOUR flavors? Freakin Flavorah, man. I'll be glad when I get through this company and move down into the ones that put out a lot more trash flavors._

New Flavor Count: 2,554
