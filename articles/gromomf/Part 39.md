TASK OR TRASH - Each flavor gets assigned at least one task or it goes in the trash.

## FLAVORS EXPRESS

**Green Tea**

No bad, mostly green tea, but pretty floral. If I had to name it, I’d say it tastes a bit like wildflowers, maybe the way dandelions smell, but the flower, not dandelion greens. It doesn’t quite taste just like jasmine which is a little more common of a floral to find in tea. So it tastes a little weird, but mostly ok. Floral increases with more concentration, but can be tamed a little with creams. I remember a time when this was the best green tea we could get, way better than TFA or FA green tea flavors. But then Flavorah came out with Eisai Tea. This [Pure Green Tea](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/174925#pure_green_tea_by_donttrusttherabbit) recipe looks great if you really want to vape just straight-up green tea, but since I don’t want to do that, I don’t have a use for FE Green Tea. **TRASH 1**

**Guava**

Tropical red flavor. Tastes like the tropical version of the color red made into a flavor. Thick, heavy, very sticky sweet syrupy flavor. Maybe a guava candy or strawberry-watermelon-guava candy, but not a realistic type of guava. It’s a little tart and there’s a light funkiness to it, enough to lend it a tropical vibe, but still tastes pretty candied. Could be a sweet base for a tropical punch or an enhancer for strawberry, watermelon, or other red fruit hard candy. No throat hit but it does get a little dry at the end after vaping it for a bit. Enough to make me thirsty; tastes like it should be mixed with something juicier, like some Cactus or FA Pear.

I’m excited to try [Crazy Town](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/261697#crazy_town_by_mixnjuice), a 3-ingredient recipe that uses FE Lychee (love) and FLV Cream (love) with FE Guava. **TASK 1**

**Kiwi**

Candish with a distinctly lemony tartness, very sweet, with even a hard candy type of sweet body, but also a little off. Like it’s trying to have a hairspray type of off note but it isn’t quite strong enough or clear enough to be hairspray just yet, it’s just a slight chemical weirdness. Could make a pretty great lemony kiwi candy if that off note is overflavoring at 2%, or it needs a steep, or that could be covered up. I have other kiwis I’d rather use, though. **TRASH 2**

**Lemon**

Probably the best lemon out there or certain uses. It’s a bit sweet and a bit more of a candy lemon standalone but it is a more natural lemon than most of them, and it does two things really well - it mixes well with bakeries - really seems to soak right into them - and IT DOES NOT FADE much or change with steeping. Not harsh. No off notes.

I use it in [Viserion](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/103899#viserion_by_id10_t) but really, with that little of it just to make the blueberries pop a bit more, just about any lemon would do. Also for Long Gone Lonesome Blues. I also need it for Manson & The Pebbles, for and [Blog Day](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/51247#blog_day_remixmonth_by_goldfish18), which is an old favorite I haven’t had in a while. **TASK 2**

Several recipes I already plan to try use it, they are about to be joined by a bunch more. Just look at this stuff!

[Sadboy Butter Cookie](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/225649#sadboy_butter_cookie_blind_remix_developed_by_developed). Creamy lemon filling smashed between two Golden Oreo style cookies. Do Want. **TASK 3**

[Lemon Tart Cheesecake](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/182551#lemon_tart_cheesecake_dinner_lady_remix_by_denske). I love a good lemon bakery and this looks like a good one. **TASK 4**

So does [MlNikon Lemonade Cookies](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/152083#mlnikon_lemonade_cookies_by_mixinvixens), even though it’s just a simple 1-2-3 recipe. **TASK 5**

And this [Lemon Cream Pie](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/223219#lemon_cream_pie_no_steep_the_best_yet_by_slushy) **TASK 6**

[Backwoods Lemonade](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/17882#backwoods_lemonade_by_ediblemalfunction) Forest fruit lemonade, looks like an oldie but a goodie, especially in summer. **TASK 7**

[1-2-3 Forest Blueberry Mix](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/179954#simple_1_2_3_forest_blueberry_mix_by_seltzgenius) is another simple recipe using both FE Lemon and FA Forest Fruit, this time with TFA Blueberry Wild. **TASK 8**

[Blushing Lady](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/175179#blushing_lady_by_ruderudi) another three-ingredient recipe with FE Lemon, the other two are INW Grapefruit and FA Pomegranate. That FA Pom can be tricky but I bet it’s great in this one. **TASK 9**

This [Lemon-Lime Cactus](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/211085#schnobi_s_calime_by_schnobster) looks like it might be a great refreshing summer vape, too, if the cactus isn’t too much. **TASK 10**

[Simple Lemonade](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/217886#simple_limon_adv_by_ex_bartend3r). It’s just VT FIzzy Sherbet, FE Lemon, and some CAP SS. But that sounds simply delightful to me. **TASK 11**

[Dumbledore](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/84791#dumbledore_bearded_no_1_by_dazcole). Another one that uses both VT Fizzy Sherbet and FE Lemon, this one in a sweet-and-sour lemon candy. **TASK 12**

And other with those two flavors, plus sour apple. Sour apple lemonade. [Pucker Butt Lemonade](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/209169#pucker_butt_lemonade_by_eyemsam). **TASK 13**

And of course, another blue razz recipe. [Razul](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/234455#razul_by_ninedimensions) - I’m really interested in how the CAP HIbiscus and CAP Sweet Candy work with this combo of blue razz flavors. **TASK 14**

**Lemonade**

Weirdly warm sweet lemon. Like that kind of weird warmth that makes you check to see if you’ve accidentally bumped your wattage up. Not sure what’s up with that. Also something like a vague, soft spice note to it. It’s not bad tasting to me, but it’s not what I want from lemonade, either. **TRASH 3**

**Lychee**

This is actually my favorite lychee. I’ve had a lychee hard candy from Taiwan that I’m certain was made out of this. The flavor was identical. Very subtle rosy floral upfront, sugary sweet flatter more artificial base with a subtle funky ripeness to that white grape plus grapefruit tartness that lychee does. Strong, punchy flavor. I’m not sure if there’s actually some hard candy body here or if it’s just my mind playing tricks on me because of how much this tastes like that lychee candy. But it’s even sweeter than more syrupy flavors. Drier floral at first, but overall mouthwatering. Very bold, full-flavored.

Love it. It’s in a couple of things I already plan to mix. Really excited to try this [Lychee Candy](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/285804#yachiru_kusajishi_by_wolfwheeler) recipe too, it looks fantastic. **TASK 15**

If the combination of CAP Sweet Lychee and FE Lychee isn’t a lychee overdose, I bet this [Lychee Apple Hard Candy](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/298434#lychee_apple_hard_candy_by_dippindabbin) is great, too. **TASK 16**

**Mango**

Fades very badly. At first it’s funky, juicy, complex, and most of all very vibrant and pretty much perfect. Unfortunately after just a few days it starts changing from this super vibrant mango flavor to something duller and flatter, shedding all of those bright top notes and even some of the funkier ones and basically leaving behind a dull slightly tropical mediocre peach. I don’t know the science behind why this works, but I’ve had it stick around a bit more in a mix with creamy things than without, but it still loses much of what makes it so great at first and as such I can’t recommend using it, unless you’re after an amazing mango shake and vape and aren’t making more than you can vape in a couple of days; in which case, grab some of this and mix it up at 2.5%, it’s really good. No task or trash with this one, it’s not included in my original flavor count because I used it all up and decided not to replace it before starting this flavor-hoarding recovery process.

**Melon**

I don’t think I’ve tried this one yet. Will mix a 2% sample and see what it’s about. **TASK 17**

**Meringue**

Does not taste like meringue. Sugary sweet but has a butter flavor under it that tastes a kinda fakey, like butter mixed with a little movie theater popcorn butter. Thick, creamy mouthfeel, very smooth. Not dry, almost oily with the butter. Lingering sweetness. FE meringue tastes like it might make a better, less waxy replacement for CAP Butter Cream at a lower % than the 2.5% I tried it at. Say 1%.But I did not see a recipe that used it that way - or any way for that matter - and because of that fakey butter taste, I’m not sticking my neck out for it. **TRASH 4**

**Migua (Honey Dew)**

This one is interesting. Not interesting in a bad way, but more of an I’m not sure what to do with this way. Sweet candy honeydew flavor with no real sense of juiciness. Really top heavy flavor in a sense, with all the honeydew packed right up front, comes across as artificial but not in an offensive or unpleasant way, on top of a very sweet but bland sort of candy body. The sweetness is really interesting here. It’s heavy, dense, and sticky feeling like hard candy, different from cotton candy or sucralose sweetness. Somewhere between syrup and hard candy, really quite sugary without having the grit of raw sugar. Bit of a dry finish versus the juiciness you probably want from a honeydew, but more sticky dry than full on Sahara desert dry. Can’t find a good-looking recipe that uses it, I’m going to let it go. **TRASH 5**

**Mile Seven**

Tastes more like a recipe than a single flavor, very complex. Unlike many other nutty tobaccos that are mostly nut, this one has a fairly good balance of roasted peanut and mild, generic tobacco. But I also get hints of caramel, vanilla, and chocolate. Lots of flavor from top to bottom, very full-bodied. I could have a lot of fun with this, like by enhancing the tobacco and boosting one of those accents, could probably make a delicious three-flavor sweet tobacco recipe out of this. My first thought is FLV Red Burley to play on both the nuttiness and the chocolate while driving the tobacco home, but a caramel or vanilla tobacco or separate tobacco and vanilla or caramel flavors would play well too.

There is seriously not a single recipe on ATF using this super-interesting flavor? Ok. I’ll mix something simple and think about where to take it from there. In the meantime, people who like INW 555 Gold need to get on this.

Mile Seven Experiment V1 **TASK 18**

| Co. | Flavor     | %    |
| --- | ---------- | ---- |
| FLV | Red Burley | 1.75 |
| FE  | Mile Seven | 2    |

**Milk Chocolate**

Comes pretty close to milk chocolate. Lighter milk chocolate flavor, thick creamy feel. Very sweet, noticeably sweet above and beyond the sweetener put in my base for testing this. Some issues - it just isn’t super flavorful, and has a very slight chemical taste at 2%. Four percent brings out that chemical unbearably and makes that sweetness run a little fruity, 1% is just weak. 2% is too weak to pull off all the milk chocolate flavor of something like a candy bar, but maybe it could help move a darker chocolate flavor into more of a milk chocolate direction?

All five of the recipes currently on ATF that use it are by the same mixer, Sorteal. I’m going to try the three of them that look best to me.

[3rd Wheel V2](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/253700#3rd_wheel_v2_by_sorteal) I get a strong hazelnut taste from MB Glamour Chocolate but the Peanut Butter in there might swallow it up, and this one has a couple of shining reviews. **TASK 19**

[Angelic Toffee](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/261019#angelic_toffee_by_sorteal) this one not so much for anything I see in the recipe but for the food it’s based on - torn angel food cake mixed with whipped cream and crushed chocolate-covered toffee bars. Get in my belly! **TASK 20**

And [Chocolate Overdose Custard V2](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/298385#chocolate_overdose_custard_v2_by_sorteal) which looks like an improvement from V1 and appears to have been obsessed over to the point that it’s got to be good. **TASK 21**

**Oak Milk**

Y’all. This stuff is delicious. Maybe not “go to Flavor Jungle and buy it right this second” delicious, but if you’re already buying stuff at Flavor Jungle or some other place that sells it, definitely pick some up.

I’m not sure what “Oak Milk” is supposed to taste like, but FE Oak Milk mostly tastes like thick, rich, sweetened condensed milk, but it also has a fairly prominent soft caramel to it. Like you started making dulce de leche out of sweetened condensed milk and stopped halfway through. There might be something a little oaky hanging about in the background of that caramel top note, or that might be the power of suggestion from the name. The base is really clearly sweetened condensed milk, and then a softer caramel comes back in the finish and lingers. It’s thick and extremely rich and silky smooth, without any kind of butyric yuckiness.

I found FE Oak Milk to be a fairly complex concentrate that’s pretty satisfying even as a single flavor, but it seems like a lot of fun could be had with it. The caramel makes me want to do a creamy RY4 type of recipe. But it also seems like it would be good with any kind of fruit in a fruit and cream situation, or part of milkshake, or malt since that thing that might be wood tastes a little malty, or mix with nuts or chocolate. This plus VT Devon Cream and a little VT Chocolate Mousse would be amazing. I could also see putting some vanilla and bourbon flavors with this and using it to make something like a bourbon cream sauce. It’s just really, really delicious.

I already plan to mix [The Baker’s Pipe](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/292531#baker_s_pipe_by_dippindabbin). Happily adding [Just Search Ass](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/255939#just_search_ass_by_danielthevapeman) to the list. **TASK 22**

**Oatmeal N Milk**

This needs a steep. Even a week in, it’s alcoholic. It’s thick and rich but there’s more than a little alcohol in there that did not steep out over a week. Freshly mixed, it tasted like taking a shot half-vodka half-oatmeal with heavy cream and sugar. After a week, I still get a trace of alcohol. Other than that, it tastes sort of like oatmeal with lots of milk, more milk than oats really, and the oats are maybe a little overcooked and lacking texture beyond thickness. They’re also a little...the word that comes to mind is “gamey.” It tastes like it could be great in a cereal and milk recipe with the cereal flavor providing the texture (after a long steep). I wouldn’t use it as an oatmeal when there are other oat flavors as options. **TRASH 6**

**Passion Fruit**

Sweet passionate dryer sheets. Candy sweet but with a somewhat bitter floral top note. Fresh passion fruit should be a little floral, but this is a bit too much and also not quite right. Nectary sweetness, thinner than syrupy. A lot like sweetened and watered down passion fruit juice or thin passion fruit syrup mixed with some sweet guava nectar. Much less tartness than it should have. Instead, where more acidic tartness should be, there’s a bit of a perfumey floral that kind of reminds me of FA Summer Clouds (aka FA Dryer Sheets) but not so oppressive and blatantly dryer sheet-y as that and not something that would keep me from trying a recipe that uses it. Some mild throat hit, but nothing like FA Passion Fruit (aka FA Throat Razors). It’s not a bad flavor, but it’s definitely one I can live without. **TRASH 7**

**Rainbow Sherbet**

Tastes a bit like Rainbow sherbet, but mostly like tart and sweet raspberry-orange candy with a considerably floral top note and weird bitter sort of chemical or medicinal finish. There’s a bright, tart raspberry upfront that goes floral or perfumey as raspberries can do, at least at 2% after steeping for almost a week. After that it’s just citrus, mostly orange.

There’s supposed to be lemon in FE Rainbow Sherbet according to Flavor Jungle and I don’t really taste lemon, but the orange is more tart than it should be and I guess that’s a lemon? There’s not really a creaminess here. The orange is full-bodied right after that raspberry but the finish thins out and is a bit sweet and dry. And weird. It finishes weird, like with the bitterness of a floral perfume without that much of the actual perfume taste, more like medicine. It’s not fun.

Maybe you could fix it with some cream flavor, like maybe Vanilla Swirl will eat FE Rainbow Sherbet’s sin, but I don’t know, and I’m not going to stick around to find out. **TRASH 8**

**RY4**

Correct me if I’m wrong, but isn’t RY4 supposed to be caramel-vanilla-tobacco? This one tastes much more like a caramel-nut-tobacco, but the caramel is a bit sharp and raw brown sugary, not especially rich or creamy. Vanilla is present but not creamy, more like a slight hint of darker vanilla bean. The tobacco is extremely nutty, like roasted toasted nuttiness, and that makes up more of the body of this flavor than the caramel. Overall I really like this flavor, it finishes quite drier than some of the others in the RY4 category, but I’m ok with that in a tobacco vape, and it still manages to be rather smooth. 4% seems to really be pushing some of the raw brown sugar here and I’m thinking it probably fares better at 2 or 3%. Anyway, it’s a pretty good flavor, but there are three recipes on ATF that use it, one has a flavor I don’t have in it. The other two both otherwise look good to me but contain a level of FLV Connecticut Shade I’m not comfortable with.

However, FE RY4 and the Super Concentrates (SC) RY4 that used to be sold by Bull City are the same thing, and this [Coastal Wolf](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/248088#coastal_wolf_by_uonlyvapeonce) vanilla custard tobacco that calls for SC RY4 looks fantastic. **TASK 23**

**RY4 Double**

Tastes more like caramel coffee than caramel tobacco, and it’s a little green, like extra extra light roast coffee or maybe half coffee/half green tea. Sticky-sweet caramel and light vanilla is at least half of the equation, but that green coffee thing, while not terribly off-putting, is very odd. I’m so close to tossing this, but here’s a recipe harnessing that coffee aspect: [PSL](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/242214#psl_live_mixing_by_enyawreklaw). I don’t expect it to be a “keeper” because it’s a “live mixing” thing and not a recipe meticulously crafted over time, but I really want to see how that worked out. **TASK 24**

**Strawberry**

Perfectly serviceable but fairly boring strawberry. Reminds me of FW Strawberry except more concentrated. Tastes fairly natural but again there’s that out of season or heat lamp strawberry that just doesn’t have that much flavor, with just a little artificial bump to it. Has a tartness to it -- also similar to FW Strawberry but a little sharper and less soft than FW’s - but similarly doesn’t have a lot of other complexity. It isn’t a very deep flavor but isn’t top heavy, it’s more just in the middle, without much of that brighter top note or ripe, juicy depth. **TRASH 9**

**Sun Seeds**

Overly sweet, under-roasted, and only almost salty, but otherwise tastes like sunflower seeds. The top note tastes like kind of green but not quite raw shelled sunflower seeds. Base is where it gets overly sweet and more of an indistinct, almost creamy nut flavor more than the distinctive seedy top note. Saltiness is there but light, more of an impression than actual saltiness, and more in the aftertaste than the vape.

There’s only one recipe with it that interests me, this [chocolate peanut butter](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/129192#chocolate_nut_butter_by_ebc88), but the problem with that one is that it’s 4 years old and I can’t remember if that means the old LB Lava Cake or the new one, and at 3%, I’m pretty sure that matters. Tempted to steal liberally from that recipe to make my own chocolate PB, and I still might eventually, when it comes to using it at an additive level like that, I don’t believe FE Sun Seeds can do anything that FLV Beer Nuts can’t do better. **TRASH 10**

**Sweet Bread Crust**

Mostly tastes like peeling the crusty outside off a baked Kings Hawaiian roll. Like those rolls are great just out of the bag, but this is the crust from one that’s been put in the oven until the outside is a little crisp. Essentially, the perfect top note for something like a bread pudding. Not yeasty, the only “off” note I’m getting is a light and pleasant but weirdly dark, chocolatey caramel in the finish, like a very watered down melted Rolo. I know from two recipes I tried that it can be covered up fairly easily, as neither of the recipes have any hint of chocolate, though I kinda wanna lean in to that and hit it with some VT Devon Cream and maybe another chocolate, WF Salted Caramel, and come buttery custard like FA Custard Premium and see if I can do like a chocolate bread pudding with salted caramel sauce. But, that sounds like a lot of work, and I’m not sure I’m up to it.

This [Bread Puddn V3](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/156624#bread_puddn_v3_live_mixing_by_enyawreklaw) recipe by Enyawreklaw is, believe it or not, awesome. I think I can make it even better, though. Going to swap the CAP Super Sweet out for FW Sweetener, same amount, and drop in 0.1% FLV Rich Cinnamon. **TASK 25**

**Sweet Grape**

There’s a crisp, slightly tart but very sweet white grape underneath there, but it initially and mostly tastes like I’d just been vaping hair gel. I can’t remember the brand, but back when I had hair I definitely used a hair gel that smelled exactly like 75% of this flavor. Mix it with some white grape juice and you have this. Graham (RIP) once said it was the worst flavor he’d ever tried and was more offensive than a Hitler action figure. I’m much more offended by barf flavor than weird chemical off notes so I’m not going to say it’s anywhere near the worst. But it ain’t good. **TRASH 11**

**Sweet Orange**

It’s a vibrant and juicy mandarin orange, I personally love this one. It also tastes like canned mandarin oranges more than it tastes like anything, but at the same time it does have some orange peel and zest in the top notes, though they’re understated. The body is very sweet, like canned mandarins in syrup, but still bright. It’s little thin at 4% but starts to get a little waxy to me at 5%. It’s smooth for a citrus. Tried working with it quite a bit and had trouble with it not showing up behind other ingredients as much as I want it to, and with it needing help in the thickness department to actually pass as juice, but it certainly tastes great compared to a lot of other mandarins, oranges, and tangerines.

Already planning to try [3 days 2 nights](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/69328#3_days_2_nights_by_thadentman) that uses it. I love the idea of a [POG Milkshake](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/263687#pog_god_og_passion_orange_guava_milkshake_by_alch3m1st) but couldn’t possibly enjoy that because of the TFA VBIC pepper thing. Instead I’ll take a recipe a made a couple years back, [Creamsquat](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/208695#creamsquat_by_id10_t) that’s dead now due to no lemon mix, and see what happens if I replace the Kumquat 3.75% and INW Lemon Mix 0.25% with 4% FE Sweet Orange for a more traditional but still coconut-milk-based dairy free vanilla filling orange creamsicle. It if blends too much (Kumquat and Lemon Mix were great at separating from cream into a distinct layer) I’ll probably just have a tasty orange-coconut-vanilla mess on my hands, and that’s ok. Might go back and add some passionfruit and guava later. **TASK 26**

**Sweet Rice**

Freakishly authentic fragrant plain white rice, like jasmine rice, for a week or so, then devolves into much more of a bland starchy body like a stale flour tortilla. Before devolving, nice rice texture on top, finish is quite creamy but still rice-tasting. Very thick, full mouthfeel even while the flavor is more subtle, again accurate to rice.

Mixing with VT Rice Base helps with the fading issue considerably.

I need it for [Clouds of Buddha](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/151292#clouds_of_buddha_by_kittybit). I also love the idea behind [Broke Breakfast](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/51300#broke_breakfast_sweet_rice_milk_w_yeo_layer_by_gachatay), because been there, ate that. Still miss it sometimes. But I think I can do it better than that. Also my family wasn’t quite as broke as Gachatay’s apparently, we got a little pat of butter on our hot rice before pouring milk over it.

My Broke Breakfast V1 **TASK 27**

| Co. | Flavor        | %    |
| --- | ------------- | ---- |
| FE  | Sweet Rice    | 4.5  |
| VT  | Rice Base     | 1.25 |
| FA  | Meringue      | 0.75 |
| FA  | Milk          | 1.25 |
| FA  | Cream Fresh   | 1    |
| VT  | Butter Base   | 0.75 |
| FLV | Rich Cinnamon | 0.13 |
| FW  | Sweetener     | 0.5  |

**Sweet Strawberry**

Weird, darkly sweet strawberry with a strange funky sort of tropical flavor. Full flavored but almost overripe, while at the same time fairly simple without too much else going on, almost like a candy flavor in its simplicity. Not a clue what to do with this stuff unless mixing with a tropical flavor that isn’t funky enough. **TRASH 12**

**Turkish**

Very vague and very light spice notes, light to medium tobacco base, and just a touch of brown sugary sweetness. Woody, with some nutty tones. Peanut, specifically. Like tobacco mixed with peanut shells. Pretty solid amount of flavor at 2%. Pretty good depth, medium thickness. Can’t say I enjoyed it a whole lot by itself but I certainly wouldn’t hesitate to mix a tobacco recipe that uses it. Unfortunately, I did not see one. **TRASH 13**

**Whipped Cream**

Terrible. It tastes like whipped cream, but also tastes like it has lemon dish soap in it. If you’ve ever used Lemon Joy to hand wash dishes, it’s a pretty recognizable thing. Tastes like I wanted to make vanilla whipped cream with two tsps of vanilla but I only had one tsp of vanilla, so I subbed in Lemon Joy for one of the tsp because I was dropped on my head and fed lead-based paint chips as a child. I can’t understand how this gets manufactured and sold to people, it’s so bad. **TRASH 14**

## FLAVOUR ART

**7 Leaves Ultimate**

Woody, dry tobacco, very light spice, like an autumn spice with the slightest hint of anise, not enough to be licorice-y. It’s not perfumy, but it’s kinda cologne-y in that wood and spice combination and hint of tobacco, kinda tastes like it could be a men’s cologne. The woodiness is similar to sandalwood but not exactly sandalwood. It’s definitely not pine or oak, though. Very distinctly brown sugar sweetness. That’s mostly what I get, wood and brown sugar, with spice. Not much tobacco really, just a leafy hint of it..

I need it for [Chem Twista Lime](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/102517#chem_twista_lime_by_chemicalburnvictim). **TASK 28**

**Almond**

Definitely not trash. If you forced me to keep only one FA flavor, it would probably be this one. It’s a clear, clean, almond flavor. It mostly tastes like a raw almond. Slightly sweet and extracty, but dry, rich, and woody enough to come across as the actual nut in a mix, while being smooth enough to be the almond taste in almond milk. Medium body, not thin and top heavy. Rich and creamy but not too thick and basey either. It really is the quintessential and most essential almond flavor and it can be used in so many ways. If you don’t have FA Almond already, get it now.

I need it for a bunch of favorite recipes, such as Mango Blossom Macaron, Vanilla Almond Milk, Saturday Morning Macaron, Big Papa’s Macaron, Blog Day, Goddaron, Stoned Alone, Dummies, and Sandy Pineapple, not to mention a dozen or so new-to-me recipes I already plan to try.

Here’s a couple more that look too good to pass up:

[High Society](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/144699#high_society_butter_almond_custard_tobacco_by_slushy). Butter. Almond. Custard. Tobacco. Going to sub FW Sweetener for the PUR. **TASK 29**

[Spandauer](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/158537#spandauer_danish_puff_pastry_by_kittybit). Danish puff pastry. **TASK 30**

**Amarula**

I don’t know what Amarula is supposed to actually taste like, but this one can best be described in a word as “interesting.” It’s very rich and creamy, with a flavor that reminds me of Irish Cream with that slight mocha coffee-type note, but it also some really bright, citrusy grapefruit-esque thing going on, just thinly laid over the heavy cream. It tastes like something you couldn’t enjoy in real life because the acid would curdle the cream and make it nasty. It also tastes like FA Irish Cream and FA Grapefruit mixed together. It’s a little boozy, but not at all strongly so. No clue what the heck to do with it, but it’s interesting. There’s not a single recipe on ATF that uses it, so this seems like a good chance for me to go ahead and expunge something weird from my stash. **TRASH 15**

**Anise**

Brighter, spicier anise with some woody accents and a light but almost creamy base. No off notes. If I saw a recipe using this that I really wanted to try, I’d keep it, but seeing none, **TRASH 16**

**Apple Pie**

I really just get pie crust from it. No apple. Just the slightest bit of fruity sweetness. No spice, not really, maybe they like wave some cinnamon over the vat of the stuff at FA HQ but don’t actually drop it in. But it’s a really solid pie crust, probably the most solid. It’s strong and shows up in a mix and tastes like buttery if a bit doughy crust. Very full and dense crust, no off notes, just missing ones.

I need it for my [1-2-3 Butter Pecan Pie](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/132750#1_2_3_butter_pecan_pie_by_id10_t). **TASK 31**

But I will be mixing that and tasting it with the intention of trying to make it better, and this [Butter Pecan Crumble](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/288635#butter_pecan_crumble_by_kuri_santou) looks like about where I would have wound up, so I’ll go ahead and try that and see if improving Butter Pecan Pie is something I still need to do or something that’s already been done for me. **TASK 32**

Also, here’s a recipe that specifically states that the mixer has already done that for me, so of course I have to try [Butter Tarts](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/141193) - it looks amazing. **TASK 33**

I have already planned to mix other recipes that use this, too.

**Apricot**

Very nice, authentic apricot. It’s one that everyone should probably own. It tastes much more natural than candied and not overly sweet. Top notes are mild, subtle yellow peachy-type of flavor. Pushing it higher doesn’t really make it less weak, it’s just a gentle type of fresh fruit flavor. A little dry, or at least not especially juicy, but not too dry. Of note, I’m aware some people think it is aggressive and does stand out in a mix, but I’ve never had that issue using it with bold fruits. Not a dried or cooked type of flavor at all. I don’t get any sort of harshness from this, overall it’s just a smooth and gentle flavor. Its exhale starts and finishes weaker: it’s more of a middle-range flavor, with a nice full fleshy body like you’d expect from a fresh apricot. Hence why I like to use it to help fill out various other stone fruits - peaches, plums, nectarines, cherries - and it even works for some tropical fruits like mango and papaya. It’s not very aggressive or prone to standing out too much in mix with other fruits, in my experience, although I’ve had a tobacco recipe that used it at 1% and I didn’t think it would show up at all, but it definitely did. . So, mixed results. Works especially well with flavors that have their own aggressive top notes and you want to make it a fuller bodied fruit without pushing those flavors higher and getting more harshness or having them run floral on you, like peaches, or for filling out a cherry without letting it get too mediciny if you want a fresh natural cherry flavor.

I need it for [Counter Punch](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/154364#counter_punch_by_id10_t) **TASK 34**

[Impropapiety](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/113012#impropapiety_by_id10_t) (papaya sweet tea recipe I created) **TASK 35**

[Apricaught Me Slippin](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/54094#apricaught_me_slippin_by_chemicalburnvictim) (the aforementioned apricot 1% tobacco recipe) **TASK 36**

And a couple of other favorites that were added to the to-mix list too recently to repeat just yet.

I also want to try [Cookie-On-Me](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/235999#cookie_on_me_by_davidn2kl),. A fruit-filled cookie recipe that has some of my favorite ingredients in it - with the exception of FA Cookie (I’ll just JF Cookie instead) and CAP Super Sweet (which I’ll replace with FW Sweetener because 0.5% CAP SS seems like a lot for a cookie recipe). **TASK 37**

**Arctic Winter**

It’s just menthol. The only reason I would keep it over any other just plain menthol is a recipe using it that I want to make, since I’m not exactly sure how much of a different menthol to sub in.

Unfortunately for my getting rid of flavors project, there is one such recipe: [Spiral Out](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/170394#spiral_out_by_ediblemalfunction), an orange, papaya, menthol mix. **TASK 38**

**Aurora**

Heavy, realistic lime zest top end with some bitterness and a much softer but sweet, limeade-type body that almost feels effervescent. Perfect for the “twist of lime” in a cocktail because of that zesty lime and sweeter body.

I need this for something I’m working on. I also want to try [Strawora Limealis](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/145022#strawrora_limealis_by_humanpuck), though I imagine that if I love it I’ll soon be trying it again with a rum flavor or two or FLV Tequila Agave added to it. **TASK 39**

And [Peyote](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/183028#peyote_by_selev), which looks weird. But it might be amazing weird. **TASK 40**

**Banana**

Very typical FA Flavor. Realistic, sightly underripe banana, all thin, dry top notes with essentially no creamy base at all. 1 to 2%, beyond that, overly dry to the point of added throat hit,, also candyish, but not in a good way like LA or TFA Banana Cream, because that underipeness also ramps up and just gets weird. Also, at 3%, it tastes almost like there’s a bit of clove in here. Sounds like a negative review, but I actually used to love 1.25ish % of this on top of TFA Banana Cream because it creates a more realistic banana. The problem is that we have quite a few better bananas now. I think I’ll be ok without this one **TRASH 17**

**Banana Candy**

When WF came out with a banana candy, I really appreciated the embracing of the candy, since so many other bananas taste like banana runts or banana laffy taffy but don’t just come right out and admit it. But then Chef’s Super Concentrates (RIP) comes out with one that’s super potent and spot-on banana runts but the “at least they’re honest about it” novelty starts to wear off. Then FA’s comes out and by now, I’m not interested in candy banana. But there’s nothing wrong with this one. It tastes very much like those banana puffy candies, but with a little less punch of flavor than those have. If you’re really into those foamy banana candies you might want to pick this one up, but I don’t feel a need for it personally. **TRASH 18**

I promise updates next week. Things are steeping.
