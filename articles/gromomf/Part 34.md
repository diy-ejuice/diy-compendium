TASK OR TRASH - Each flavor gets assigned at least one task or it goes in the trash.

## FLAVORAH

**Papaya Punch**

Personally, I find this flavor delightful to vape. It’s a full and deeply saturated fruity flavor. But it tastes more like a strange tropical version of peach rings candy than a papaya, an artificial-tasting peach, and even has a deep gummy candy body to it. Peach rings with some melony tropical funk to it. Maybe papaya rings, but not a fresh natural fruit. It seems like it might be a little too tropical work as part of a peach gummy recipe, but it seems like it might be a terrific base for just all kinds of tropical gummy candy recipes. Mango comes to mind first, but adding another papaya flavor could make it more clearly papaya, and it seems like pineapple, guava, passionfruit - any of those might work.

No one has used this the way I wanted them to so I’ll try mixing up something my damned self.

Mango Gummy V1 **TASK 1**

| Co. | Flavor       | %   |
| --- | ------------ | --- |
| FA  | Indian Mango | 2   |
| FLV | Sweet Mango  | 1   |
| FLV | Papaya Punch | 1.5 |
| WF  | Peach Gummy  | 2   |
| CAP | Super Sweet  | 0.5 |

Will also try a couple of Slushy’s recipes:

[Space Punch V2](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/215096#space_punch_v2_flavorah_by_slushy) looks like a smooth and creamy mango-forward fruity mess that I would love. **TASK 2**

[Diablo Kiss](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/139875#diablo_kiss_by_slushy) looks like a creamy banana and guava fruity mess that I would love, with FW Sweetener in for the PUR that I don’t have. **TASK 3**

**Passion Fruit**

Boring for something with passion in the name. Slightly tart and bitey passionfruit top note, but thin and a little dull and dry, not juicy at all. Not much base to it but what’s there is more earthy than funky. It’s identifiable as a passionfruit but not quite right because of the dryness and dullness, just not a very deeply saturated flavor at all. Might be a good backup in some kind of tropical fruit lemonade but it’s not going to be the main flavor. It’s not juicy, it’s not all that sweet and funky, and if it’s not any of those things, what is good for, really? Also, the throat hit seems excessive to me for the amount of flavor actually coming out of this.

I can name off five better passion fruit flavors easily, and nobody has made anything out of it that I feel like trying. **TRASH 1**

**Pastry Zest**

It tastes like lightly citrus laced and very lightly spiced laced donut frosting.

When it comes to creating recipes, I would have been fine without Pastry Zest ever existing. But that doesn’t mean people haven’t used it to make amazing things. It’s in Develop’s [Apple Fritter](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/138459#apple_fritter_developed_by_developed) that I already plan to mix. I’ll try [mlNikon’s Lemon Bar](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/140438#mlnikon_s_lemon_bar_by_mixinvixens), too, it looks perfect. **TASK 4**

**Peach**

It’s a very natural-tasting yellow peach, you can almost taste the rosy blush on it. Just perfectly ripened and perfectly sweet. It’s not especially thick but does have some fullness to the peach body. It’s not juicy, but it’s also not dry, and I do not get any floral or other off-notes. It does sort of taste like it has peel on it, which serves to increase the authenticity. It is kind of soft, not a really bold flavor despite being highly concentrated. This peach is often recommended to people who can’t vape other peaches due to harshness. And I can see why - it’s very smooth for a peach. I do get a little scratch from it but it’s different from the other peaches. Instead of building and getting worse and worse the more I vape, I get it right at the start and then get used to it and don’t really notice it anymore.

I’ve yet to try a recipe that made me think FLV Peach was something I wouldn’t be fine without, but that’s probably just because I haven’t tried the right one yet.

[Princess Peach](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/189235#princess_peach_live_mixing_diy_ejucie_discord_collaborative_mix_by_diy_discord) Peach soda! **TASK 5**

[SSDD](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/257749#ssdd_by_cam9535). Simple peach-apple mix. Dat SSA Nectarines. **TASK 6**

Or possibly one of these Peaches & Cream recipes.

[Peaches & Cream](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/160230#peaches_cream_by_vensyboy) has me a little concerned because 3% FW Yogurt instead of the usual 1 or 2% but it definitely looks worth a try. **TASK 7**

I don’t know what the 1% each of two strawberry flavors are doing in there but the cream mix on this [Peach Vanilla Cream](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/217237#peach_vanilla_cream_by_cloudhugger) looks terrific, and I like the idea of FLV Peach and FA White Peach together. **TASK 8**

**Peach Gummy**

When it comes to peach gummies, I prefer WF Frog Gummy and WF Peach Gummy - but the peach in those is wrong for any peach gummy I’ve ever eaten. And I feel like if you’re buying a flavor called “Peach Gummy,” you’re probably looking for peach rings like me when I’m high, and the FLV version is pretty much peach rings. It does have the right peach top note for that, and it also has some nice gummy candy body. Just throw some sweetener in with it and be good to go. If I have to nitpick, it could maybe use a more punchy peach - probably adding some INW Peach or FA White Peach or just about any peach ought to do it. It could also stand to be a little thicker or chewier but some marshmallow or vanilla swirl might provide that. Basically whatever you think it needs, it doesn’t need much of it if you want peach O’s. Does have some mild throat hit for me, maybe 3 or 4 out of 10 on a throat scale.

[The Ringer](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/68857#the_ringer_by_mrburgundy) looks like the perfect peach rings recipe from where I sit. **TASK 9**

[Jin](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/277885#jin_by_wolfwheeler). Blueberry-Peach Creamsicle. I don’t think that’s a real thing, but it should be. **TASK 10**

**Peanut Butter**

I like this one better by itself than in a mix after even dozens of tries to make it work as either a primary peanut butter or support for TFA’s Peanut Butter. First of all, it tastes more like skin-on roasted redskin peanuts than peanut butter. It’s not sweet or smooth enough for PB. And that slightly bitter, dark roasted skin has so far stood out more in a mix for me versus single flavor tests that make it seem like it would be easy enough to cover up. Nice body, accurate flavor for roasted peanuts, just not really a peanut butter flavor, and all the tricks tried to make it creamier and sweeter, such as adding some marshmallow etc, just seem to make that roasted peanut skin note stick out even further. Seems like it would be good for something like a Cracker Jacks recipe, or, because of the way it stays separate from a mix, peanut topping for something like a sundae, but there are better ingredients for both of those. I’m tired of messing with FLV Peanut Butter. **TRASH 2**

**Pear**

This one is fairly unique and could be extremely useful, but is also a little gross. It mostly just tastes like a pear with just a little bit of a regurgitated pear note, like burping mid-way through eating a pear. It has un-pear-alleled texture when it comes to that kind of gritty mouthfeel that pears and apples have. It’s sweet and natural and not quite juicy but at least moist. As a single flavor the burpy off note in FLV Pear is pretty off putting at 1%, less so at 0.75%, and missing at 0.5%, but there’s not a lot of flavor at 0.5% either. So, it might not be great for a solo pear flavor, but if you drop to down to 0.5% or less you can get it to impart that unique texture without getting the actual pear flavor or the burpy off-note. That texture doesn’t have to be used for a pear, either. I’ve had a “Mango Sorbet” recipe both with and without FLV Pear at 0.5% and it really made a huge difference as far as that body and texture of a sorbet. I’d classify this not as a good pear flavor, but as a great sort of “advanced mixing” tool. I’m good without burpy pear and it’s mealy body, though, since I lack the DF Pear to mix [this pear recipe](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/191773#ap_pear_antly_by_cinn). I’m pre-pear-ed to let this one go. **TRASH 3**

**Pearesto**

I think the name might be a pun, like PRESTO!, only PEAResto! instead, and if that’s true, that’s too cute. Doesn’t have the burpy off-note of FLV Pear. Also doesn’t have quite the same mealy pear body as FLV Burpy Pear, but I did get a deep, natural, juicy pear, with some of that body, and a touch of pear skin. It’s also one of the less crisp, riper pears, so if you’re going for a cooked pear, especially a skin-on cooked pear like you might have with a rustic baked pear tart, this might be exactly what you’re looking for. As with a lot of flavors that taste natural, FLV Pearesto it lacks the punch of a more artificial, candyish pear flavor, but one of those could be added to it in a mix in a small amount if needed to push it forward. Bottom line though, I really like the depth on it, and the natural-type skin on pear flavor. People are going to do some awesome things with this one. It’s very potent and needs to be used carefully. At 2% and 3%, that skin note is a little weird in a unique way. Not quite floral, not quite grassy, not quite nail polish remover, but a light touch of a weird amalgamation of all that. Luckily, at 1.5% and even 1%, there’s plenty of great, authentic pear flavor without any off notes. You probably want to keep FLV Pearesto under 2% for a sub-ohm setup.

I’m curious about this [Messy Vacation](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/235597#messy_vacation_by_diy_discord) recipe that was put together in under an hour, pear, blackberry, citrus, and rum? **TASK 11**

And hoping the weird spice notes from FA Zeppola are buried in this [Pastry with apple and pears](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/294344#apples_and_pears_by_mullas). Not that some spice is out of place with apples and pears, but I hate when Zeppola provides all the spice in a recipe. **TASK 12**

**Peppermint**

It’s a fairly intense, extra-mentholated icy peppermint that leaves my mouth feeling freezing cold. That first inhale of fresh air after vaping this at 1% is getting into brain freeze territory. It’s a candy peppermint and not a peppermint leaf, but it’s much more like popping an Altoid than sucking on a candy cane. Curiously strong! It does have some sweet body under the strong mentholated peppermint hit; it’s not thin, but it’s not heavily sweet, either.

It’s in three or four things I already plan to mix. Adding:

[Peppermint Quickie](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/183247#peppermint_quickie_by_queeryourvape). Just three ingredients. **TASK 13**

And this [White Chocolate Peppermint](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/233303#algie_s_white_chocolate_peppermint_by_queeryourvape) by the same mixer. **TASK 14**

**Persimmon**

Tastes like persimmon, more or less. Bright soft fleshy juicy fruit, sort of like an apricot and a peach and plum gangbanged a tomato, just a little more honeyed sweetness would be even more authentic. This flavor breaks my heart because it smells and tastes AMAZING, but it’s harsh AF to me, like the harshest peach you can imagine and then some, to the point I can’t enjoy it over 0.5%, and there’s not much flavor at 0.5%. Goodbye, FLV Persimmon, I would do very bad things for a non-harsh version of you. **TRASH 4**

**Persimmon Spice**

Dry, more than one spice, ginger forward but also...? Bitter, oddly thick, orange or some other citrus peel. Possibly some cardamom. Not sure about this one. Herbal? A little green. It’s odd.

SPDR used it in [a remix of Coop’s Kiwi Bourbon](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/264215#spdr_s_not_kiwi_bourbon_by_spdrjrslm) and that is something I can’t pass up trying. **TASK 15**

**Pineapple**

A sharp-but-sweet, natural-tasting pineapple with unusual but not unpleasant hints of oranges and underripe banana at 3% but enough flavor, without off notes, at half that. Some natural pineapple tartness in the juicier top notes, but a thick body. Is pineapple juice with extra pulp at thing? This is like extra pulp pineapple juice.That tartness on top does come with a little throat hit, though, and it seems too juicy to turn into a pineapple bakery yet a little under-juicy for drinks.

I need it for Feint, Concrete’s Pina Colada Swisher that I just added to the to-mix list last week. I also need it for [Sandy Pineapple](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/155816#sandy_pineapple_by_goosegirl), an awesome recipe that mixes pineapple with almond, apricot, and cream soda. **TASK 16**

And I need to try [Monkey D. Luffy](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/208604#monkey_d_luffy_by_wolfwheeler), a tropical gummy candy. **TASK 17**

**Pink Fruit**

I don’t know what it is. It’s a very light flavor. It tastes like a very soft, sweet, mixed grape generic berry thing. It tastes like it could very easily be mostly overrun in a mix, but still contribute... something. Sweetness, fullness, IDK.

Pretty forgettable flavor but I’m too interested in this [braaains](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/294407#braaains_by_vapenxx) recipe to toss it just yet. Frosty pink slushy to vape while I’m killing zombies? **TASK 18**

**Pink Guava**

Grapefruit or Guava? One of my favorite flavors of all time, but it tastes more like a grapefruit than a guava… or does it? Some people have said it tastes just like guava to them. I’ve never had fresh guava, is this what fresh guava tastes like? I’ve had lots of guava nectar and some guava jelly and guava candy, but no fresh guava. It tastes specifically (mostly) like a Rio Star ruby red grapefruit from South Texas to me, but not at all like a white or even an ordinary pink grapefruit. Maybe those red grapefruits taste more like guava than other grapefruits? Or there are different kinds of guava and FLV Pink Guava tastes like one of them but not others? There’s a good bit of tartness and just a little bitterness in the top, just enough bitterness to make it mouthwatering and give it a juicy feel. It does have a real deep and a little funky tropical fruit syrupy sweetness to it, but when they’re fully ripe, so do those ruby red grapefruits. I think it’s that bit of wonderful funk that caused Cheeba to once say “it tastes like good pussy.” I can’t disagree. Thicc for such a citrusy flavor. Some citrus-type throat hit, but easily smoothed out with other flavors.

Oh, god. What _don’t_ I need it for or want to try with it?

Needed for many favorites already on the list, plus some that haven’t been added yet or haven’t been added recently, such as:

[Fiestas & Fiascos](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/14486#fiestas_and_fiascos_by_concreteriver). This is probably sacrilegious but I keep saying OoO Vanilla Custard Cheesecake is what LA Cream Cheese Icing should have tasted like. I want to see what happens if I sub it in here. **TASK 19**

[Pank Milk](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/184392#pank_milk_by_id10_t). It’s mine, and I love it, even if it is really just a Walmart brand Fiestas & Fiascos. **TASK 20**

[Grapefruit Rose Paloma](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/148248#grapefruit_rose_paloma_by_tamvapes). It’s what it says it is. **TASK 21**

Needed for many things already listed to try, here’s more:

[Guava Soda](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/201375#guava_soda_by_johnny2vapes). Guava with VT Creaming Soda. I want that. **TASK 22**

[Red Mango](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/252258#red_mango_developed100_by_capiadiy). Yes! **TASK 23**

[Tropicana Cabana](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/151436#tropicana_cabana_developed_by_developed). Fetch me my drink umbrella! **TASK 24**

[GuaVanilla Custard](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/291986#guavanilla_custard_by_facemeat). Apparently a “happy accident” recipe. **TASK 25**

**Pistachio**

FLV Pistachio 2% - Unlike other pistachio flavors, this is not at all sweet, which helps with the authenticity. It’s got a solidly realistic roasted nut up front that really tastes like a pistachio, or at least closer to a pistachio than any other nut. It’s so accurate to a dry roasted nut you can almost taste the salt on it. With the dryness it has, it kinda feels salty. The salt isn’t really there in the flavor, but my brain wants to fill in that blank. The roasted part dies off over the course of the exhale and is replaced by something thick and almost creamy, but more like having a mouthful of thoroughly chewed up nuts is a kind of creamy than like you dipped your roasted nuts into some kind of cream. As far as off-notes go, every so often, I can pick up the slightest hint of cherry in this one at 2% and above, but it’s extremely faint as well as intermittent, and 2% is too high.

FLV Pistachio is used in a couple of things I’m already planning try. I’ll add my own [1-2-3 Pistachio Lime](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/87984#1_2_3_pistachio_lime_by_id10_t) **TASK 26** but this time, really thinking about how to take it to another level.

Might already have an idea, will go ahead and give this a mix while I’ve got the Pistachio out.

Pistachio Slime V1 **TASK 27**

| Co. | Flavor                | %    |
| --- | --------------------- | ---- |
| TFA | Pistachio             | 3    |
| VT  | Persian Lime          | 2    |
| FLV | Pistachio             | 1    |
| FLV | Lime                  | 0.25 |
| WF  | Frozen Yogurt         | 2    |
| CAP | Vanilla Whipped Cream | 2    |

**Popcorn**

It does popcorn really well, so well that you can almost taste the salt, similar to FLV Pistachio. Like it’s not really there, but my brain badly wants to fill in that blank because not having it is confusing. It’s not perfect, but it’s a clearer, more accurate popcorn flavor than others overall. It’s dry - which might be an accuracy plus - but dry enough to be a little rough. It seems like it can’t decide whether it wants to be a kettle or a caramel popcorn: There’s a sweet glaze on it that tastes too caramelized for the sugar on kettle corn but stops well short of full caramel. It’s kind of top heavy on the actual popcorn flavor, but full-textured around that sweet glaze. Also, worth noting I’m pretty sure there’s some butyric acid in there. But I’m pretty sensitive to the stuff and it’s not enough to bother me, so there’s a good chance it won’t bother you, either, depending on what it’s mixed with, how much is used, and how long it steeped.

It’s in some things I loved in the past but can no longer enjoy because certain flavors taste like pepper to me now, and in a few things I’ve already added to the to-do. One of these could also be a new favorite:

[Waffle Crisp](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/184298#waffle_crisp_by_silky). I forgot Waffle Crisp cereal existed! Now I can vape it (hopefully). **TASK 28**

The rest of these are all tobacco recipes.

[3-2-1 Caramel Popcorn Tobacco](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/310457#3_2_1_caramel_popcorn_tobacco_by_krawacabana). Looks like it needs some more tobacco to have tobacco in the name since Vanilla For Pipe hardly has any, but I want to give it a try. **TASK 29**

[Full Count](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/225429#full_count_by_wolfwheeler) Cracker Jack RY4. **TASK 30**

[Simple #1](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/275184#simple_1_by_sebastien) Another popcorn RY4. **TASK 31**

[Dead Black Asteroid](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/234026#dead_black_asteroid_by_nivsh). Just an RY4 that happens to have FLV Popcorn in it. **TASK 32**

[Pop My RY4 Double](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/209896#pop_my_ry4_double_by_joe_roots). Another RY4 with popcorn in it. **TASK 33**

[Fairground Butterscotch Custard Tobacco](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/206736#fairground_butterscotch_custard_tobacco_developedflv_by_dixxleroo). **TASK 34**

**Pound Cake**

Coconut pound cake, maybe? But as a pound cake flavor? It’s pretty fucked up. It’s very coconutty, I would say it’s even more of a coconut than a pound cake or any other kind of bakery flavor. The coconut is prominent and similar to FLV Coconut, where it’s a very buttery coconut, but this is significantly sweeter than FLV Coconut, it’s extremely sweet. It’s very smooth and very thick but doesn’t really have any bakery texture. It has some bright vanilla in there as well. I’m aware that some people get a bit of anise from this one, but it doesn’t taste like anise to me, it’s just something weird and difficult to place, which combined with all that coconuttiness reminds me of taro, like a coconut-potato hybrid.

After my experience this week with the lemon pound cake, I have trust issues with this flavor. As in, I’m having trouble trusting that the off-notes are going to be covered up in a mix. Looked at a bunch of recipes and all I would think was that they were going to taste of coconut and that weird anise-potato off-note in addition to all the things they were supposed to taste like and it got me to the point of fuckit. I’ve got a lot of flavors to get rid of. FLV Pound Cake can be one of them. **TRASH 5**

**Pralines**

**TRASH 6** Gnarly! Same weird mushroom taste as in FLV Crunch Cereal, just not as much as in Crunch Cereal. It’s sweet but has a creamy rather than sugary feel to it, brown caramely creamy sweetness, and a little nutty, like caramel sauce with nuts and bits of shrooms.

**Pucker**

It tastes kind of tart with a weird smokey tobacco note in it. I’m still not personally sure how it works but it worked in [IPA Smoke](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/98302#ipa_smoke_by_matthewkocanda). I’m already going to try [American Slang](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/66864#american_slang_by_chemicalburnvictim). Might as well add one more, [Pucker up, Moya Cheri](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/247548#pucker_up_moya_cheri_by_nowar). **TASK 35**

**Pumpkin Bread**

Previously tried it at 2 and 3% and thought it was almost like they got pumpkin bread and pumpernickel bread a little confused, and maybe even a little rye bread in there. I make pumpkin bread and this is not MY pumpkin bread, though it might be someone’s pumpkin bread. My pumpkin bread is more like cake, very sweet. Like really good banana bread, but with pumpkin instead of banana. I’m aware that Pumpkin Bread can be made much breadier and healthier, or more savory and less dessert, but this is not that. This is more like a full, thick, dark, yeasty bread, with something a little rye-like. There’s some sweetness, but not much, and light nutmeg-forward pumpkin spice flavors and maybe a little actual pumpkin on the back end. It would need to be much sweeter, more moist, and less dark, but I could see it being used to make pumpkin bread, maybe, with a lot of work. And there might be other fun uses for it. I also got some slight puky butyric-ish type off-note at 3%, that I didn’t get at all at 2% after steeping for a week, though that yeasty business did come across a little fermented. I made myself a note to try this again at 0.5% and haven’t done it yet, but there isn’t anything I really want to mix with it, so **TRASH 6**

**Pumpkin Spice**

Very rare to find any flavor that is actually perfect but as best I can tell FLV Pumpkin Spice is the perfect pumpkin spice flavor. It has a nice balance of all four parts of a pumpkin spice blend, and if I focus I can pick them out, but if I don’t it just tastes like “pumpkin spice.” Rich and deep flavor. A bit dry and harsh at 1%, but not out of line for a spice flavor. Plenty of flavor and less harsh at 0.75%. It really should not come as a surprise that this is so good because FLV does all the individual spices in pumpkin spice so well (see Eggnog for the nutmeg), but there are so many ways this could go wrong or at least be unbalanced and FLV Pumpkin Spice is just.. Perfect.

I need it for some favorites such as [Gourd is Dead](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/236620#gourd_is_dead_by_wolfwheeler) that have already been listed, and new ones I already plan to try, such as [The Fall Waits For No One](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/117190#the_fall_waits_for_no_one_fried_sweet_pumpkin_donuts_by_mech_mod_rn). Not stopping there.

I deeply enjoyed [Carrot Cake RY4 Deluxe Version](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/220109#carrot_cake_ry4_deluxe_version_by_lonesomerhodestn) but that is just so many flavors go dig out. I’ll try the shorter, [non-deluxe version](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/219753) now. **TASK 36**

[Sorteal’s Holiday Custard](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/297368#sorteal_s_holiday_custard_by_sorteal). Really interested in that custard base of CAP Vanilla Custard, TFA Vanilla Custard 2, and WF French Vanilla (Thick), not to mention the caramel, pumpkin spice, and white chocolate toppings. **TASK 37**

[Santa’s Eggnog](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/239779#santa_s_eggnog_by_steam84). Merry Christmas! White chocolate eggnog with rum. **TASK 38**

New Flavor Count: 2,558
