TASK OR TRASH - Each flavor gets assigned at least one task or it goes in the trash.

## CAPELLA

**Frosting**

Update. I tried to make a cookie with heavy frosting (Like those Lofthouse cookies you can buy at the grocery store) out of CAP Frosting to see if it was worth hanging on to. As a single flavor, it really appealed to my inner child. But after tasting the recipe, I realized that while it did capture that mass-produced sugar bomb frosting that kids love pretty well, the recipe would have simply tasted better to me if I’d just used WF or VT buttercream frostings, or OoO Vanilla Frosting, or FLV frosting. Or even OoO Vanilla Custard Cheesecake, which makes a damn good cream cheese icing. I guess this is growing up. **TRASH 1**

I had hoped to push out multiple updates this week (8 recipes are mixed and steeped and just waiting for me to try them). But, another little temporary side project (more on that at a later date, perhaps) has kept my wicks wet all week.

## FLAVOUR ART

**Bavarian Cream**

The least custardy Bavarian Cream. Thinner than the other Bavarian Creams, but not really thin. It’s thicker than whipped cream but not a lot thicker, and there’s some dairy to it but it’s not sour. A sweet dairy cream flavor with some kinda spicy, or vanilla beany vanilla. Touch of brown sugar lurking in the background. Maybe a little dry? Or at least, not buttery. Tastes like it doesn’t have any DAAP but it doesn’t taste butyric at all either. No eggyness or rich custardness. Think FA Cream Fresh plus vanilla. If Bavarian cream is supposed to be like vanilla custard and whipped cream had a baby, this is more like vanilla whipped cream had custard as a step-parent.

I could take it or leave it, depending on finding or not finding a recipe that uses it and looks irresistible. I’ve already got a couple of those in line for mixing. I didn’t see a third one but I do have an idea for something it might be good in, going back to that [1-2-3 Butter Pecan Pie](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/132750#1_2_3_butter_pecan_pie_by_id10_t), that came up last week, I want to see how FA Bavarian fares as a homemade whipped cream-type topping for that, so I’ll mix it again and add 2% FA Bavarian Cream **TASK 1**

**Beer**

It kinda tastes like flat Bud Light after it has been sitting out overnight, but a little sweeter, more yeasty, and even less hoppy than that. I don’t hate it, you could definitely build a beer vape out of it, but I’ll also be perfectly happy to never taste that again. **TRASH 2**

**Bell Pepper**

This flavor 100% tastes like bell pepper. It’s also ridiculously potent - I think a few drops would be enough to make an Olympic sized swimming pool taste like bell pepper. And it lingers, terribly. All over the room for days, and I thought I might have to throw away an RDA (but was eventually able to get the aroma out after multiple tries). I don’t know why I haven’t already disposed of this, other than flavor hoarding is a real sickness. **TRASH 3**

**Bergamot**

Very strong. Bittersweet, fragrant, floral, green, a little spicy, orange rindy. Tastes very accurately like the difference between Earl Grey and plain tea. No tea notes, just the difference between the two. This is dry and because of that it is not a lot of fun to vape as a single flavor, but I can see a little of it doing a lot of work in all kinds of recipes. And it does, everything from spiced teas to cereals to pastries where it’s used to rind up other oranges. Probably worth noting that it tastes so much like VT Bergamot that I don’t think any really needs to have both, except that this FA Bergamot is about four times more potent than the VT version. FA Bergamot is also used in many times more recipes than VT’s.

I already have [Shameless](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/12733#shameless_another_fruit_cereal_by_jbird) and [A Real Orange Juice](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/157915#a_real_orange_juice_finally_by_motherpunker) on my to-try list.

I’m really interested in an aspect of this [Nightsicle](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/200954#nightsicle_by_rug_ly) recipe - using Bergamot to enhance a lime, but I can’t do TFA VBIC or even the LB VIC suggested as a sub, so I’m going to mix it with my [1-2-3 VIC](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/215957#1_2_3_vic_by_id10_t) as a substitute for the 3% TFA VBIC. **TASK 2**

**Bilberry**

FA Bilberry is often used to add a level of natural-ness or fullness to more artificial blueberries and make them more well-rounded and realistic. It is a thick, full-bodied natural blueberry. FA Bilberry gets pretty gnarly over 1% or so with this sweaty sock off-note thing it has going on. On the other hand, it can be made to work higher. See [Blue Eyes White Dragon](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/124392#blue_eyes_white_dragon_by_foment_life). Terrific recipe, has FA Bilberry at a whopping 2.7% and doesn’t taste at all like socks to me, I think there’s some magic going on there with the peaches and INW Dragon Fruit. **TASK 3**

I need FA Bilberry for the aforementioned, but most of the time I think a similar flavor - Jungle Flavors Blueberry - would be an improvement over FA Bilberry (at about twice the concentration).

It gets used in several recipes I’m already planning to mix. Even though [Black N Blue Suckle](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/9437#black_n_blue_suckle_by_philosaphucker) is more than six years old, it looks terrific to me and I can’t wait to try it. **TASK 4**

Reviews sold [Holy Trinity Ice Cream](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/115624#holy_trinity_ice_cream_by_alfredpudding) to me. **TASK 5** But I’ll also use it to test my JF Blueberry hypothesis by mixing another bottle using 1% JF Blueberry in place of the 0.5% bilberry and seeing if it’s an improvement - or if I can even tell the difference. **TASK 6**

**Bitter Wizard**

I haven’t tried it over 1% so maybe it does if you push it, but as best I can tell, it does not actually taste bitter when vaped. It really doesn’t taste like anything, just a very slight chemical taste that’s hard to describe and easy to cover up, but it does seem to neutralize some of the inherent sweetness of VG. For example, you have an 80% VG mix, that’s got some sweetness to it. Add 0.5% Bitter Wizard, it’s just as thick as an 80/20 mix, but it tastes more like a 50/50 mix. That’s why, when I made a plan to mix a plain martini back in part 38, I included 0.5% Bitter Wizard, because a martini should not be as sweet as even the 60/40 I’ve been mixing lately.

Seems like it could be very useful in tobaccos. And a must if you are crazy enough to try mixing weird savory vapes like meat, cheese, pizza, pickle, whatever.

I screwed up twice but the second screw up canceled out the first. First, I planned to throw away FLV Pear, even though I wanted to try [Real Orange Juice](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/157915#a_real_orange_juice_finally_by_motherpunker), a recipe that uses both FLV Pear and Bitter Wizard. Oops. But then when I went black out that week’s trash on my flavor spreadsheet (and write down the location so I could then pull it and physically trash it), I missed it. Double oops. So FLV Pear is still there. And Real Orange Juice is back on the table! I’m pretty sure I didn’t forget to subtract it from the count, which is a step in by process before blacking out flavors and writing down their locations, so I’ve changed my current flavor count +1 to reflect FLV Pear’s somehow surviving my attempt to kill it. Anyway, I have a couple of things to do with Bitter Wizard already (Martini of my own creation and Real Orange Juice). To add one more, [Devils Custard](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/88277#devils_custard_by_chrisdvr1) just to see if I can figure out why ChrisDVR once put Bitter Wizard into a custard. WHY?! He says it “creates contrast.” **TASK 7**

**Black Cherry**

Tastes like black cherry soda syrup with some cough medicine and a little hint of that awful new vinyl shower curtain off-note. Sweet, but not as sweet as the very-similar-tasting FW Black Cherry. Certainly not the worst cherry flavor out there, but not good enough for me to even bother looking at recipes that use it. **TRASH 4**

**Black Fire**

It just tastes like smoke. That’s it. Not cigarette smoke, like the smoke flavor that comes off of smoked meats. For that reason, it makes a pretty fun additive to tobaccos, but you can use it in other places, too, like Concrete’s Unpopular Opinions recipe, where he used it to help make a grilled peach flavor.

Speaking of Concrete, I need it for [Feint](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/38680#feint_by_concreteriver). **TASK 8**

It’s also in a few things I’m going to try: Old Man Cobb, Early Autumn Pipe, and Cherry Oak Tobacco. Two more:

[Maybe I’ll Catch Fire](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/54211#maybe_i_ll_catch_fire_by_chemicalburnvictim). Could be my next drinking buddy. **TASK 9**

[Con un par](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/157027#con_un_par_smooth_real_tobacco_by_jayway). That looks like a solid, straightforward smokey tobacco mix. **TASK 10**

**Black Pepper**

Kept low it just tastes like cracked black pepper. Over 1% it starts to get a little floral. It’s top heavy and thin, which is something you probably what you want in a pepper flavor. It’s just a little starting note like adding pepper on top of something, doesn’t taste like much beyond that. With all the complaints about peppery nic you might think, why on earth would you add pepper to your vape, but it’s not peppery nic flavor. “Peppery” is just by far the most relatable way of describing bad nic and Vanilla Bean Ice Cream off-notes, but bad nic isn’t exactly legit black pepper like this. I see it mostly used with tobacco but IMO it’s being underused. It can actually make your basier fruits taste sweeter by contrast. Strawberries, peaches, chocolate. Look online you can find food recipes for strawberry shortcake with black pepper, chocolate cake and brownies with black pepper, Martha Stewart’s Black Pepper Cheesecake, South African Chocolate Pepper Cookies, and black pepper ice cream.

I’m going to try [Irish Oak](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/88759#irish_oak_by_chemicalburnvictim) because I have all the ingredients for it and CBV used the notes to expose his process. **TASK 11**

**Black Tea**

Strong, very astringent, like hot black tea that’s a little over-steeped. Also a bit dry and a tiny bit dirty, not very refreshing, but gets the job done. Pushing it too high becomes more like a mouthful of unwashed dry tea leaves than tea; don’t recommend going over around 1.5% for most setups.

I can’t think of anything that uses this that I want to mix again and can’t find anything that uses it that I want to try. **TRASH 5**

**Black Touch**

Very molasses-y, warm, spicy licorice. Licorice is usually made with molasses but the ratio here is odd. More of a licorice-flavored molasses than just a licorice made with molasses. Even has that slight bitter edge of blackstrap molasses. Not the thickest, most full-bodied of flavors, but not what I’d call thin either.

Already planning to mix Black Drums of War, Licorice Berry Much, Shoggoth, Blackstrap, and Black Soda - all recipes that use both CAP Licorice and FA Black Touch.

I also need it for one of my favorite recipes, [Black Custard](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/158168#black_custard_by_staybert). Licorice custard? WTF. I couldn’t resist trying this weird little 1-2-3 recipe. I really don’t get licorice from it. It’s a very sweet custard (man, that FA Marshmallow really goes well with that FA Custard Premium, should see those paired more often). The Black Touch just kind of melts into it and leaves it a dark, mysterious spice note and molasses sweetness. I love it. I also think this is a perfect recipe for people who don’t know why they own FA Black Touch because they don’t even like licorice. **TASK 12**

**Blackberry**

Super **TRASH 6**! Completely unvapeable. I think Concrete’s video that shows him burning a bottle of it with a torch should be required viewing for anyone thinking about buying this, holy shit it’s bad. It tastes like perfume like grandma would wear, also harsh and just nasty. More of a chemical weapon than a flavor.

**Blackcurrant**

It tastes like dark sweet grape, mostly, mixed with some bright tart raspberry-ish flavor on top, and a bit of funky ripeness to it . Maybe slightly on the dry side of things, but nothing that seems like a terrible off note to me, and not thin, has a good volume of syrupy candy body. Seems too syrupy to be super accurate, more of a really interesting candy flavor, like a partially chewed gummy candy. Can come across “jammy” in a mix. I see it used in a lot of different fruit mixes to add tarter top notes and darker sweet depth and that seems about right. Mix with blueberries, blackberries, raspberries, all kinds of stuff. Backup cherries with it, maybe. Probably the most useful blackcurrant flavor, if not the most delicious or interesting.

It’s a couple of my of my new favorite recipes: [French Mornings](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/145323#french_mornings_by_kittybit) and [Deez Dragon Nuts](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/261981#deez_dragon_nuts_by_mixnjuice) It’s also in at least a dozen things I already plan to try, including one that’s already mixed and just waiting for me to get around to trying it.

But wait there’s more.

[Blue Indigo Grape](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/280622#blue_indigo_grape_by_tugnil). **TASK 13** Grape, Blackcurrant, Blueberry, Cold.

[Razzler](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/48868#razzler_by_ediblemalfunction). Lemon-Lime, Raspberry, and Blackcurrant **TASK 14**

[Pink Vanilla Cream](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/309516#pink_vanilla_cream_by_technokasper). I’m digging the way both the creams combo (TFA Bavarian, INW Custard, OoO Marshmallow Vanilla, TFA Vanilla Swirl) and the fruit combo (blackcurrant, raspberry, and strawberry) look individually, looking forward to finding out how they work together. **TASK 15**

[Raspberry Meringue PIe](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/297674#raspberry_meringue_pie_by_kuri_santou). It’s the WF Flapper Pie for me. **TASK 16**

**Blood Orange**

Seems like a solid option for a tasty natural not candy but plenty sweet blood orange type citrus, but I feel like I’m getting something between a blood orange and a tangerine that actually leans a little closer to tangerine than blood orange, though there is a hint of red sort of lurking in there. Mild hint of zest on top and lingering, medium body/base that can pass for fruit flesh, not really juicy, maybe juicy for FA in general but not juicy juicy. Throat hit mild for a citrus, so moderate overall.

I need it for [All Day](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/78350#all_day_by_maxsavage), Deez Dragon Nuts, and [1-2-3 Coco Sang](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/137033#1_2_3_coco_sang_by_nikosd). **TASK 17** for mixing Coco Sang, haven’t had that in a long time.

Also 1 or 2 other things I’ve planned to try, and this [Valencia Cupcake](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/265295#valencia_cupcake_orange_frosted_cake_by_goombavapez), an orange-frosted cake. **TASK 18**

**Blueberry Juicy Ripe**

Nice blueberry. Has some brighter tartness to the front end but also a nice ripe depth. They may well have put their own Bilberry out of business with this one because that mostly gets used to add some ripeness and realism to other blueberries and this one doesn’t seem to need it or to be as tricky to use as Bilberry. Probably not too bright and tart to be morphed into a cooked blueberry in a mix but tastes more like a fresh one on its own. Doesn’t quite live up to the “juicy” part of the name, though, but it’s not terribly dry either. It’s a little soft, too, and seems like it could still benefit from another blueberry layer. It doesn’t need to be any sweeter though, it’s very sweet, almost too sweet for a natural blueberry flavor but probably not for most mixes that you’d use blueberry for except maybe tobacco.

I need it for trying the aforementioned (under Blackcurrant) Blue Indigo Grape recipe and a couple of others.

Also, [Toshiro](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/200452#toshiro_by_wolfwheeler) **TASK 19** and a similar recipe, [Shoot The Blue Moon](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/205413#shoot_the_blue_moon_by_rogueislander). **TASK 20**

And this [1-2-3 Peach Berries](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/206984#123_peach_berries_by_lediybr) because I have a soft spot for these simple fruit mixes. **TASK 21**

**Brandy**

Not really brandy. Not boozy at all. It’s really oddly creamy and tastes like a warm, fruity sweet cream. The fruitiness is a little like sweet white wine but also a little like a watered down unspiced nonalcoholic apple cider.

My bottle of FA Brandy is just about empty from mixing a whole bunch of [Stag Night](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/14834#stag_night_by_wh1skeyk1ng), but it’s been awhile so I’ll order some more and mix some more. **TASK 22** Also want to try this [Million Bucks](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/130829#a_million_bucks_a_stag_night_remix_by_catwillmew) Stag Night remix that looks even better than the original. **TASK 23**

**Bread Crust**

It tastes like puppies. No bread, just puppies. Not dogs, distinctly puppies. Like, if I blindfolded you and had you sniff a dog and a puppy, you could easily tell me which one is which. This is puppy flavor. I love puppies, but they’re outright gross to vape. This concentrate is also ridiculously potent, 0.25% is overwhelming puppy flavor, vaping it stank up my room. **TRASH 7**

**Breakfast Cereals**

I’m aware that not everyone agrees, and maybe I’m broken, but I get mostly coconut cereal. It’s not gross to me, but it is very strange. Dry toasted honey oat cereal with a bunch of coconut flakes, or in coconut milk, maybe. It’s not unpleasant at all but not something I generally look for in a cereal. However, I think if you’re mixing a cereal with milk, that coconut might disappear into the milk or cream flavor. There might be a bit of corn flake in there as well but I get more oat and coconut than corn or wheat flakes. There’s a bit of malt and some sweetness that tastes kinda like honey, more like baked-in honey rather than an added-on honey. FA Description is very weird. Flavourart calls this "the flavour of chocolate milk combined with red fruits and hazelnuts." I am getting literally none of that at 2% or 3%. I had to push it to 5% to get anything like chocolate or nuts out of it at all, at that point it starts to taste like a little bit of Nutella mixed with toasted coconut honey oat cereal. The “red fruits” thing never made any kind of appearance at all.

I’m tempted by [Lemon Cake with Coconut Butter Cream](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/127968#lemon_cake_with_coconut_butter_cream_diydownundernovemberchallenge_by_joe_roots) and by [Euler - Chocolate Coconut Pie](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/86249#euler_chocolate_coconut_pie_by_mophead) but also feeling like I’ve been doing such a poor job of getting rid of flavors, I need to push my FOMO down deep and let this one go. **TRASH 8**

**Burley**

Otherwise an ok earthy, somewhat woody, light brown tobacco, but it has this slight green bell pepper off-note that’s really distracting, and lingers in the finish. Me no likely. **TRASH 9**

**Butter**

Tastes very slightly movie theater fake popcorn butter-ish, but mostly just tastes like butter. Thick, rich butter. Very thick, and very rich. Quite bottom-heavy. Smooth to the point of almost being greasy, like butter. Very satisfying.

I prefer VT Butter Base because sometimes with FA that fake movie popcorn butter flavor comes across in a mix and is distracting to the point of ruining it, but I think it’s a solid butter option more often than not.

It’s in a couple of recipes I already have listed, and I want to add [Time Machine Cookie](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/247709#time_machine_cookie_by_davidn2kl) I’ll sub JF Cookie for FA Cookie because I already chucked FA Cookie. **TASK 24**

**Butterscotch**

Not a super accurate butterscotch, but a tasty and useful ingredient for a caramelly brown sugar butterscotch-ish sticky sweetness.

I don’t have any favorite recipes that use it, but I probably will after I try a bunch of things already listed, plus:

[Butterscotch Rippled](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/256824#butterscotch_rippled_by_cam9535). I can’t imagine that not being delicious butterscotch ice cream. **TASK 25**

[Drops of Jupiter](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/142250#drops_of_jupiter_by_diydownunderpippa) is a butterscotch pudding pie that caught my eye because of the combination of WF Buttercream Frosting, WF Flapper Pie, and VT Honeycomb. **TASK 26**

[Even Nick Can Make Custard 2](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/273953#even_nick_can_make_custard_v2_by_renickuluss) Really interested in how that croissant and banana work in there. **TASK 27**

[Idiot Proof](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/234334#idiot_proof_3_2_1_by_sensory_overload), a 1-2-3 butterscotch custard that looks simply delicious. **TASK 28**

**Jammy/Candy Wizard**

Has a clear jammy sweetness and seems like it might actually work to turn fruits jammy. Very concentrated additive, perfumy at 1%, recommend 0.5% or so only.. Tastes like it has a bunch of maltol in it but isn’t just that. Also has a tart, indistinct, passionfruit juice-like, citrusy aspect with a little juicy, mouthwatering quality. Not sure if it also tastes a little strawberry-like or if I’ve just come to associate that maltol taste with strawberry flavors.

Couple of things I want to try that use it: [Laces Out](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/246751#laces_out_by_sensory_overload) strawberry red laces, to see if it tops [LIc Her..Ish](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/69073#lic_her_ish_by_digitaldrops) as my favorite red licorice recipe. **TASK 29**

And [Berry Gummies](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/221257#berry_gummies_by_88arden88) because WF Wild Berry Gummy Candy is yummy. I’ll sub CAP Super Sweet for the PUR Super Sweet I don’t have; usually I would go with FW Sweetener, but it’s candy. **TASK 30**

**Cantaloupe**

Super authentic under ripe cantaloupe - kind of rindy - stacked on top of a sweet, thick melon ring candy. Overall effect of this is not exactly unpleasant, but is kinda weird. It tastes like if that under ripe flavor can be covered up, the base would go really well in lots of melony places, especially candy.

[Mango Melon Chew](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/97864#mango_melon_chew_mixin_vixens_juicefairy_mix_by_juicefairy) is a great recipe that uses it at 1% and just barely misses the mark for me to count it as something I just have to mix again. I’m already planning to try [Stuck on an Island](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/229837#stuck_on_an_island_by_yourmainmatt) that uses it at 0.5%, but mostly mixing that for the interesting Wild Melon/Coconut pairing. Speaking of Wild Melon, I’ll give this [Melon Mania II](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/242358#melon_mania_ii_by_cam9535) recipe a try as well. It’s got a very nice-looking combination of ingredients there along with with the Wild Melon and a little bit of FA Melon Cantaloupe -- FA Indian Mango, TFA Papaya, INW Prickly Pear. **TASK 31**

**Cappuccino**

It’s mostly cream, with very little coffee, but I don’t want more of that coffee, because it tastes burnt and slightly skunky. It’s also harsh on top, not smooth and soothing like a cream should be, with a sweeter finish that tastes like half scalded milk and half coconut milk. No es bueno. **TRASH 10**

New Flavor Count: 2,487
