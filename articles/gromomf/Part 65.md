# CAPELLA

**Juicy Peach**

Update. Looking for more uses for CAP Juicy Peach, I tried [Kiss My Peach](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/110929-kiss_my_peach/reviews), and found a keeper! On one hand, it's kind of a boring profile. It's just peach. Nothing else. Peach. Yawn. Also, it's a little rough on the throat for me. No more than the average peach flavor, but definitely something for people who are very sensitive to peach flavors to be aware of. On the other hand, it's absolutely delicious. Perfectly peachy. Super juicy, with just enough cactus to make it so without the cactus taste coming out. And sticky sweet, with just enough sweetener to make it so without it tasting like dumping a Splenda packet on a peach. When I want to have a vape that's just plain peach, I'll definitely come back to this one. **TASK 1**

**Juicy Lemon**

Update. I mixed one recipe looking for something to do with CAP Juicy Lemon and found another winner, [Lemon Apricot Cereal](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/259826-lemon_apricot_cereal_repost_adv). Terrific! Darkly sweetened (think brown sugar and honey) multigrain cereal with bits of apricot and a hint of lemon. Unique and delicious. It does seem like the 0.75% CAP Super Sweet in there is just a touch much for such an otherwise healthy-tasting thing though. It's got a bit of a Splenda-packet finish. When I mix this again, I'll try dropping that down to 0.5%. **TASK 2**

**Lemon Lime**

Update. Tried a handful of recipes looking for more uses for CAP Lemon Lime, and most were in the “good but not great” or “great but not gotta mix again great” range. But one stood out: [Rainforest - Soda Remix](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/157923-rainforest_soda_remix/reviews). Awesome and a new favorite for me, but do not mix if you don't like the combination of CAP Sweet Guava and INW Cactus. It clearly tastes of both, but also more. And the citrusy and sweet floral accouterments uplift it beautifully. I want to add a little sweetener to it but want to be careful not to mess it up, so I'll try the addition of just 0.25% FW Sweetener when I make it again. **TASK 3**

# LORANN'S FLAVORS

**Grape**

I don't know what I'm even doing with this, maybe ordered by mistake? Don't want to vape food coloring. **TRASH 1**

**Grape (Colorless)**

An extremely “meh” purple flavor. It's blatantly artificial but I wouldn't call it candy because it's not sweet and it's not as punchy as candy. It's flat and a little dull. Sounds terrible, but I've used it in a recipe because I thought it was a perfect fit for a grape cigarillo flavor - artificial but not assertive. That might be about the only use for it, though. I'll mix another batch of [Grape Escape](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/78817-grape_escape) and think about either improving it or tossing LA Grape. **TASK 4**

**Horchata**

Cinnamon, pennies, flowers, and cream. Subtle but strange cinnamon - a bit coppery and a bit floral at the same time, with a soft vanilla cream. I think that the floral edge to the cinnamon is supposed to be rice, but it's battling with the cinnamon up top and coming across a touch of weird flowery perfume instead. It's mostly soft, kind of fluffy vanilla cream with a dry, bland finish. Some Lorann's flavors vape very nicely, but this one is a good reminder that they definitely weren't designed for that. **TRASH 2**

**Irish Cream**

This is not really safe to vape because it's not water soluble. But people will ingest things that probably aren't super safe if they taste really good (see also: FW Yellow Cake).So I attempted to vape it anyway, just in case it was amazing. It tastes terrible, like shoving a handful of half ground almonds and half sawdust into my mouth and washing it down with old fryer grease. I am probably going to die now. **TRASH 3**

**Lemonade**

People say this is Country Time lemonade but I get watered down Lemonheads candy. It tastes like Lemonheads, but without that intensity of flavor. Like someone tried to make lemonade by dissolving some crushed Lemonheads candy in water. It's also a bit harsh on my throat in a way that's not commensurate with the amount of flavor. I can't really take it up over 6% without harshness and there's not a mouthful of lemonade here at 6%. Now, all of that being said, I know from experience some great recipes including great lemonade recipes can be made out of this, but you have to add additional lemon and, at least for me, something smooth to sand down that sharp throat. I'm team FW Lemonade (Natural) if it comes down to that one or LA Lemonade.

That said, I don't have to pick one or the other and I already have planned to mix a handful of recipes that use LA Lemonade. Here's a couple more:
[Homestar's Melonade](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/194960-homestars_melonade/). FLV Wild Melon goes great with lemon! **TASK 5**

[Le Mangade](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/le_mangade_mango_lemonade). Irresistible-looking mango lemonade. **TASK 6**

**Mango**

Horrible. Tastes like a rotten peach. **TRASH 4**

**Marshmallow**

Mostly tastes like a marshmallow, but has a touch of a weird chemically off-note that's like in the middle of a spectrum that has licorice on one end and mothballs on the other. Very sugary sweet, fairly thick, and smooth. Some brighter vanilla. But I don't want anything to do with either licorice-y moth balls, even a little, so this flavor can fuck right off. **TRASH 5**

**Melon**

I was told this was good and to get it so I did, but still haven't gotten around to opening the bottle. Will do 3% and 6% samples. **TASK 7**

**Natural Blueberry**

Another one still unopened. 3% and 6% samples. **TASK 8**

**Natural Chocolate**

DON'T VAPE THIS IT HAS SUGAR IN IT. Which is a shame because it tastes pretty close to milk chocolate, only slightly off and a little soft. I only tried about 2 ml of it, and that was enough to make my cotton ugly. I didn't vape enough for it to ruin my coils but I'm sure it would have soon enough, and probably given me cancer in the process. **TRASH 6**

**Peach**

It somehow tastes like peach candy without tasting like peach rings; it's a different kind of peach candy. Very sweet and tastes artificial but still clearly a peach, like the peach part of a peach soda or maybe peach koolaid flavoring. Pretty one- or maybe two dimensional, not full of nuances and little notes and things to pick out. You've got your artificial peach flavor, and you've got some soft peachy sweetness, and that's about it. I wouldn't call it thin and it's not dry, but it's not especially thick or juicy either. Probably great for a peach soda or peach tea. Mild harshness at 3%. Even though this is not a bad flavor, there's nothing I want to make that uses it and I have plenty of other peach flavors to play with. **TRASH 7**

**Peanut Butter**

It's not gross! I did not get any of the unfortunate off-notes lots of other other PBs have, but it's not great either. It lacks that stick-to-the-roof-your-mouf-ness. It's thinner and kind of syrupy. Combined with it being a little sweet with cotton candy/spun sugar kind of sweetness, it kinda tastes and feels like some kind of artificially PB-flavored syrup that one might add to a PB milkshake at a fast food restaurant, or something like that. Peanut flavored Italian soda syrup which probably doesn't and definitely shouldn't exist. You get the basic flavor of peanut butter but it doesn't taste like any actual peanuts were involved in making it.

I'll give this [Peanut Butter Pie](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/96017-peanut_butter_pie) a try. I don't know about the LA PB and VT Cheesecake combo but CAP Sugar Cookie, FLV Vanilla Custard, and WF Honey Roasted Peanuts look great together. **TASK 9**

**Pear**

Better candy pear than TFA Pear Candy, I guess. It's really one-noted, a flat, fake but identifiable pear. Not nearly sweet enough to be a candy, but lacks realism to be anything but a candy flavor. It tastes as greenish yellow as a thing can taste without being lemon lime. Nothing I'd call an off note, but it's just very meh. And there's nothing I want to mix that uses it. **TRASH 8**

**Pina Colada**

Tastes _exactly_ like one of the Pina Colada LifeSavers from the Life Savers tropical pack. Which, for the record, was the best flavor in that pack. I feel sure that they used LA Pina Colada to make that particular LifeSaver, or at the very least LifeSavers and LA hired the same flavor guy to create them. It's too uncannily identical for there to not be some sort of flavorist incest going on here. If you haven't had a pina colada lifesaver, there's no rum flavor, it's just pineapple and coconut candy. The pineapple is present but thin, the coconut is sweet and has a richness that other pineapple/coconut candies don't tend to have, like it's almost buttery. The whole thing is very sweet and has some depth to it. I'm not really sure if it has a hard candy body or if my brain is just forcing that on me because of how much this tastes like a pina colada LifeSaver. If you think pina colada lifesaver vape might be some sweet nostalgia for you, you might want to pick it up.

The only public recipe on ATF that uses it is my own, [Blue Razz Ring Pop](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/192260-blue_razz_ring_pop), which sounds amazing right now. **TASK 10**

It has only one review, which suggests subbing LB Blue Raspberry for the WF Sour Blue Raspberry Candy I used. I'll do that and try them side by side. **TASK 11**

**Plum**

Spiced peach and grape. Soft peach-grape flavor with a hint of spice that tastes like a clove/cinnamon blend. Starts out tasting like a soft already chewed grape gum, gradually shifts to more of a natural, cooked peach with just a hint of spice. **TRASH 9**

**Pomegranate Natural**

Darker, sweeter pomegranate flavor, tastes very purple. Missing that tarter top note but tastes like it would do a good job of filling out the bottom half of a pomegranate. Or, for that matter, a raspberry, blackberry, blueberry, or any really dark berry. Not soapy at 4% but tastes like it could go soapy pretty quick if the concentration were cranked up. Tried cranking the wattage up and it did get maybe just a touch soapy with the extra heat. It's not bad, but it's not one I have a reason to keep, either. **TRASH 10**

**Pumpkin**

This might not be safe to vape, because it contains caprylic capric triglyceride, which is not water soluble. I can't recommend using it for that reason. But if I have to tell you honestly what it tastes like, it's actually a nicely balanced pumpkin spice mix at 0.25%, I actually got a balance of all the cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, and ginger that pumpkin spice is supposed to have. Could be very useful for something other than vaping. **TRASH 11**

**Raspberry**

This is about as mediocre as a raspberry flavor can be. Very slightly sweet, candish red raspberry that's a little tart. Doesn't have much going for it. Flat and dull underneath slight tartness. Softer flavor, also kinda thin, not a lot of body to it. I don't see how this could possibly work as a main raspberry but maybe as some kind of background flavor it would be ok. I think I'll be ok without it. **TRASH 12**

**Sparkling Wine**

I really didn't know what to expect from LA Sparkling Wine, but it's actually pretty solid. Has that kind of mineral taste that sort of mimics carbonation, kind of, on top of a not-really-boozy but slightly fermented grapey white wine flavor, and a very syrupy sweet base. Other flavors do the bubbles better but this has otherwise nailed the taste of a very sweet champagne.

I want to try it as a substitute for FA Wine Champagne in this [Old Dogs, Children, and Watermelon Wine](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/53825-old_dogs_children_and_watermelon_wine) recipe. **TASK 12**

**Strawberry**

Bottom shelf Dollar Store strawberry jelly. It's a very jammy strawberry but it tastes like someone tried to save money by making jelly out of as little strawberry juice as possible or out of cheap out of season strawberries without much flavor to them. Full, sweet jammy body and thick, smooth mouthfeel, but a badly muted or weak strawberry flavor... unless I was starting to go blind when tasting this one or it needs a lot more than 4%. Nothing I want to make uses it. **TRASH 13**

**Strawberry Kiwi**

Sharp, tart fruity top note, not really kiwi or strawberry, just fruity, with a bland and paper-y off note. It tastes like some sort of artificial green strawberry flavor and cotton candy sweetness are the off notes and the main flavor is cardboard, not dark corrugated cardboard, but like white posterboard with some fruit. It's not very good. **TRASH 14**

**Watermelon**

It's pink. **TRASH 15**

**Watermelon (Colorless)**

Candy watermelon without any real watermelon in it. People say it tastes like watermelon jolly rancher but those have a lot more in-your-face flavor and tartness than you can get with any amount of LA Watermelon. This is more of an off-brand sugar free watermelon-flavored lollipop. It's very flat and one-dimensional but still a nice candy watermelon that does well to candy up melons and other fruits. Does have a strong jolly rancher room note, but I find when vaping it that it's softer than that and just not as punchy. For me, it also needs a short steep for a bit of harshness to die down.

LA Watermelon is a pretty solid flavor with lots of good and good-looking recipes that use it, but I ran out of it recently and with apologies to any recipes I'd already planned to mix that incorporate it, I think I'm going to get rid of it in the easiest way, by just not ordering more. I don't really need it, not when I have PUR Watermelon, WF Sour Watermelon Candy, and others. **TRASH 16**
