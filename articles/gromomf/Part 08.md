## CAPELLA

**Apple Pie**

Update. I really liked [42nd Bourbon](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/30130#42nd_bourbon_by_nachef) and left it a well-deserved 5/5 stars. But “keeping a flavor just to be able to make more” is typically going to be a nearly impossible 6/5 rating, and it falls short of being something that out-of-control good, to my taste. And it would have been my only reason for keeping CAP Apple Pie on hand. So, bye bye Miss CAP Apple Pie. **TRASH 1**

**Apple Pie V2**

Update. I just made [an easy little recipe](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/290169#4321_apple_pie_bourbon_by_id10_t) out of this! Success! And when it runs out, I think I would like to make some more. CAP Apple Pie V2 is sticking around for at least until I don't have any more of it (might not be worth replacing).

In the meantime, I'll try someone else's recipe with it.

[Apple Pie A La Mode V1](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/223190#apple_pie_ala_mode_v1_by_alch3m1st) **TASK 1**

**Sweet Blend**

CAP calls it “A delightful fruity blend with notes of cherry, berries, pineapple and a smooth anise eucalyptus finish.” I did not get exactly that. Tastes like horehound cough drops or a combination of anise and light menthol, mixed with tart berries and simple syrup. I don't get the eucalyptus finish they're talking about, but maybe I'm taking the word “finish” too literally. What I get is menthol up front, with a strong hit of anise, then tart berry syrup. Does a warm and cool thing at first with the menthol and warm spice. Sweetness builds and it has a very sweet finish. It tastes very European.

It pretty much tastes like adding CAP Anise and light touch of menthol to FW Beetle Juice. Which is why I'm inclined to **TRASH 2** it. If I wanted a blend of fruits and spices and menthol I would make my own.

**Sweet Candy**

I've tried some people's recipes that had this in there but I don't think I've ever gotten around to single-flavor testing it. And I don't recall whether I could tell what it was doing to those recipes. I'll mix samples at 0.75% and 2% **TASK 2**

And might as well try some recipes while I've got it out.

[PEZ](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/221090#pez_developed_by_developed) **TASK 3**

[Peach Slush](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/162177#peach_slush_developed_by_developed) **TASK 4**

**Sweet Cream**

It's a sweet, creamy, smooth heavy dairy cream that's just a little buttery. It's mostly just a very plain sweetened heavy cream. And I've always thought it had a strange warmth to it, like slightly heated cream. 2% seems to be the sweet spot for it. 3% starts to get a little waxy and slightly cheesy in a cream cheese or Brie sort of way, but not Parmesan. 6% is way too much, it tastes like putrid margarine. There should be no trouble using this as the main or even only cream in a creamy recipe, but if the result tastes waxy, it might be due to the CAP Sweet Cream.

A super-staple flavor with which I'm in no hurry to part.

I need it to make more [PANK](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/184392#pank_milk_by_id10_t), which I will do now. **TASK 5**

More of my most favorite straight-up vanilla custard recipe to date [Yellow Matter Custard](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/97838#yellow_matter_custard_dripping_from_a_dead_dog_s_eye_by_lukeloop) **TASK 6**

And another one of my all-time favorites, [Notorious](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/37519#notorious_by_notcharlesmanson). I might, dare I say it, think about possibly somehow improving upon it this time around. **TASK 7**

**Sweet Currant**

I think this is gonna be a love-it-or-hate-it flavor. Personally, I'm firmly planting my freak flag right in the middle of the love it camp, but there is a deep and abiding funkiness to this flavor that some people are going to hate. Probably the same people who don't like that bit of funkiness that you get with flavors like FLV Pink Guava. It tastes more red than most of the other purple or mauve currant flavors, like a funky sort of strawberry-cranberry mix, not so grapey. It's a really bold, somewhat acidic tart berry flavor, but also has a deep and thick sticky syrupy sweet base, so it's a well-rounded, encompassing flavor with a lot going on. It's also nice and juicy, not at all dry for something so tart. 2% looks like it could take over a mix a little bit, but I could see 1% adding interesting accents to just about any fruit, especially strawberry, really any berry. Maybe grape.

My favorite Currant flavor!

What will I try with it?

[Cranberry Thumbprint](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/208509#cranberry_thumbprint_developed_by_developed) Looks pretty good to me, I have some concerns about 1% INW Biscuit that I probably wouldn't have if it were 0.5% or even 0.75% INW Biscuit, but this has rave reviews. It's also not at all what I would have thought to use Sweet Currant for, and that's got me interested. **TASK 8**

This [Thicket](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/202415#thicket_by_kontravention) looks awesome and much more like what kind of recipe I imagined when tasting CAP Sweet Currant solo. I'll give it a mix, too. **TASK 9**

**Sweet Guava**

One of my favorite flavors of all time. It primarily tastes just like that yummy sweet guava nectar that comes in a can. It has some off-notes as a standalone flavor – I get slight hints of grass and bubblegum – but those are easily covered up in a mix. The rest is this dense, sticky sweet but still juicy guava nectar. It works well down low as a sweet tropical thing and also works well to enhance all kinds of other fruits, berries, melons, mango, cherry, just about anything that will cover up rather than amplify that grassy bit.

I want to mix another one of my favorite recipes of all time, [Fiestas & Fiascos](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/14486#fiestas_and_fiascos_by_concreteriver) **TASK 10**

Another all-time favorite, [Green Bastard](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/153649#green_bastard_by_yippyo). **TASK 11**

I personally think [Bare Necessities](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/26487#bare_necessities_by_id10_t) is a very nice recipe, and I appreciate it getting me through the first round of that big mix-off years ago. But I don't want to make it again. What I want to to is make a mash-up of Bare Necessities and another of my own recipes, [1-2-3 Cranberry Sprite](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/86917#1_2_3_cranberry_sprite_by_id10_t). I'm not even going to adjust the concentrations, I'm literally just going to put these two 3-ingredient recipes into one bottle and see what happens.

Cran-Bare-y Nes-Sprite-ities (name needs some work, a little help here?) **TASK 12**

| Co. | Flavor        | %    |
| --- | ------------- | ---- |
| FA  | Pear          | 0.75 |
| FA  | Red Summer    | 2.25 |
| CAP | Sweet Guava   | 2.5  |
| FLV | Cranberry     | 1    |
| VT  | Fizzy Sherbet | 2    |
| CAP | Lemon Lime    | 3    |

I've been meaning to try [Rainforest](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/136775#rainforest_by_rockyharlow) for a long time. **TASK 13**

I would need this for [Counter Punch](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/154364#counter_punch_by_id10_t) , but here's the deal, I think WF Hawaiian Punch might have somewhat rendered this recipe obsolete. Recipe was designed to taste like Hawaiian Punch because none of the flavors that were available at the time that were supposed to taste like Hawaiian Punch really did. Then WF comes out with a Hawaiian Punch that tastes just the real deal. Counterpoint: WF Hawaiian Punch is pretty intensely harsh on my poor baby throat.

This seems like as good a time as any to see if one of these recipes that use WF Hawaiian Punch turn out too harsh for me, or whether the other flavors used minimize that somehow. It's not unheard of for a harsh flavor to be smoothed over by a smooth one.

[Hawaiian Blue](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/280219#hawaiian_blue_by_davidn2kl). Maybe coconut calms it **TASK 14**

[Lei'd in Hawaii](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/228362#lei_d_in_hawaii_by_sheerluck_ohms). Or maybe creams do. **TASK 15**

I'm pretty sure I tried, and loved, Kitty's [Melon Balls](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/158169#my_melon_balls_by_kittybit) but I apparently failed to leave it a review. It's been a long time so I'll mix some more and then rectify that. **TASK 16**

I'm working on getting rid of CAP Golden Pineapple, there's just one profile I need to know that I can create without it, Mango Colada. If I still have it hanging around when I get down to this task, I'll try some [Guava Colada](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/282157#guava_colada_by_theserialvapist). **TASK 17** (Maybe).

[Guava Peach](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/205213#guava_peach_by_sublimeice). I've learned not to sleep on very simple CAP Sweet Guava mixes. **TASK 18**

Speaking of which, [Goodness Gracious Guava](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/212367#goodness_gracious_guava_by_danielthevapeman). It's just Prickly Victory with waaaaaay less Prick. Sounds good to me! **TASK 19**

Edit: Also this [Waikiki Pog](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/214373#waikiki_pog_by_x5w15hx). I like to see someone following the path of the real POG and not just trying to clone a POG-inspired juice. Plus that's obviously going to be tasty, even it does look like it could use a little less Sweet Tangerine and a little bit of WF Orange Juice, FA Royal Orange, OoO Orange Juice, or maybe FM Orange to make it more orangey. **TASK 19.5**

I'm going to have to buy some more Sweet Guava to get through all these.

**Sweet Lychee**

This is a good flavor, and also probably the most versatile lychee flavor I've tried. It tastes like canned lychee, sweet and syrupy, with an appropriate, subtle, rose-like taste upfront, followed a base that tastes like a slightly funky tropical white grape with a hint of grapefruit-like citrus, except this is a little more like funky white grape jelly, it's so thick and syrupy sweet. Seems like the perfect lychee for something like a lychee slush drink like you might get at a boba place, but with the right mixing things you could probably sell it as real canned lychee. It's not my favorite lychee (FE Lychee is), but it is probably the best combination of available and approachable among lychee flavors.

Right now I think I could live without CAP Sweet Lychee, but I've been meaning to try this classic [Sakura Sweets](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/37267#sakura_sweets_by_kopel) recipe for ages and just never got around to it. I will get around to it now. **TASK 20**

**Sweet Mango**

Useful and recognizable as a mango but has serious problems. Perfumy inhale and start of the exhale, overripe sweetness borderline on rotten, a little weirdly buttery down real low in the base. Can be used for filling out other mangoes at low %, overripeness can be covered up in a mix but not easily (CAP Lemon Lime and CAP Jelly Candy are both great for that). Thick. Not creamy, but like fleshy or maybe chewy.

I want to chuck this in the garbage, because that is what we do with inferior mangos.

On the other hand, I'm grateful to it for making it possible for me to create some things I wouldn't have been able to create without it. FLV Sweet Mango tastes like it was designed to put CAP Sweet Mango out of business and should be successful at that. I'm already working on replacing CAP Sweet Mango in my [Mango Colada](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/12259#mango_colada_by_id10_t), [Spicy Icy](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/116249#spicy_icy_chamoyada_mangonada_by_id10_t), and [Mango Tango](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/29425#mango_tango_by_id10_t) recipes with FLV Sweet Mango and/or other mango flavors like FLV Ripe Mango and FA Indian Mango. It's safe from being tossed out until those efforts come to fruition. In the meantime, I would also like to know I can make a great Mango Ice Cream without it. I'll start fairly simple and see where that leads.

Mango Ice Cream V1 **TASK 21**

| Co. | Flavor            | %   |
| --- | ----------------- | --- |
| WF  | Vanilla Ice Cream | 3   |
| TFA | Vanilla Swirl     | 2   |
| SSA | Ice Cream Vanilla | 1   |
| FLV | Sweet Mango       | 2   |
| FLV | Mango             | 1   |

Might come back later with some FA Violet and try to make that a purple mango.

And I would also like a Banana-Papaya-Mango recipe reminiscent of Philosopher's [Bamanaya](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/9401#bamanaya_by_philosaphucker) from six years ago that uses CAP Sweet Mango. But I want it simplified. Sleek. Modern.

1-2-3 Bamanaya V1 **TASK 22**

| Co. | Flavor         | %   |
| --- | -------------- | --- |
| TFA | Papaya         | 1   |
| FLV | Ripe Mango     | 2   |
| VT  | Banana Custard | 3   |

Notice neither of my CAP Sweet Mango tasks involve actually using CAP Sweet Mango. This flavor very much has one foot out the door.

**Sweet Strawberry**

I find it needs a short steep. Can't really shake and vape it. I get kind of a chemically off note from it and a little harshness until it steeps for a day or three. After it steeps, no chemically note or any harshness at all. Very sweet and unapologetically artificial, with some tartness to it, like a melted strawberry jolly rancher, but duller than that. Some depth to that sweet-tart dichotomy but no other complexity to it, just a plain strawberry candy flavor.  
ATF has like 600 recipes with this stuff in it. But there are so many better strawberries now, and I can't think of a recipe I need it for. Grack Juice was a wild ride but I've been on that roller coaster a few times and don't feel a great need to stand in line for it again.
There are just a couple I think I'd better try before I go tossing it, but after this, I'm only keeping it if I simply cannot live without one of these three recipes.

[Pink Eye](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/45045#pink_eye_by_mrburgundy) **TASK 23**

[Hula](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/121397#hula_by_eyemakepizza) **TASK 24**

[God Nect@r](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/253256#god_nect_r_by_dave80)**TASK 25**

**Sweet Tangerine**

Sweet, syrupy versatile vibrant sharp tangerine flavor. Very candied and artificial, think tangerine lollipop, not so much inherently juicy as mouthwatering like candy. People say it tastes like Tang but I think it's way more specifically tangerine than that, but maybe some other tangerine drink mix would be accurate. After it's mixed, not the powder. It's not powdery at all. Also has some mild throat hit as is typical for citrus.
I require it to make [Titanic](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/48608#titanic_by_id10_t), [In A Godda Da Vida](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/26946#in_a_godda_da_vida_by_mlnikon), and my tribute to In A Godda Da Vida, [Goddaron](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/95356#goddaron_by_id10_t). Mmmm Goddaron sounds really good right now, I'm going to mix some of that up. **TASK 26**

I turned 11 in 1990 so I'm also really interested in this [Sharkleberry Fin](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/92070#sharkleberry_fin_by_gachatay) recipe. **TASK 27**

**Sweet Tea**

This has been discontinued for a long time. Shame, it was a good one. Oh well, guess I'll just keep using TFA Sweet Tea at 10% and up. **TRASH 3**

**Sweet Watermelon**

Slightly perfumey, very slightly soapy, candy watermelon, kind of like under-sweetened watermelon koolaid except for the aforementioned off notes. Not especially sweet, but has a syrupy body. Little bit of throat hit. May have a place down low for filling out a watermelon candy or gum flavor but not great by itself. I've got so many better watermelon flavors. **TRASH 4**

**Tangy Orange**

Blatantly candied orange flavor with some fairly prominent vanilla behind it. Basically tastes like an orange tic-tac and a vanilla marshmallow dissolved with a drop of battery acid and half a shot of water. It is very acidic and has some tang to it, but it's not full Sour Patch Kids-level or anything like that. I know some people find it to be especially harsh, but I don't think it has any more throat hit than the average citrus. It's a little bitey on top, but that vanilla finish smooths it out for me. I also don't actually find it to be all that flavorful overall; it tastes like it's doubling back on itself and muting itself a bit. Not terrible, but also not one of my better orange flavors. **TRASH 5**

**Tart Cherry**

It's very dull, a bit harsh, and a little cough syrupy, but I did not get any of the new vinyl shower curtain flavor. Top end has a brighter, tart, candy flavor but that hint of darker cough syrup on the end gives it more of a “wild cherry” candy flavor overall. However, wild cherry candy tends to be a bold, penetrating flavor and this is very understated and thin, not saturated at all.

There are many cherry flavors that are way worse than this one, but I still don't care for it and don't feel like dealing with its nonsense. **TRASH 6**

**Toasted Almond**

More roasted than toasted. It's very roasted, almost smoky, and while I don't get anything I'd call off notes from it, I could see people who are more sensitive to whatever's making it so roasty getting a chemical Liquid Smoke type off note from it. It's also heavily focused on the roastiness, with the sweeter almond itself coming in almost as an afterthought and aftertaste, with just a bit of nuttiness upfront under all that roasted nut skin. It needs more almond to be an almond. But that might be a good thing that you could use it for just the roastedness and not the nut. Maybe use it to roast another nut that doesn't have that taste, like a peanut or hazelnut. Would absolutely like to see how it plays with various tobaccos.

Well, here's how it plays with some tobacco, in a recipe that looks terrific to me, at least on paper. [Autumn Leaves](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/55021#autumn_leaves_by_kriswk) **TASK 28**

And here goes Emily making me get into the FW Yellow Cake again: [Almond Pound Cake](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/205397#mlnikon_s_almond_pound_cake_by_mixinvixens). Why are you trying to kill me, Em? I thought we were friends. **TASK 29**

**Tropical Fruit Punch**

It's about 25% sweet red Hawaiian Punch and 75% new vinyl shower curtain. Someone at CAP is somehow immune to evil cherry nightmare bullshit plastic off note or they never would have put out this or their apocalyptic Grenadine disaster. There's really no sense even talking about what this does well, but it has a juicy beverage feel and that sweet soft artificial pineapple and red candy guava upfront and really tastes like Hawaiian punch for a second... and then the cherry plastic hits, and it hits hard. **TRASH 7**

**Vanilla Bean Ice Cream**

Somewhat buttery vanilla cream that's really more of an artificial French vanilla than Vanilla Bean. Less like a custard than other ice cream flavors, more milky, no rich custardy eggyness. The more of it you use, the thicker it gets, but even at 6% it's not as hefty and dense as a solid scoop of ice cream, more like a milkshake made out of cheap French vanilla ice cream, and 6% is the upper limit for me because it starts to taste chemically, like really cheap, crappy ice cream, beyond that.

195 Recipes on ATF and not one I can't live without, off the top of my head. But before I go tossing it, there are a couple I'd like to give a spin, just in case.

[Southern Butter Pecan Gelato](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/13706#southern_butter_pecan_gelato_v2_by_krucial) **TASK 30**

[Blondike](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/148669#blondike_icecream_sandwich_by_rupert) **TASK 31**

I would also need it if I wanted to mix more [Swashbuckle Shake](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/30515#swashbuckle_shake_by_id10_t) but really, I only did that recipe that way because of the parameters of the contest it was entered into. It got me through the milkshake round, by the skin of my teeth. How would I do this now, with years more experience, lots more flavors, and NO RULES? I would do it similarly, but not by using CAP Vanilla Bean Ice Cream.

Swashbuckle Up V1 **TASK 32**

| Co. | Flavor            | %   |
| --- | ----------------- | --- |
| CAP | Milkshake         | 4   |
| WF  | Vanilla Ice Cream | 3   |
| TFA | Vanilla Swirl     | 2   |
| SSA | Ice Cream Vanilla | 1   |
| TFA | Coconut Candy     | 2   |
| FA  | Jamaican Rum      | 2   |

I could maybe use WF Coconut Rum instead of the two flavors for coconut rum, but TFA Coconut Candy is so sweet I think this might not need sweetener (it probably would with WF Coconut Rum), and FA Jamaican Rum tastes like a higher quality rum, not straight-up Parrot Bay like WF Coconut Rum. Although, it is possible that the malty aspect of CAP Milkshake would create the impression of a better rum. Shit. I'd better give that a try.

Swashbuckle Up V2 **TASK 33**

| Co. | Flavor            | %   |
| --- | ----------------- | --- |
| CAP | Milkshake         | 4   |
| WF  | Vanilla Ice Cream | 3   |
| TFA | Vanilla Swirl     | 2   |
| SSA | Ice Cream Vanilla | 1   |
| WF  | Coconut Rum       | 3   |

**Vanilla Cupcake**

Under-sweetened commercial French Vanilla frosting. There's a tub of French Vanilla frosting in the bakery aisle of my local grocery store that tastes similar to this, but sweeter. It IS sweet, just not as sweet as eating frosting with a spoon. It has that oily thick feel of mass-produced frosting made with soybean oil under that vanilla. There's something in there that might be a hint of white cake but it's almost entirely just frosting.

Pretty innocuous flavor. Not offensive at all. It probably used to be the best option for any kind of frosting but we have many more now. All that matters to me is, is there a recipe I need it for? Maybe. I'll try one and see.

[Slow Deicide](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/105311#slow_deicide_by_mlnikon) **TASK 34**

**Vanilla Cupcake V2**

I don't get any barfy notes from it. I don't think they took out the dikey tones and replaced it with puke. I think they just took them, and also changed the vanilla. It's still almost entirely frosting, but it's a very bright, deeply saturated, and blatantly artificial vanilla with a creamy but slightly dry frosting flavor. Vanilla is almost obnoxious here. It's dense and sweet but not greasy or very buttery. A little undersweet for frosting, but sweet.Underneath that there's some white cakey flavor, more than V1, but it's very light. I give this one an edge over V1 just because of how much of a vibrant punch that vanilla has and how it's a little more cakey, even though it's still almost all frosting. It's just that between CAP Frosting, FLV Frosting, WF and VT butter cream frostings, I just don't feel like I need this. I will give one recipe a try.

[Toast My Ass](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/35326#toast_my_ass_by_folkart) How does this have zero reviews? **TASK 35**

**Vanilla Custard**

Eggy, rich, buttery, unmistakable, unique French Vanilla-type flavor that I call Capella Vanilla. It has a kind of oily quality that turns some people off right away, and in the large concentrations needed for a custard recipe fully built around it, needs badly to steep not only to blossom into it's full self but to not have an overly greasy and almost plasticky weirdness. It's also a flavor that people get tired of because it's so ubiquitous. It's so recognizable as to be distracting, like, ok, that tastes like CAP Vanilla Custard. Not vanilla custard, but CAP Vanilla Custard specifically. Maybe I'm just weird, but that's kind of annoying (though not as much as waiting a week or two or four for it to steep). But unless you're turned off by the oiliness or tired of it or impatient (or maybe you just don't like that specific vanilla in your vanilla custard), it's perfect. And worth having around anyway, because it's versatile and small amounts of it turn up in some really interesting and unexpected places. Has a proven versatility.

Of course I'm not ready to toss CAP Vanilla Custard, even though there are at least four or five custards I'd rather use. No particular recipe stands out in my mind, but there are 1000s of recipes that use it, surely I'd be missing out on something fantastic if I tossed it. I'll try some new things, or new-to-me things, and see if I can find something specific that makes CAP Vanilla Custard impossible to part with.

[Peanut Butter RY4 Cookie](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/167806#peanut_butter_ry4_cookie_developed_by_developed) - I'll be subbing JF Cookie for the FA in there and in a few others. **TASK 36**

[Nobleman Pistachio Pudding](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/69229#nobleman_pistachio_pudding_by_steamon) **TASK 37**

[Nana Pudding](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/124686#nana_pudding_by_alfredpudding) **TASK 38**

[Mama J's Game Over Custard](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/103411#mama_js_game_over_custard_by_wllmc) **TASK 39**

[Malted Vanilla Custard](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/107294#malted_vanilla_custard_by_silky) **TASK 40**

[123 Mint Cookie Custard](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/123083#123_mint_cookie_custard_by_shakenvape007) **TASK 41**

One of these recipes is going into my private hall of fame, I just know it. Don't know which one yet, but one of them. Surely.

**Vanilla Custard V2**

Freshly mixed, it tastes like you drank CAP Vanilla Custard, puked it up, then went ahead and made some juice out of your puked up vanilla custard flavoring mingled with sour stomach acid. Nasty, right? At two weeks' steep, it's not quite vomity anymore, but it does still have just a touch of off-putting sourness, like the sourness of dirty socks or armpits, but just the sourness without the rest of the taste of those things. After about a month, that sourness dies down to the point that it can easily be covered up in a mix, especially one with a fruit or two in there. It has that unique warm, darkly sweet “yellow” vanilla that's only exactly found in a few Capella flavors, including CAP French Vanilla and CAP Vanilla Custard V1. It will never get as rich and buttery as diketone custards but it is already rich and thick after a couple days and it does get fuller and thicker over time.

My only reason for keeping this would be if I wanted to try to clone or create a commercial recipe. There are tons of commercial recipes that use this. But since I no longer have any interest in doing either of those things, **TRASH 8**

**Vanilla Milk Froth**

CAP VMF wasn't a ton of fun to vape standalone, but I think if you want an authentic vanilla milk froth for something like a coffee drink, this will do it. It's a little bland upfront, but the finish is exactly what it says it is. Unless it steeps into straight butter eventually like VT Coffee Milk Froth does, this is your froth milk flavor, it really captures what the frothing does to the taste of the milk, plus a light amount of brighter than average vanilla. So as a flavor by itself, kinda sucky, as a tool, definitely worth looking into if you're into that sort of thing.

I've found I don't really care to vape coffee, not even the ones that aren't too bad, which seems like it would rule out keeping Vanilla Milk Froth. But what I do love to do is to find or create recipes that make a great first vape of the day and pair especially well with my morning coffee.

I think I might have found one using Vanilla Milk Froth! Or at least one that's worth a try.

[Cruel Inventions](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/262639#cruel_inventions_vanilla_milk_steamer_by_lynda_marie) **TASK 42**

**Vanilla Whipped Cream**

It's velvety smooth and creamy, with a bright, artificial-tasting vanilla, similar to CAP's Simply Vanilla, rather than the darker CAP Vanilla Custard Vanilla. Some heavy cream buttery taste but mostly just creamy vanilla. Some sweetness here, but not much, not enough for a whipped cream, really. Fairly dense, voluminous mouthfeel.

I love this flavor. It doesn't do “whipped cream on top” well at all, but does really good at mixing other cream type flavors together, though, and works really well as a mouth-feel additive for things like white chocolate flavors, which can be kinda chalky without it. Which is why I needed it to make [GTKK 2019](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/136863#gtkk_2019_by_id10_t), which sounds great to me right now. **TASK 43**

But, I do have to ask myself whether it's time for GTKK 2022 (or 2023 by the time I get around to finishing such a thing). MB White Chocolate, WF White Chocolate (Milky Cream), MF White Chocolate are all options I have now, so I'm just not entirely sure that the combination of FW White Chocolate, FLV White Chocolate, and CAP Vanilla Whipped Cream is still the best possible white chocolate component I can build here. What do you think?

**Wafer Crunch**

Now, this one I don't have to wonder about. WF Crispy Wafer is STILL the best wafer for that profile, or at least the best one I've tried. CAP Wafer Crunch tastes like... Shitty WF Crispy Wafer. The taste is very similar, they both taste just like a nutty bar without the chocolate or peanut butter... so, just a wafer... but CAP's version is softer in the sense of being less flavorful and harder in the sense of tasting slightly burnt. I'm not going looking for recipes. I don't even care what you degenerates are using this for, if you weren't utterly tasteless you would have reached for the WF instead. It's bullshit garbage behavior to put out a brand new flavor that tastes very much like an existing flavor but is notably inferior to it. Shame on Capella for doing that. You know the way Jungle Flavors seems to put out flavors that taste remarkably similar to other companies' existing flavors, but better to at least some degree? Well, this is Capella pulling a reverse JF on us. I won't stand for it. Wow, that's a lot of words when only one is needed: **TRASH 9**

**Whipped Marshmallow**

Not a fan. It's sort of vaguely terrible. It's a soft, dull flavor and has a little bit of a tangy, almost cheesy or almost spoiled milk type of note to it, under a very plain vanilla, and light sweetness. **TRASH 10**

**Wild Cherry With Stevia**

I made myself a note after sampling this at 5% that I should try it again at 2.5% and never got around to it. I'll do that now. **TASK 43**

At 5% This one is not too terribly bad. The new vinyl shower curtain thing is there, but really really light for the amount of flavor I get. Lots of flavor, very little plastic. It tastes like an artificial black cherry flavor. Dark. Much more like the candy or soda flavor called “black cherry” than the somewhat brighter and more tart “wild cherry.” Lighter on the offnotes than FA or FW black cherries. It also seems a little grapey, as well as slightly waxy. Very sweet sugar lips sweet finish with just the barest touch of that stevia bittersweetness. I might try to use low as a sweetener for a dark cherry thing if I wanted that, or for a grape maybe. Better black cherries? INW Black Cherry Tobacco, OoO Black Cherry, maybe WF Black Cherry Jelly Bean all seem like better black cherries compared to 5% CAP Wild Cherry With Stevia. But since there's plenty of flavor at 5%, trying it lower is to see if there could still be enough flavor without getting any plastic at all.

While I've got it out anyway, I'll try a simple recipe and see how that shakes out. I'm missing a couple of ingredients for this [Cola Cola](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/229507#cola_cola_by_darthy) but it deserves major credit if this works out. I tried SSA Cola along with so many other SSA flavors in such a short period of time that I had forgotten SSA Cola is a thing, which I have, that is pretty awesome, compared to so many inferior cola flavors. Seeing that recipe reminded me of it.

1-2-3 Cherry Vanilla Coke **TASK 44**

| Co. | Flavor                       | %   |
| --- | ---------------------------- | --- |
| FA  | Madagascar (Vanilla Classic) | 1   |
| CAP | Wild Cherry w/ Stevia        | 2   |
| SSA | Cola                         | 3   |

That's probably going to need another cola or something similar to fill it in if I want to finish it out fully, but I'll worry about that later.

**Yellow Cake**

So I can tell it's definitely supposed to be a cake, but it's weird. There's a strange sort of spice note in there, close but not identical to anise, with some vanilla behind it. It's sweet and not dry but also fairly light and airy and not especially rich and buttery like I'd expect from a yellow cake. Kinda flat. There's another weird and drier note in the end, where it tastes kind of like raw flour. You can probably make some good stuff out of it, especially if you cover that anise-type thing with another strong spice like cinnamon or maybe some other strong top note, but it's a pretty weird flavor.

I will try this [Simply Rollin'](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/25482#simply_rollin_by_coop34) because I bet all that Rich Cin simply steamrolls those off notes. **TASK 45**

However, I also bet I can do it better. So at the same time, I'll mix this:

Keep it Simply Rollin V1 **TASK 46**

| Co. | Flavor                     | %    |
| --- | -------------------------- | ---- |
| CAP | Sticky Bun                 | 5    |
| FLV | Rich Cinnamon              | 0.15 |
| OoO | Vanilla Custard Cheesecake | 2    |

Now, if I wanted to do it _even_ better than that, I'd start by trying add something to enhance the brown sugar notes - maybe FLV Caramel - and maybe add some butter. But that is not the name of the game. The name of the game is, apparently, “three-ingredient frosted cinnamon roll without using FW Cinnamon Roll for... reasons.” I'm going to win that game, watch.

And this [Kryptonite](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/266889#kryptonite_by_mixnjuice) because it only uses a teensy bit of it mixed with a bunch of tasty stuff, and because the “it's not supposed to be anything but yummy, really” aspect appeals to me. **TASK 47**

**Yellow Peach**

A fresher, more natural peach, but kinda dry, not juicy, like an out of season or underripe peach, and maybe a little harsher than either TFA or CAP Juicy peaches to me. Not very sweet, slightly floral which is actually accurate for a skin on yellow peach, a bit citrisy, understated sort of light on flavor intensity, but not bad. Kind of thin, not a lot of thick fleshy body to it.

I need it for [Counter Punch](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/154364#counter_punch_by_id10_t) and will make some of that now. **TASK 48**

What else should I try, while I've got it out?

[Ultra Peach Tea](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/273565#ultra_peach_tea_by_vivavape) looks good. **TASK 49**

The notes are... odd. But the recipe looks great. Peach mango dragonfruit? Yes please. [And now a word from our sponsor!](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/270061#and_now_a_word_from_our_sponsor_by_chumbles) **TASK 50**

And that's it for my first pass through my Capella collection. Of course they'll keep coming up as I mix and vape my way through this massive task list, but in the meantime I'll move on to some smaller selections of lesser-used flavors out of Germany and the UK.

New Flavor Count: 2,869 (Nice!)
