# CAPELLA

**Meringue**

Update. My first shot at trying to make something out of CAP Meringue wasn't what I'd hoped it would be. I wanted a strawberry-kiwi pavlova starring meringue and wound up with a blended (no real separation between the fruits) strawkiwi thing that mostly overtook the meringue. I've vaped my way though most of the bottle while thinking about how to fix it, but have reached the conclusion that it's not a profile I care enough about to continue working on. And, finding nothing else I want to mix that uses it, I think I'll be ok without CAP Meringue in my arsenal. **TRASH 1**

**Milkshake**

Update. My first attempt to make something out of CAP Milkshake was very successful, both in terms of tasting great and tasting like a vanilla milkshake. All I did was add 4% CAP Milkshake to my [1-2-3 VIC](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/215957-123_vic) recipe. The result is probably good enough to make public on ATF now, but I still think there's room for improvement, so:

VIC Milkshake v2 **TASK 1**

| Co. | Flavor            | %    |
| --- | ----------------- | ---- |
| CAP | Milkshake         | 4    |
| WF  | Vanilla Ice Cream | 3    |
| TFA | Vanilla Swirl     | 2    |
| SSA | Ice Cream Vanilla | 1    |
| TFA | Whipped Cream     | 1    |
| FW  | Sweetener         | 0.25 |
| BCF | WS23 (30%)        | 0.13 |

I think it could benefit from the mouthfeel powerhouse that is TFA Whipped Cream (triacetin, baby). Now that it's already good, a little sweetener can't hurt. And I want to cautiously add a tiny bit of cooling, not enough to mess with what's already good (hopefully) or make it cold, cold, but just enough to (hopefully) give it the vague impression of coolness, because nobody wants to drink a hot milkshake.

**New York Cheesecake V2**

Update. I tried one recipe to see if I needed to keep this and while the strawberry layer was the best strawberry cheesecake strawberry layer I've ever tried, the cheesecake part was just a little too cheesy for my taste. Too sour-milk sour, kinda yucky. And I think that is entirely CAP NY Cheesecake V2's fault, so fuck this shit, it's going in the **TRASH 2**

# MOLINBERRY

**Dark Blackberry**

At 0.5%, it tastes like deodorant. Not just generically “perfumy” - it specifically tastes like women's deodorant more than anything. There's a little bit of dark berry in here but it's at least 95% deodorant, like licking the freshly-deodorized armpits of a female berry farmer. 0.25% is better, more like 50/50 deodorant/berry ratio, but not a lot of flavor there, and that dark berry isn't very sweet and isn't clearly a blackberry. **TRASH 3**

**Dark French Coffee**

4% tastes like sweetened, cold coffee, bittersweet. You know how when you accidently take a sip of cold coffee, it's kinda off-putting? But it's accurate in that way. It's a little chocolately, like extra extra dark chocolate, but no skunk spray, burnt popcorn, full-on dirt, or any of that type of thing that happens with coffee flavors. Slightly light flavor at 4%, I'm guessing a better range for this is around 6 or 7%. I'll mix a sample at 6.5%. **TASK 2**

**EM Formula**

It's supposed to be Red Bull, but it tastes more like generic energy drink flavor and even leans more RockStar than Red Bull. It mostly tastes like lemon-lime soda mixed with cream soda and a hint of bubblegum. That melted sweet tart and battery acid top note is very subdued and more like Sprite, getting some sweet lemon lime with that kind of acidity but no other fruit flavors or that bitter energy drink edge. The body here is more cream soda with a hint of pink bubble gum and a little powdery, and then the pink bubblegum blossoms and lingers in the finish, though the lemon-lime never leaves. I thought it was a perfectly nice vape, more pleasant than most energy drink, but kind of odd and, as best I can tell, useless for emulating any IRL thing I might want to try to emulate. **TRASH 4**

**Epic Vanilla**

Haven't tried this one, will mix a sample at 2%. **TASK 3**

**Fantasy Grape**

Soft purple flavor, very artificial, like somewhat watered down Kool-Aid, but not too watered down, more flavorful than MB Queen Grapes, with a load of sweetness and a slight cooling effect. I'm not sure exactly what they're using for that cooling but it feels like a touch of FA Polar Blast, because it's that ending cooling on the lips, along with the sugar lips (I think there's some sucralose in there, but it's not as aggressive as Koolada. Whatever it is, it's so light that a lot of people who've reviewed or discussed it that I've seen never even mentioned it, so YMMV. I think it's not a bad cooled-down watered-down purple grape Kool-aid flavor. Still, I have better grapes. **TRASH 5**

**Fresh Coffee**

Weak. 4% barely tasted like anything at all to me, just a wisp of slightly bitter and dirty flavor. 8% tastes like a very watered down light roast coffee, with nothing off or gross, just a very weak flavor. I haven't tried it above 8% yet, but I will, because coffee flavors that don't taste off or gross are uncommon. Will mix a 12% sample. **TASK 4**

**Funky Pineapple**

It's super good. Very sweet and juicy. Digging into it a bit, there's a little funk there as well, not rotten oniony funk, but just a little natural tropical funk that makes it extra good and more realistic. A little soft for a pineapple, where big, bold flavor is more appropriate, but that's ok.

It's in one recipe I've already planned to mix, but here's several more that look great:

[Scooby Snack Drink](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/190484-scooby_snack_drink). Pineapple, banana, coconut, melon, and RUM. **TASK 5**

[Limbo](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/281246-limbo__public_release). Pineapple, papaya, lime, and RUM. **TASK 6**

[2 Tickets to Paradiso](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/203445-2_tickets_to_paradiso). Pineapples, grapefruit, and... candy? **TASK 7**

[Sugarloaf Soda](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/215211-sugarloaf_soda). Pineapple citrus soda, and I'm really interested in what that FA Oba Oba is doing in there. **TASK 8**

**Galaxy Cheesecake**

Apparently this is supposed to be a cheesecake “Full of berries, cookies, almonds and other delicious galactic matter!” Whatever that means. I did not really get all of that stuff, it's an extremely muddled mess, very disappointing. No repulsive off notes just not what it's supposed to be. Doesn't taste anything like cheesecake really although there is some fairly dense creaminess to it. Top notes taste sort of like a dark berry candy maybe and there's something bakery in there but not really a cookie crust to speak of. **TRASH 6**

**Glamour Chocolate**

Hazelnut. Right up front, hazelnut, clear as day. More hazelnut than chocolate, but there's some chocolate there that doesn't taste like crap. Doesn't come across like Nutella, where the chocolate and hazelnut are beautifully blended, more like eating a hazelnut that's half-dipped in chocolate in two bites, first the hazelnut half and then the chocolate-dipped half. The chocolate isn't exactly a milk chocolate, but isn't very dark, either. The chocolate isn't weird, it's creamy and chocolatey and works, I just don't know what to do with this if I don't want hazelnut on top of my chocolate.

It's used in three recipes I've already decided to try. Here's two more, a Kinder Bueno-esque [Toy Soldier](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/281937-toy_soldier) with a shit-ton of ingredients I hope I won't regret fishing out **TASK 9**

And on the other end of the number of ingredients spectrum, [All Night Long!](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/187435-all_night_long) which looks delicious and is just the MB Glamour Chocolate mixed with FLV Marshmallow and TFA DX Peanut Butter. **TASK 10**

**Grapefruit**

Very overly sweet but otherwise inoffensive grapefruit flavor. Rather than the natural sweetness of a pink grapefruit, it tastes more like putting sugar on a white grapefruit to sweeten it. Lots of sugar, almost to the point that I feel like what I'm vaping is supposed to grapefruit-flavored cotton candy. Slight zesty top note and beyond that just a lot of sweetness with light grapefruit flavor.

Not much different than CAP Grapefruit, but sweeter. Nothing like FW Ruby Red, FA Grapefruit, VT Grapefruit, or INW White Grapefruit, all of which have this beat.

I'm not sure I would use it for anything except possibly in lieu of sweetener in a grapefruit mix. I do have to add though that it's really smooth and might be a grapefruit for people who find other grapefruit flavors to be too harsh. **TRASH 7**

**Green Banana & Bamboo Milk**

It's bizarre, but not “bad.” I wasn't aware bamboo milk was a thing that existed and am still not convinced it does. I found some cosmetic products that appeared to be claiming to contain it, but that's about it. It does indeed taste like an underripe banana, but less astringent than that, on top of a cream that tastes similar to sweetened coconut milk but with an odd woody tone to it. It's unique as a whole, but I've had that same odd woody tone in one other place before, FLV Lemon Grass. This tastes like FLV Lemon Grass, but green banana-y instead of lemony, and with more of a milky creamy texture. I found it entirely pleasant, just odd. I don't know what the heck to do with it. **TRASH 8**

**Green Lime**

Have not tried. Will do a 2% sample. **TASK 11**

**Indulge**

It's supposed to be raspberry, caramel, vanilla, custard and cocoa. It tastes like a raspberry cream flavor. Thick-ish, but thin for a custard, more of a heavy cream with light vanilla, though I do get a hint of butter. There's something that might be a caramel or brown sugar, not really clear, with maybe some cocoa attached to it? The raspberry on top clearly comes across as a raspberry, but it's just a bit perfumy even at the low end of MB's recommended use range. Seems like the perfume would settle down at a lower amount, but then the creamy custard part would be less filled out. **TRASH 9**

**JD Whiskey**

Sweet whiskey flavor minus any booziness, with a slightly odd, meaty off note on top and weak, almost flavorless finish. Do not recommend. **TRASH 10**

**Legendary Custard**

It's a thick and sweet custard but has a really weird spice note like some sort of nutmeg anise hybrid behind its bright, forward vanilla. Creamy and with medium density, heavy on the milk but light on the butter and without any eggyness.

This is used in a couple of recipes I've already planned to make. When looking for more and found eight I wanted to try, then narrowed that down to three that I just _have_ to try.

[Mr. Highway](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/192643-mr_highway). Custard with honeycomb toffee and marshmallow. **TASK 12**

[Butterfly Effect](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/212559-butterfly_effect). “Complex nutty creamy goodness” **TASK 13**

[CV Master Custard](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/250699-cv_master_custard). Reviews sold this take on basic vanilla custard to me. **TASK 14**

**Lemon Tart**

What's this unopened bottle all about? I'll try a sample at 4%. **TASK 15**

**Malibu Pinacolada**

A pina colada made out of old pineapple juice. It's the complete package, real boozy rum flavor that hits on top and comes back around sweeter in the finish, with clear pineapple and coconut. Problem is the pineapple tastes like it's past its prime a bit. I don't want to say rotten pineapple because I reserve that for FA pineapple, but it doesn't taste fresh. It's got a bit of funk on it. Also, the coconut cream tastes as it should, but it's a bit dry for a beverage. It's a shame that the pineapple it's past the sell by date and coconut cream isn't all that creamy, because the rum part of this is on point. Nothing I want to make that uses it, **TRASH 11**

**Mellow Chili Mango**

Clearly mango, but little soapy, and a bit underripe. Not real piney, but overly citrusy. The chili flavor is also missing, there's just a little chili type warmth to the finish. It's bright and identifiable as mango, but not much deep ripe mango flavor. Very disappointing, because an actual chili mango flavor that really tastes like dried mango with spicy chili powder on it would be amazing. That bit of soapiness throughout is a huge turnoff for me. **TRASH 12**

**Nut Banana**

Pretty much just their Soft Banana - that mostly realistic but with a hint of candy/artificial banana - with a bit of a nondescript nuttiness. They say it's hazelnut. I guess it's as close to something like the hazelnut flavor in coffee creamer as it is to anything else, but really it's not clearly any specific type of nut, and it's just an accent. That little accent makes it more interesting and flavorful and I don't think it makes it much less versatile, it's light enough that I'm sure it would fit right into something like a banana milkshake recipe, just like a touch of FW Hazelnut does. It also distracts from the candy bit of the banana a bit, at least for me, and makes it more like a concentrated or exaggerated banana than a fake one. It also seems a bit sweeter than the Soft Banana. I dig this as a single flavor but there are two public recipes on ATF that use it, one I don't want to make and one I can't because I'm missing an ingredient. **TRASH 13**

**Original Lemonade**

Lemonheads candy. It tastes almost exactly like Lemonheads candy to me. Pretty similar to LA Lemonade, but more intense. Fair amount of citrus harshness, but not incongruous to the amount of flavor here. Tastes like recipes that use LA at 5 or 6% could use this at 3 or 4% and be about the same. Sweet, but it's that kind of sweetness that starts to feel a little dry over time. Could make a good lemonade with an additional, zesty lemon, and/or something wet, but there are better lemons and better lemonades to choose from. If you want to make lemonhead candy this is awesome, maybe just add a little deeper lemon like FE Lemon to finish it out. I'll be fine without it. **TRASH 14**

**Palm Coconut**

I got a very nutty coconut from MB Palm Coconut. Like a chocolate almond coconut candy bar minus the chocolate. Almost woody, but not quite a coconut-husk woodiness. More just generic nut flavor, leaning toward almond. Also really fleshy or meaty. Not coconut milk or coconut cream flavor. Very much the meat of the coconut, but not quite dry enough for coconut flakes and doesn't have that distinctive taste of dried coconut. It tastes like MB Palm coconut could be a really good realistic coconut if you could get around that almond taste, or great for something that has some almond taste in it, like a drink that uses coconut and Amaretto or Frangelico. Or bring in some chocolate for an Almond Joy-type recipe.

There are a few recipes that use this that look great to me, but the one that stands out the most is [banocconut bread](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/222221-banocconut_bread), described as “coconut with a slight banana bread back.” **TASK 16**

**Pink Lady**

By the name, I thought this was supposed to be a type of apple. But it turns out to be a weird tropical floral fruit... thing? I can't place the floral but it's upfront, with notes of passionfruit and guava and maybe a little apple behind it. This [Pink Lady Lemonade](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/226127-pink_lady_lemonade) looks really interesting, but I don't have enough Pink Lady left to make more than a small bottle. The flavor is fun and not offensive to me (I like floral stuff), but I don't want to buy more of it. **TRASH 15**

**Pink Raspberry**

At 3%, it's like Raspberry LaCroix. Just not a lot of flavor there. It's a bright and slightly floral but light and soft raspberry, not a bold flavor at all. Just a little tartness there. Tastes kind of candyish or artificial, because it tastes more “simple” than a natural raspberry. Thin. Not too sweet, but at the same time the sweetness that's there seems to be sucking the flavor out of it.

I think people who generally like things to be subtle and lightly flavored might love MB Pink Raspberry and should check it out, I'm just not a fan of candy-type flavors that aren't bold. It could also be that 3% is too low, but I'd be nervous to try it any higher because it's already a little floral at 3% and more just seems like it's going to go perfumy on me.

It might not be the best raspberry flavor, but it's used in one recipe I had already planned to try and now here's three more:

[Sweden: Prinsesstarta](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/133632-sweden_prinsesst%C3%A5rta). For one thing, it looks delicious. For another, reasonably detailed notes that include accurate (to my taste) descriptions of the flavors used are always a strong selling point, and this one says “MB Pink Raspberry provides a soft, lightly floral and tart contrast to the cake layers.” **TASK 17**

[Lemon Raspberry Crumble Cake](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/243727-lemon_raspberry_crumble_cake) also looks delicious. **TASK 18**

This one might be more interesting than yummy but [Hashirama](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/244033-hashirama) is something I want to try. Rhubarb Creamsicle.**TASK 19**

**Queen Delicate Pineapple**

Tastes like white gummy bear rather than actual pineapple, and there's a slight black licorice note in the sweet finish and after taste. If you want white gummy bear, there are plenty of other options - CAP 27 Bears, various Dragonfruit flavors - that don't have a licorice back note. But I guess if for some reason you do want white gummy bear and a hint of black licorice, this one might do it for you. Very sweet, has some nice body to it, and very legitimately tastes like a white gummy bear until you get down to the licorice. I suppose the licorice is light enough that you could cover it with something and just get the white gummy top note, but again, other options exist, I'd pass on this one.

The thing keeping me from tossing it is wanting to try Nick Evans' [Caribbean Crush](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/196097-caribbean_crush/). **TASK 20**

**Queen Grapes**

Another meh purple flavor, but moderately less meh than TFA Grape Juice. Bit more saturated, little deeper, and sweeter than TFA Grape Juice, but similar. Nothing wrong with it, just a bit bland. I have better grapes, though. **TRASH 16**

**Rainbow Sherbet**

Somewhat harsh (at least to me), mostly orangey citrus with some other fruit behind it, supposed to be raspberry and lime, I guess it tastes more like raspberry and lime than any other fruit combo, but it's muddled. The orange is clear though. It's kinda dry and doesn't really have a creamy feel or cream taste, but it is nice and sweet.

Other than what's supposed to be raspberry and lime instead being pretty muddled up, there's not anything I'd call an off note in MB Rainbow Sherbet. It seems like you could add some cream, a little more raspberry and lime to bump that up equal to the orange, and if you're not a baby throat, it would make a pretty good rainbow sherbet.

Worth noting that MB Rainbow Sherbet is a little weak in concentration. They recommend 8% I think. I tried it at 7% and that certainly wasn't a super bold flavor, it all tastes a little soft after the orange upfront. I don't need it. **TRASH 17**

**Red Cherry**

Some of the notes others have left about this one suggest it does not have any off notes at 4% after it steeps for a month. I haven't tried giving it a month, but at six days at 2.5%, it has a little cough syrup with a side of new vinyl shower curtain. Off notes aside, it's a brighter and sweeter kind of cherry, deeper with a thick syrupy base and more saturation than a lot of other flavors. Not a natural cherry, but like an artificially flavored cherry syrup.

I tried a recipe with it at 3% steeped for two weeks that did not have these terrible off-notes, [Don't Call Me Shirley](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/151588-dont_call_me_shirley). Impressive recipe, not quite going on the list of personal faves.

I'll probably wind up tossing the flavor, but before I do, I need to try [Big Dilly](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/307861-big_dilly). I don't think I've ever used that much FA Oba Oba before, I want to see what it does. I'll sub FW Sweetener for the PUR Super Sweet, which I don't have. **TASK 21**

**Red Dragon Grape**

I think that's supposed to be red grapes and dragonfruit but the bottle says red grapes and dragon wings, which, I don't know what dragon wings taste like, but ok. It's very sweet and mostly tastes like red grapes, but there's something else going on there, like a slightly floral, yet syrupy pineapple. Hibiscus-infused pineapple syrup poured over red grapes, maybe? It's odd, but not unpleasant. As best I can tell without being familiar with all the ingredients, “The Grape Passion of The Christ” by EyeMSam on ATF is a great-looking recipe. But I lack the CNV Grapefruit to mix it. Without another recipe that I can mix, I think it's time to say goodbye to Red Dragon Grape. **TRASH 18**

**Shape Up! Pear**

I think this is not only a great pear flavor, but one of the best, if not the best, Molinberry flavor I've tried. MB Shape Up has everything I want in a pear. Some things perhaps not as much as I want, or more than I want, for some mixes, but without combining two (or more) flavors together, I don't think it gets any much better than this.

MB Shape Up Pear is bold and sweet and juicy and crisp, with a lot of apple-like texture and body, and just a little earthy realism, all fairly well balanced, and smooth. No off notes for me after steeping for almost a week but that pear skin thing can be a little overbearing off a shake. The boldness takes it away from being natural a bit. It's not so much fake-tasting as it is just... exaggerated? Using it lower and mixing with other pears could help with realism. On the other hand, I think this exaggerated pear flavor could work with some candy flavor or flavors to create that Jelly Belly Juicy Pear Jelly Bean which is the best of the Jelly Belly beans (fight me).

I need it for one of my own recipes, [Falkor](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/129644-falkor). It's also in a couple of recipes I've already planned to try.

Here's one more that looks super yummy, not so much for the pear but combination of TFA Bavarian Cream, FA Jamaican Rum, and OoO Marshmallow (Vanilla) is giving me a semi. [Seven Sins: Pride](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/239590-seven_sins_pride). **TASK 22**

**Sharp Blackcurrant**

Concentration-wise, the flavor is a bit light at the 3% I sampled and would probably try cranking it up a little higher if I wanted it to be the main flavor. I didn't bother because of what I was getting at 3%, I didn't want more of. It is indeed sharp, and quite a bit throaty. Not really tart, it's more vinegary than tart, but more like apple cider vinegar rather than straight up douche water. I think it might just be malic acid giving it that quality? It vapes like too much TFA Sour. Underneath that, there's a sweet sort of grape-raspberry thing going on, but it's light this low and seems to need more to be filled out.

I like other currant flavors quite a bit more than this one and don't feel compelled to do anything with it. **TRASH 19**

**Shock**

It's from their M-line which means it's meant to be a one shot, and it's a very complex flavor that MB describes as:

“The best of strawberry juice, citrus fresh lime, seasonal forest berries and perfect blend of anise and licorice. Secret ingredient closes marathon of flavors.”

I really did not think of licorice at all when I tried it, just anise. The difference is slight but significant, anise just tastes like the spice while licorice flavors are almost all dark and molassey, and the best ones also have this herbal quality to them that anise flavors don't. There's no molasses here.

Seems like some things got lost in translation. I'll give away the “secret ingredient” - it's a very light touch of menthol. I get mostly a strawberry-forward mixed berry lemonade. I don't know why it says lime in the description, but it tastes like lemonade. WIth anise all up in it. To me it tastes like they messed up a very good menthol berry lemonade by adding anise to it, but if you're into this sort of thing, maybe you'd love it. The menthol is very subtle, but it's enough that someone might think they ruined a good anise-spiced berry lemonade by adding menthol to it.

I get the menthol first. Then it starts with the anise that remains throughout the vape, layered across the top of a smooth, crisp lemon followed by a sweet, clean mixed berry finish. Don't need it. **TRASH 20**

**Soft Baked Cookie Base**

Generic bakery. Not as soft-baked as I'd expect from something with soft-baked in the name, it's got some crunch to it, that little bit of nuttiness you get not from a nut but from something being baked until it's browned a bit. Not over done, though, more of a happy medium between the truly soft-baked cookies and the well-done crunchy type cookies. Bit softer in the bakery body but those top notes are crisp. This also reads more of a generic baked something to me than a dead-on authentic cookie. You could call it whatever you want, basically. Cookie, biscuit, biscotti, shortbread, pie crust, anything in that family of baked goods that's typically more dense, crunchy, and dry than cake. Still, nothing weird or off about it.

I have a couple of recipes already lined up that use it, here's two more:

[Corn Bread Cookie](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/213420-corn_bread_cookie). Because that looks amazing. **TASK 23**

[Cookie-Crack-Caine](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/217240-crackcookiecaine). Really does look like a recipe for soft buttery vanilla cookies, not so much because of the MB Soft-Baked Cookie Base but because of ingredients like FLV Vanilla Pudding and VT Butter Toffee Base. I'll sub JF Cookie for the FA Cookie that I've already tossed and even if this isn't the best cookie recipe ever, I know it's gonna be good. **TASK 24**

**Soft Banana**

Very much on the realistic, natural side as far as banana flavors go, with just a hint of candy/artificial. Thick and fairly sweet with a somewhat understated flavor. Not very creamy, but creamy enough for a medium-ripe banana without any added cream. Seems like it might get buried in a mix but be a good base for another banana that needs more body.

I wasn't able to narrow down the MB Soft Banana recipes I want to try below half a dozen, so here we go:

[banana cream crepe](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/97156-banana_cream_crepe). It all looks so good, especially the TFA Banana Nut Bread and little touches of FA Custard Premium and VT Golden Syrup. **TASK 25**

[Caramel Banana Cream Pie](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/166210-caramel_banana_cream_pie__developed). Again it all looks great, but I'm mostly here for the FLV Vanilla Pudding + TFA Whipped Cream + VT English Toffee. **TASK 26**

[Nana's Loaf](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/314401-nanas_loaf). I think too often when the creator says the recipe is self-explanatory, it's just being lazy and not wanting to provide even halfway decent notes, but this one really is pretty self-explanatory. It just looks like an excellent banana nut bread. **TASK 27**

[Honey Banana Cookie](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/183391-honey_banana_cookie). Only by mixing and trying it can I tell how well the execution was done, but I love the profile. **TASK 28**

[Banamonade](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/217223-banamonade). Banana lemonade? That's too interesting to pass over. **TASK 29**

[Crazy Monkey Remix](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/237361-crazy_monkey_remix). All these ingredients are great, but I mostly want to see how VT Red Dates and banana go together. **TASK 30**

**Sweet Strawberry**

It tastes like strawberry candy mixed with a little natural but not entirely fresh strawberry. Really tastes like a mix of the old TFA Strawberry Ripe and CAP Sweet Strawberry, but more potent, with a higher Ripe to Sweet ratio than the 2:1 that was pretty normal back in the day, with that high jammy maltol flavor and a lot of jammy body but also a little washed out, like the natural strawberry that's there is like an out of season strawberry or a heat lamp strawberry instead of a strawberry grown out in the sun. It's brightened by just enough candy strawberry to be tasty, but it's like putting artificially-flavored strawberry jelly on fairly crappy strawberries. I've got too many strawberry flavors to hang on to this mediocre one. **TRASH 21**

**The Most Sweet Cream**

That is a bold claim “the most sweet” but it is indeed pretty darn sweet, I think SSA Sweet Cream might actually be sweeter a bit sweeter, but it's about tied. Besides having a sugary sweet top end, it's a little dry and not especially smooth for a cream flavor but otherwise really tastes like cream. It's not pukey to me but there is definitely a dairy twang to it. Very light hints of butter and brighter vanilla. It's pretty good and I certainly wouldn't hesitate to mix a recipe that uses it, but I'm deducting a point or two for being a bit on the dry side and not having a real creamy feel to it. Too many other, better creams to bother with this one any longer. **TRASH 22**

**Thick Vanilla Ice Cream**

It's thick and vanilla, and there's a nice sweetness to it, but also a slight hint of fake movie theater butter. Middle of the road vanilla in terms of how it tastes and how strong it is. Although it is thick, it's a little fluffy and slightly dry, like a marshmallow, but has a dairy cream flavor that keeps it from tasting more like a marshmallow than an ice cream. So like a fluffy, cheap ice cream, which could be just what you want, depending on the context. That hint of fake butter is super annoying to me, though, and it's weird to have a buttery taste without so much buttery richness.

Since the buttery taste in MB Thick Vanilla Ice Cream is light enough and not too intrusively fake tasting, I think it would be really good in a small amount for thickening a caramel or butterscotch layer, or would work better in an ice cream recipe that uses one of those things, where a little butter wouldn't hurt. But I'll be fine without it. **TRASH 23**

**Tropical Mango**

Definitely not bad, but it doesn't seem to be anything super special to me. It's startlingly lemony for a second at first, then riper and sweeter mango notes building to the finish and lingering in the aftertaste. Plenty of fleshy body and very little of that piney flavor so if a lot of mango flavors that others like seem too green or piney to you, this might be a good one for you. I have a rule about mediocre mangoes, though. I've got too many of them and they're all going in the **TRASH 24**

**USA Mix**

A very light, slightly toasty and maybe a little nutty tobacco with a fairly overbearing light brown sugar sweetness. When I say light brown sugar in this case, I don't mean it is a light amount of it, I mean like it doesn't have that molassey depth of dark brown sugar, you might even call it a mix of light brown and white sugars. It's super sweet and just barely brown. It is a kind-of cigarette-y tobacco, mostly toasty, with a slight nutty undertone that I noticed more and more of over time, but not at all a cigarette flavor overall. It really tastes like a component to an RY4-type of mix that's missing vanilla, except I'm concerned that adding vanilla might overwhelm the mild tobacco. Some of that INW Vanilla For Pipe might be interesting to mix with it.

There are no public recipes using this flavor but I might make the first.

**White Chocolate**

Haven't tried this, but I'm excited to, since I'd love a better white chocolate flavor than ones I'm used to. Will try a 1% sample. **TASK 32**

**Winnie**

Bold, deep honey flavor, with just very, very slight cat pee that's more in the room note than in the vape itself. The honey is lightly floral like a wildflower honey but not at all perfumy. But it's not only honey. It tastes like honey thoroughly mixed with milk or dairy cream, even has that rich, very creamy feel rather than a sticky, syrupy honey feel. Also getting a slight apricot-y stone fruit type of note from it. So, kind of a mess of stuff going on here, but most of it's good stuff, and I could definitely see it working very well in something like peaches & cream with honey, as long as you live alone and aren't subjecting anyone to that room note.

I have one recipe lined up that uses it. I've also wanted to see if one of my all time favorite recipes, [Notorious](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/37519-notorious), could possibly be even better with 0.5% MB Winnie in place of the 0.25% FA Honey. **TASK 33**

**Yellow Cake**

This is another one I haven't opened yet. I'll try a sample at 2%. **TASK34**

I also want to mix this [Bruised Lemon](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/196287-bruised_lemon) recipe for blueberry, blackberry, and lemon cake. **TASK 35**
