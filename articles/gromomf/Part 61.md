TASK OR TRASH - Each flavor gets assigned at least one task or it goes in the trash.

#Liquid Barn

**Baked Cinnamon Roll**

It tastes like toasted Pepperidge Farm Cinnamon Raisin bread rather than a cinnamon roll. I like that stuff, so this is not a problem for me. But it’s not a cinnamon roll. Very toasty and somewhat dry bready flavor, that is in the top notes, with light cinnamon spice, but not any real gooey doughy cinnamon cinnamon roll base. Light cinnamon, more like the cinnamon swirl in that bread than the richer, stronger cinnamon in a cinnamon roll. And some pretty accurate raisin notes. It’s sweet, but no sweeter than that bread. There’s some richness in the base but kind of a bland flavor there, it’s mostly top notes.

Nothing I want to mix uses it. **TRASH 1**

**Bakers Touch**

This is a poorly named flavor. It’s named like some kind of bakery additive, when in reality it’s more or less a one-shot recipe. And a pretty tasty one at that, in my opinion. Liquid Barn calls it a cinnamon streusel coffee cake a la mode. I don’t get the separation you’d need to really call it anything a la mode, but it does pretty much taste like ice cream mixed with a soft, moist cinnamon cake. Not really getting streusel, that sounds like marketing embellishment. The bakery cinnamon is up front and pretty forward here and builts as you vape it, like cinnamon does. It’s also a sweeter cinnamon, not like candy, but like it’s mixed with brown sugar. Underneath I’m getting plenty of very rich vanilla cream, but again, blended up with the cake, not separated from it. Although it’s a tasty single flavor, I’m not sure what to do with it, because it’s quite busy. I guess just accent the cake or cream as desired, or use it at a lower percentage to fill out something cinnamony like a cinnamon roll. It might be all the ice cream and cinnamon you need for a mexican fried ice cream, if you can add some crunchy bakery crust and the cake doesn’t get in the way.

I’ve already planned to mix one recipe that uses it. Didn’t see any others that were super-irresistible, but I’ll give [Shoofly Pie](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/92922-shoofly_pie__an_american_classic_) a shot because I love the actual pie. **TASK 1**

**Banana**

Laffy Taffy mostly, but with some realistic banana that is a bit under-ripe and a little green. Also quite a bit thin.

Not super gross, but I have no need for it. **TRASH 2**

**Belgian Waffle**

It’s been awhile, but as best I can recall this is more like a toaster waffle than a Belgian Waffle. But not a bad Eggo-type waffle, except it needs a fairly high concentration to really deliver the flavor, and at a concentration that really delivers the flavor, I know I’m not the only one who finds it pretty harsh. But it’s not a bad ingredient in smaller amounts, just needs some help to fill it out.

One of my all time-favorite recipes uses this, [Brown Sugar Sesame Waffle](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/211037-brown_sugar_sesame_waffle).

I’m obsessed with this profile so I’m excited to try [U-Hauling Honey Bunny](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/152881-uhauling_honey_bunny_sweet_honey_glazed_doughnut_bun). **TASK 2** along with the couple of others already in the to-do queue.

**Blue Raspberry**

After trying a bunch of blue raspberry flavors, this one seemed higher above average than it did before. Pretty weak concentration-wise, but on par for most LB. Fairly boldly flavored at 7%, not as much as I’d like, but not as soft as many of the other Blue Razz flavors. 9% (as recommended by LB) tastes like blue raspberry candy with some blades of fresh cut grass stuck to it. Just a couple of blades. Like the way green apple can get a little grassy. 7% is still more flavorful than many, and I have to actually search for that bit of gassiness, it’s not in my face. It’s sweet and a little flat, not a lot of nuance here, as expected for a candy flavor. Doesn’t taste 100% exactly like any blue razz candy I’ve ever ingested but is clearly a blue candy raspberry flavor, as it should be.

Making a concerted effort to see if I can find a new favorite blue raspberry recipe means already having half a dozen recipes that use LB Blue Raspberry on my to-mix list. But wait, there’s more:

[Keep it 100 - Blue Slush Remix](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/121491-keep_it_100__blue_slush_remix). As long as the TFA Raspberry Sweet doesn’t make it too ketchupy, this simple recipe should be, at the least, pretty solid. **TASK 3**

[Blue Razzberry!](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/202425-blue_razzberry) Uses OSDIY Blue Raspberry Slush as the lead actor, with LB Blue Razz supporting. I think that’s probably a good choice, as is INW Raspberry for oomph. **TASK 4**

[Blue Squalor](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/258069-blue_squalor) The notes are mostly a story about a heavyset singer’s overheated testicles and they end with describing the recipe as “fucking awful shit,” but I’m not buying it. I know those ingredients and as long as 1.2% FLV Sour Apple isn’t so much that it gets overly weird (I don’t think it will) that looks like a great recipe. **TASK 5**

[Sweet Blueberry Soda](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/175086-sweet_blueberry_soda/) is probably the tastiest looking recipe to incorporate LB Blue Raspberry that I’ve seen but it barely incorporates it at all, just 1% of this very weak flavor to blue things up a hair. **TASK 6**

**Blueberry Parfait**

I’ve never tried this but the fact that it’s not even available anymore makes me think it’s ok to go ahead and toss it. **TRASH 3**

**Cappuccino**

Tastes like mocha, not cappuccino. It’s chocolately, and the chocolate is a little tootsie rollish, not full on tootsie roll, but just a little off in that direction. It’s also not coffee-forward enough to be a cappuccino. More like a mocha latte with extra cream. No other off notes besides the fakey chocolate. It’s very sweet and creamy, but not especially rich. Don’t care for that tootsie roll business. **TRASH 4**

**Cherry Blossom Tea**

Liquid Barn suggested 6%, but 6% has enough of that plastic cherry nightmare stuff to ruin it for me as a single flavor. 4 to 5% is better. It’s a pleasant floral with maybe a little tea in there, like a white tea, and some soft cherry, like a tea with cherry blossoms and just a few bits of dried sweet red cherry. Still has just a light hint of “bottom-shelf rum eating away at a vinyl container,” but it’s so light that I’m sure it could easily be covered up in a mix.

I was ready to toss it until I saw this: [Simple Springtime Elegance](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/91444-mbs_simple_springtime_elegance_diydownundermarchchallenge_). **TASK 7**

**Chocolate Roll**

Unapologetically tootsie roll, with a weird vodka-like off note. **TRASH 5**

**Coconut Milk**

Sweet, creamy, slightly suntanny coconut with an odd spice note in the finish. It is very thick and smooth, with a great mouthfeel. Not really buttery, just intensely thick and creamy. The somewhat artificial coconut could probably be pulled in a more natural direction with the addition of a more natural coconut, but that warm spice note is bizarro. It’s like something halfway between cinnamon and nutmeg. Could maybe work as a good start to something like a Coquito (Puerto Rican eggnog). Not sure what else to do with it. Don’t want to mix any of the current recipes that use it. **TRASH 6**

**Cola Freeze**

The name appears to imply cooling but there isn’t any. Maybe it’s supposed to imply that it’s like a slushy, so you’re not looking for fizz, which makes more sense.And it’s very sweet and thick feeling, though the flavor itself is fairly light, and there’s a touch of florality to it though that seems to be coverable. Definitely needs to be mixed with a stronger cola top note and would be nice if it finished with more flavor, though it seems like it could work to fill out the middle of a cola duo or trio or have some role in a recipe. It’s not bad, but I don’t have any need for it. **TRASH 7**

**Cranberry Cobbler**

It’s mostly this thick bread-like crust, there’s a ton of crust and not much fruit. It’s a bit doughy but has some crunch to it, which seems about right for a cobbler, but there’s so much of it, the balance is weird. It comes off more like a muffin that was cooked at too high a temp for not long enough, so the outside’s a little crunchy but the inside’s undercooked and gooey. There’s just a little slightly floral cranberry in there. When I tried it at 12% as recommended by LB, it was a little green-tasting as well, but I didn’t notice any green leafy type flavor when I tried it again at 10%. The flavor itself is sweet overall but the sweetness resides more with the bread and in a sort of blankly sweet finish after the flavor dies off. I would not use this as a single flavor but I might try to build a better cobbler out of it by using it lower mostly for the bready crust and adding more cranberry or covering up the cranberry with another fruit.

I found two delicious-looking recipes that use this:

[mlNikon Berry Cobbler Custard](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/173989-mlnikon_berry_cobbler_custard). Just four ingredients, Cranberry Cobbler plus CAP Sweet Currant, CC Devon Cream, and FW Wild Berry Cobbler. **TASK 8**

And this fancy [Christmas Cranberry Bar](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/178207-christmas_cranberry_bar__based_on_starbucks_cranberry_bliss_bar_) that also uses CAP Sweet Currant. **TASK 9**

**Cream**

It’s like whipped cream flavor-wise, it’s creamy and just a touch buttery, without any strong dairy or vanilla. The top end of the flavor is super thin, almost non-existent, and the middle is kinda thin too, but the bottom is there and that can work really well in like a fruit and cream where you might want some separation for layering. Not especially fluffy or super rich, reminds me of a watered down FA Cream Whipped.

Not a bad flavor, just nothing I want to try that uses it. **TRASH 8**

**Creme Brulee**

It’s dry caramel candy-infused custard. This is really more of a caramel than a creme brulee. But it is also loaded with heavily eggy custard with a light vanilla. It’s more of a caramel custard than a creme brulee, like flan but less sticky. It’s really not doing that crunchy torched sugar thing at all. It’s a dry, sugary caramel candy mixed with heavy custard. Also I found this a little harsh. Not terrible, but just a little throat scratchy. Gonna let this one go for lack of a recipe that I just gotta try, but it’s another that’s not bad. **TRASH 9**

**Dew Mountain**

Entirely flat, no fizz, and a little chemically-tasting, but you can tell it’s supposed to taste like Mountain Dew. Kinda waxy and muted beyond the initial tart punch of lemon-lime, missing more of that orange base of Mountain Dew and not very sweet, either. Weird, lingering metallic off note that would be forgivable if it also gave an effervescent impression, but it doesn’t. It’s probably fixable, or useable to make make one of those Mountain Dew varieties like Livewire or Pitch Black, maybe Baja Blast, or god help you if you want to dive into cherries and turn it into Code Red. Anyway, it might provide the basic Dew-ness for one of those, but you’d have to add the right fruit flavors as well as make it fizzy and sweeter.

I’ll give this simple [Ginger Ale](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/213861-ginger_ale) a try, it seems like the additions of CAP Super Sweet, FLV Ginger, and especially VT Fizzy Sherb will do good things to Dew Mountain. **TASK 10**

**Eggnog**

It’s pretty clearly supposed to be Eggnog, but it’s light on the nutmeg flavor, a little thin, and oddly sour. Not like a lemon or stomach acid sour, but like a sour cream or “maybe I don’t want to pour this on my cereal but maybe it will be OK” milk sour. The sell or use by date says ok but my nose says probably not, that kind of milk. Iffy milk. Smooth, creamy, just a bit thin for eggnog. I’ll pass. **TRASH 10**

**Fresh Cream**

The PINK STUFF. It’s mostly just a plain neutral cream that might work fairly well as a base. It feels a little thin and dry up front, even to the point of being a bit harsh, and it has a little bit of a coconutty off note, as well, but it’s considerably thicker and smoother in the end. It has a rich buttery finish for something so thin on top but that it’s more like coconut oil than butter with that coconut off note. **TRASH 11**

**Giant Swan**

I fucking love [Giant Swan](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/247312-giant_swan). If I’m ever able to whittle this down to just 10 flavors, it might be the 10 I need to make more Giant Swan. But, this old bottle (might not even be good anymore, as in some of the lightest aroma molecules might have floated off) doesn’t even have enough left to mix another 50ml. It’s a waste of shelf space. **TRASH 12**

**Greek Yogurt**

It’s a medium thick (more like whipped cream than ice cream) and very chalky dairy base with some pukey sourness, but there’s also some acidity to it that’s more like a citrus than a stomach acid. Not enough to be an identifiable citrus like the lemon in VT Yogurt Drink, but maybe leaning a little lemony. It gives it a cleaner finish despite that slightly vomity bit in there. The spoiled milk thing is nowhere near as intense as in a lot of the other yogurt flavors. It’s also fairly sweet compared to most of the yogurts.

I wouldn’t rule out a recipe that uses a small amount of it, but there isn’t one I want to mix. **TRASH 13**

**Green Apple**

Potent for a Liquid Barn flavor, full-flavored at 3%, usually LB is a little weaker. Mostly green apple candy, but also has sort-of spicy peel note and some other weird shit going on. Not only nail polish remover but also as a weird, waxy, plasticky thing going on. Thick body but it feels a little creamy and there might even be a bit of vanilla in there. Overall result is less like a green apple jolly rancher and more like a green apple laffy taffy, but wrapper and all, along with some spicyish apple peel. **TRASH 14**

**Green Delight**

I don’t remember what this tastes like but since it no longer exists I imagine I’ll be fine without it. **TRASH 15**

**Honeydew**

Really bright almost acidic aggressively candied honeydew flavor. I’ve never had honeydew candy, but this is what I imagine it would taste like, the top note of this. Underneath, a cream base that doesn’t just taste like a creamy-ish ripe melon, it tastes like an actual cream flavor, like mixing a cream with a bright artificial honeydew flavor. The overall effect is odd and I’m not sure what to do with it. **TRASH 16**

**Kings Custard**

It’s a recipe (available on DIYorDIE) & a one-shot. This needs a longer steep. There’s a slight sharpness, like raw brown sugar, that I’m certain will steep out, while the custard just gets thicker, richer, smoother, and sweeter. But it was already pretty tasty at 2 weeks. Not mind blowing or anything like that, but pretty tasty. It mostly tastes like a flan with a caramel sauce, but also has a distinctly butterscotch finish. Slightly eggy vanilla custard with the French vanilla top note somewhat obscured by a bookending caramel, very sweet, with light butter and extra dairy compared to most custards, even a bit of that dairy tang to it. There’s a lot of depth here. I’m sure you could add like one thing to it if you wanted, but it seems awfully busy to use as an ingredient. It didn’t appear to leave any gunk on my coils, but vaping about 5 ml of it at 12% did leave my wick looking quite a bit more crispy than 5 mil usually does.

I don’t want to mix it again or use it as an ingredient so even though it’s pretty tasty, **TRASH 17**

**Lava Cake**

Some time around 2018 or 2019, this was reformulated. The old version is irrelevant but it was better. Of course it was better.

The new version tastes more like light, fluffy chocolate cake, not especially heavy or rich, more like a chocolate Angel Food Cake than a Devil's Food Cake. Not as chocolatey as a real chocolate cake either, like an under-chocolated chocolate angel food cake. In terms of off-notes, not bad whatsoever for a chocolatey flavor. I thought it seemed maybe a little perfumey on the first hit or two, but after that, no. Just under-chocolated fluffy chocolate cake that’s also a little undercooked. It has a little bit of a raw flour taste to it, like cake batter has, and the tiniest bit of a raw cocoa flavor as well. Enough of both that if you found the right chocolate to add it to make it chocolately enough, you could easily make a chocolate cake batter vape out of it without any of the cake batter flavors.

I would otherwise probably be fine without it, but I need it for one of my all-time favorite recipes, [Mjuk Pepparkaka](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/206522-mjuk_pepparkaka), where a small amount of it works perfectly to darken CAP Gingerbread. **TASK 11**

If I’m going to keep it around for that, might as well look into what else can be done with it.

[Sensory s’mores](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/238811-sensory_s%E2%80%99mores_) looks like a pretty solid from-scratch s’more. **TASK 12**

[Sturdy Iron Key](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/268305-sturdy_iron_key) looks like a delicious classic German chocolate cake. **TASK 13**

[Night Before Christmas](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/301299-night_before_christmas) is a recipe for chocolate cake with cranberries. I’ll sub FW Sweetener for the PUR Super Sweet that I don’t have. **TASK 14**

**Melon Head**

I know a lot of people really enjoy this one, but it is definitely not for me. It grew on me a little after vaping it for a bit but my immediate impression of Melon Head was “cantaloupe rinds doused with pine sol.” I get under ripe cantaloupe top notes mixed with something piney like green mango peel, with a little bit of a funky, musky tropically gummy candy chewy body. There’s some citrus in there as well and if you ignore what it actually tastes like and just focus on that, there seems to be a really well-crafted balance of sweet and tart. The funky musk in the body is actually not unwelcome in a tropical vape, it kind of gives it some authenticity. But the vape is very top heavy and the top notes are not good for me, all rind and peel. I guess that is supposed to taste natural but instead it just tastes like poor fruit preparation. Fruits should be ripened and peeled properly and fully, not served under ripe with bits of peel hanging off them. **TRASH 18**

**Menthol**

It’s just menthol, nothing special. I don’t need it. **TRASH 19**

**Moon Sugar**

One-shot given to me that I never got around to opening. Will try it at 10% **TASK 15**

**Muffin Man**

I did not get muffin from it, it’s mostly a very sweet cinnamon apple, with some cinnamon roll flavor underneath. The cinnamon is nicely done, plenty present without going overboard, and the apple is super strong, bright, and vibrant without any off notes. It’s pretty smooth, for a cinnamon vape, has a nice full mouthfeel though not really much of a bakery texture. Sweet without being stupid sweet. This wasn’t a bad vape, but it wasn’t stellar, either, it’s a one-shot that I can live without. **TRASH 20**

**Orange Banana**

Half candy/half natural not-half-bad banana plus really solid orange juice flavor, but a ridiculously harsh vape until it steeps for like a month. If you’re that patient, the result is like a delicious fruit smoothie that’s just banana and orange, with the banana running a little artificial/candy but nowhere near full-on Runts. If you’re shooting for a Dole Pineapple-Orange-Banana vape, this will do it, just find the right pineapple or pineapples, and then wait very patiently for the harshness to steep out. I also think you could swap pineapple for some other fruit and get an excellent result. But, I don’t want to wait that long for it to not tear my throat up. **TRASH 21**
