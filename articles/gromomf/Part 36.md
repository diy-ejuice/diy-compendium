## FLAVORAH

**Sangria**

I don't think it does that great a job of tasting like what I think of Sangria, but I have to put a huge disclaimer on that, because what is Sangria anyway? It's wine with fruit in it, but it could be made from all kinds of wine and all kinds of fruit and in all different combinations. With or without brandy added to it. So maybe it tastes just like someone's favorite sangria, I don't know. I get a thick, medium-sweet base of mostly red grape, along with some dark berry, with top and mid-range stone fruit type notes, like peach or apricot, and some cranberry-like tartness. None of the citrus notes I'm usually looking for with sangria, none of the really booziness of wine with a shot of liquor, either. It's basically just a kind of grape-based fruit punch. But, it's pretty freakin tasty, regardless.

I need it to have [Flawed Vacations in Spain](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/137141#flawed_vacations_in_spain_fizzy_sangria_by_motherpunker) again - It's a flawless recipe as far as I can tell. **TASK 1**

Also want to try this simple, tasty-looking little recipe for an [Oranged Drink](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/285589#oranged_drink_by_mullas). **TASK 2**

**Smoked Butterscotch**

This tops out for me at 2% (sub-ohm), and even there that smoked note is starting to get very slightly bitter and weird. But between 1 and 2% this is some tasty stuff. The smoke flavor tastes like wood smoke not like ashy smoke. The butterscotch tastes like FLV Butterscotch, but not as rich and buttery. It's a little on the dry side, but much more interesting than regular butterscotch. It would probably be my first choice if I was going to build a butterscotch-tobacco recipe.

I've already got a few recipes to try that use it, just adding one more, which I'm very excited to finally try: [Phil Noir](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/122651#phil_noir_by_lonesomerhodestn). Butterscotch custard with smokey tobacco notes that looks incredible. **TASK 3**

**Smooth Vanilla**

The FLV Rich Cinnamon of bright as fuck vanilla. About 16 times more potent than the average vanilla.. Bright and floral enough to remind you that vanilla comes from a flower. A little bit fruity, in a cherry-ish sort of way. Also kind of a honey-like sweetness to it (not a bad one) that comes and goes. I think many people will want to make a dilution; 0.25% standalone is intense.

When it comes to creating recipes, I don't really need a vanilla that can ruin a mix with an extra half-drop. But, people have made great things out of it, and I need that 0.1% to make more [Arab Mom's Butter Cookie](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/197505#arab_mom_s_butter_cookie_by_nowar). That one's so good it goes back on the list, even though I just added it in 10 editions ago. **TASK 4** It's in a couple of other things I'm going to try, too, but I don't see any more I want to add. It could be that Arab Mom is the only thing I end up keeping for.

**Smoothie Base**

Goodness, that's pretty tasty. Unfortunately it's also very lemony. Kind of like VT Yogurt Drink, it's basically a tasty lemon cream or lemon milk. Not sure why they went with lemon for a smoothie, when banana would have been more appropriate for a smoothie I think, since banana goes in lots of smoothies and lemon doesn't, but it's yummy. If you were making a fruit cereal milk recipe it would be perfect for that. Also seems like the lemon could get covered up with another strong fruit and just make that fruit pop.

FLV Smoothie Base really has that heavy creamy base. There's some real dairy there. Not necessary yogurt but a heavy dairy, without the butyric yuck that some of those flavors have.

I've tried some very good recipes that used FLV Smoothie Base, like a handful of five-stars, but the one that was “gotta mix again” status for me is this amazing [Mega Fruit Smoothie](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/144316#mega_fruit_smoothie_developed_by_developed), even though I think it's kinda redundant to have both Smoothie Base and Yogurt Drink in the same recipe. **TASK 5**

Want to try this one, too:

[Fairy Dust - Blue Raz Slushie](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/269447#fairy_dust_blue_raz_slushie_mwc_best_recipe_by_diyejuices). **TASK 6**

**Smore**

Not a full S'more. I get some chocolate that's not too bad, some marshmallow that maybe tastes lightly toasty, but not really, and no graham cracker anywhere, other than in the mouthfeel, where it's a little dry and gritty. The marshmallow is sweet and fluffy. The chocolate's a little dark, like a really light dark chocolate, and gets darker in the finish. Seems like a good addition to something like a hot chocolate recipe, with the addition of some dairy and a much lighter chocolate.

Already planning on mixing a simple recipe with FW S'mores to see if they'll combine into a full s'more, since they are deficient in opposite ways. There isn't really anything else I want to do with it, so assuming that first mix wasn't perfect (it won't be), I'll try an updated version of that. **TASK 7**

**Sour Apple**

Pretty polarizing flavor, with a not-insignificant number of folks reporting intolerable off-notes from it. I find it to be legit sour, very rare among the so-called sour flavors and additives. It has a real sour, sour green apple top note. More sour than green apple, really, like the green apple needs help but not the sour. It's also very thick and full-bodied, but someone kinda ruined this for me by pointing out the coconut off note in it. Sure enough, that base tastes pretty coconutty when I think about it, at least when it's pushed up to 1.5%. Lucky for me I don't hate coconut, but if you do, you might wanna skip it.

I need it for [Lic Her..Ish](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/69073#lic_her_ish_by_digitaldrops), a red licorice recipe that tastes spot-on. **TASK 8**

And [Camp Tigerclaw](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/127046#camp_tigerclaw_by_concreteriver). **TASK 9**

I also want to try [Chartreuse](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/201995#chartreuse_by_staybert), which looks, and by all accounts, IS, a delightful fruit medley. **TASK 10**

And [alley couches](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/259827#alley_couches_by_chumbles), which is an apple and coconut recipe that also looks great to me. Take that, coconut off-note! **TASK 11**

**Soursop**

Speaking of apple and coconut...

Tart and acidic top notes taste more like green apple than the pineapple-type top notes of some of the competing flavors but it's not a spot-on sour green apple. It's simultaneously softer than a green apple and yet more acidic, like green apple with a touch of pineapple, more of a pineapple acidity. There's also a bit of earthy muskiness that comes in more right after that initial sharper bite. Base is coconut cream-like, moderately thick, natural-tasting sweetness, and smooth, with just the slightest hint of banana and something cherry-ish without the cherry medicine garbage. Interestingly smooth finish for something so tart initially. But yeah, mostly green apple and coconut notes. I would have fit in well in that alley couches recipe.

Yet to try a FLV Soursoup recipe I gotta mix again, but I'm excited about a couple already on the mix list and very happy to add one more, [Sour Star Bangler](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/228938#sour_star_banagler_by_danielthevapeman), a “tropical overload of tropical stuff” by Daniel. **TASK 12**

**Spearmint**

Sweet spearmint cream? Tastes like sweet spearmint gum but it's thick and soft with a creamy mouthfeel. I can't tell if there's some vanilla in there or if creaminess just feels so much like a vanilla cream or vanilla marshmallow that I'm filling in the blanks mentally with vanilla. It's very separate though, it's just a bit odd to have such a full, thick mouthfeel with spearmint. The spearmint itself is smooth and somewhat subdued.

Not my favorite spearmint (SSA Garden Mint FTW), and nothing out there I want to mix that uses it? **TRASH 1**

**Starch Base**

Rin called this “unsalted white oyster crackers” on ELR and that's as good a review as any. It reminds me of the communion crackers at church when I was a kid. Lightly, toasty, unsalted, unleavened bread. IT TASTES LIKE THE BODY OF CHRIST, YALL.

Very thick, full volume, not sweet, not yeasty. I get slight notes of brown rice-like nuttiness that tastes like it could go sesame oil-like at a higher concentration, or otherwise get weird. A little dry, a little crisp. Lives up to its name. Does seem like a little of this could do for the body of bread in a mix, like a sandwich. It certainly worked in Foment's Gruber Grape recipe.

I am of the mind that everyone should have this so they can at least try Gruber Grape, because of how hard people tried to create that recipe for years. Turns out PB and strawberry jam, not so hard, but PB and grape jelly? Herculean. On the other hand, I don't feel like I need Gruber in my life, so now what do I do with Starch Base?

More PB sandwich vapes, apparently. I've already got a PB and marshmallow fluff on the agenda. Lemme just add a [PB and Raspberry Jam](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/219493#hans_hajime_by_spdrjrslm) sammy and a [PB and Strawberry Jam](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/284825#dad_is_late_for_work_pb_j_sandwich_mwc_breakfast_by_capiadiy) sammy while I'm at it. **TASK 13** and **TASK 14**

**Strawberry**

It's very different from other strawberries and not in a good way. It's a very jammy but deeply weird take on a natural strawberry. It has a very thick jammy body but it's kind of waxy as well. It makes me feel like I'm eating equal parts of the layer of wax sealant on top of some old-fashioned homemade strawberry jam and the jam itself. The strawberry jam itself tastes off, too, like old strawberry fruit leather, but without as much sweetness and intensity as fruit leather. I have too many other strawberries to keep this one. **TRASH 2**

**Strawberry Cream**

Strawberry forward with a very light creamy backdrop and finish, but the strawberry tastes weird and kinda yucky, like it's fermented. Like strawberry wine but less sweet. Although the cream is barely there, it tastes like it would be better without it, it's a gross juxtaposition against a fermented strawberry. **TRASH 3**

**Strawberry Filling**

A very sweet yet natural strawberry, like smooshy thawed out carton strawberries coated in sugar syrup, with a smooth, thick and oddly somewhat creamy mouthfeel. Full flavored and even lingers well beyond the vape. But, with just a little bit of a weird plasticky off note, which also lingers, that ruins it for me standalone, especially given that there are so many other strawberries that don't have that to deal with. Might be good at a low dose for sweetening and filling out another strawberry if that plastic nonsense is covered up, not entirely pleasant on its own though. On the upside, the more of it I vaped, the less noticeable that plastic became, so maybe it just needs a longer steep to let go of whatever that is. Better strawberries, don't need it. **TRASH 4**

**Strawberry Smash**

Sticky sweet but weak strawberry, like drinking watered down sweetened strawberry juice, with hints of greenish floral and almost mediciney off notes, and bit of cream-soda like cream. Sugar water with strawberries stems and all and maybe some strawberry blossoms as well floating in it, with a dollop of cream stirred in? I could see using it in a tea or something like that or with another strawberry for sweetness, fullness, and a more natural taste at the same time, but it's weird. **TRASH 5**

**Sugar Orchid**

Severely underused flavor, IMO. Could call it cherry-vanilla sugar if you want to really oversimplify it. Gently floral, vaguely fruity (cherry-ish but not cherry), almost vanilla, thick, quite sweet, a chalky/powdery/gritty sweetness.

I need it for [Galadriel's Light](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/213994#galadriel_s_light_by_yizarion), one of my most favorite recipes of all time. It's a weird profile - floral, bourbon, coconut - but just amazing and addictive. I've only ever vaped it without sweetener but the creator suggests adding FW's at 0.25% so I'm going to give that a try this time. **TASK 15**

Will someone with more talent and creativity than me please create another Sugar Orchid recipe for me to try?

**Sun Cookie**

If this were someone's recipe that they created and I tried it, I'd call it “interesting” and it would be about 50% a sincere interesting and 50% one of those Wayne Walker “interestings” where he really means “WTH is wrong with you” but is being polite. As a flavor though, it's getting closer to 100% Wayne Walker WTH type of “interesting.”

It's got an actual cookie base that does a better job of being a baked good than most of FLV's other bakeries as it actually has some nice, crispy body to it, but there's all sorts of weird stuff going on with it. There's some kind of green nut in here. I'm not sure, but it tastes like the cookie itself is green. Not artificially green, like a very natural, earthy green nut. Not a pistachio, more like sunflower seeds but greener. Extra super organic vegan sunflower seeds? IDK. The cookie base tastes like hippy food, basically. There's also a pile of tart and sweet natural lemon on top. Like a big pile. So it's a green nut cookie with handful of lemon zest all over it. And a touch of anise in there with the lemon to make it extra “interesting.” **TRASH 6**

**Sweet and Smokey Tobacco**

It's a robust tobacco that really is smokey without being ashy, like the tobacco has been smoked the way meat is smoked, along with a hint of peppery-ish spiciness, and a very sweet finish for a tobacco, like a honey caramel sweetness that smooths out as a nice counterbalance to that spicy smokeyness at first. The sweetness is there the whole time as kind of a base or undercurrent, but it feels like it ramps up because the smokeyness and especially the bit of tongue tickling spice dies off. It's a very full-bodied, complete flavor that's really complex for a single flavor. It also seems like just the thing to give an RY4 a little more tobacco oomph.

I need it for more [Prapple Bacco 2021](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/235253#prapple_bacco_2021_by_nowar) - A bright, crisp fall-friendly fruit that's a little tart, a sweet and nutty praline, and a spicy tobacco tying them together **TASK 16**

It's used in at least half a dozen recipes I already plan to try and will likely be in a few more I'll try to create.

Also: [Buttery Ho](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/214055#buttery_ho_by_mindfloodz). Butterscotch. Custard. Tobacco. **TASK 17**

[Early Autumn Pipe](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/166065#early_autumn_pipe_by_chemicalburnvictim). Caramel Apple Pie Tobacco. **TASK 18**

[Ruins](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/310881#ruins_by_doubleyoustew). Banana graham RY4 thing.. I dunno. Looks good. **TASK 19**

**Sweet Cigarette**

It's sweet, but not very sweet for something with “sweet” in the name. I get an ashy and dirty tobacco, dry and roasty, a little smokey like wood smoke, with hints of vanilla and maybe caramel. I've pushed it as high as 1.5% as a single flavor but I'd keep it much lower in a mix, I'm thinking primarily for mixing with non-dessert tobaccos that could stand to be just a little sweeter, which you also want to be ashier and smokier.

[IPA Smoke](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/98302#ipa_smoke_by_matthewkocanda) was a really neat recipe that I'm glad I tried, but don't feel like I need to have again. I do want to try this [Virginia 1877](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/173602#virginia_1877_by_vensyboy), though. The creator really seems to know what he's doing and it might help inform my own chocolate-tobacco adventures. **TASK 20**

There's also this [Bacco Blend No. 3](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/209685#bacco_blend_no_3_light_smoky_ashy_medium_mellow_sweet_blend_by_nowar), that I want to try as it's offered as a base for adding accents to, even though I'm a little concerned that the combo of Kentucky and Sweet Cig is going to produce a result that's too ashy for my taste. **TASK 21**

**Sweet Coconut**

Beautiful coconut flavor. I had to somehow live with just one coconut, FLV Sweet Coconut would probably be it. Clean, bright, natural coconut flavor, very sweet but tastes like a natural sort of sweetness rather than artificial sweetener. Not really rich, but not thin either. I think it's appropriately rich for coconut, but not overdoing it. Would need to be more rich for a coconut cream. It really reminds me of one of those Mexican coconut candies that are colored red white and green, and the ingredients are just like: :shredded coconut, sugar, corn syrup, coloring: and that's it. Don't recommend going over 2.5%, that's where the brightness of this one almost starts to go a little in a floral direction.

I need it for [Leche De Coco](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/42350#leche_de_coco_coconut_milk_by_hashslingingslashur). It's been a long time since I last had that, not sure it still belongs among the most favorites, but we'll see. **TASK 22**

I need it for a couple more old favorites that were recently added, a new favorite that was recently found, a really good recipe of my own, and a whole bunch of stuff I already plan to try. But wait, there's more:

[Thai Grandma Coconut Ice Cream](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/257431#thai_grandma_s_coconut_ice_cream_by_spdrjrslm). Damn, that looks good. **TASK 23**

[1-2-3 Tropico](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/121704#1_2_3_tropico_by_ediblemalfunction) you put de lime AND a banana in de coconut. **TASK 24**

**Sweet Cream**

It's not bad tasting (to me) and it might even be exactly what you're looking for, depending on what you're doing, but it's a little weird. It's definitely a sweet dairy cream, but the sweetness is different. Most of the other sweet cream flavors have sugar, brown sugar, or kinda cotton candyish sweetness, but Flavorah's Sweet Cream is oddly fruity. It specifically reminds me of peach or other stone fruit, not the fully fruit flavor, but just the sweetness from it. Might be a perfect cream for a peaches & cream. The dairy is a little tangy, just enough so it's very clearly a dairy cream. 1.5% has a creamy texture but 2% starts to get a little waxy. It's not especially rich, not real heavy cream. This is unfortunately NOT “FLV Cream, but sweeter.”

Of note, some people also report getting strong coconut off-notes from FLV Sweet Cream. But I don't. But if other flavors taste like coconut to you that shouldn't, like TFA Cheesecake Graham Crust, and you hate coconut, you might want to avoid it.

I've got at least 17 “sweet cream” flavors and many more cream flavors and I would definitely toss this one if it didn't already appear in a couple of recipes I'm planning to try for unrelated reasons. I didn't see another recipe that I wanted (besides those two) that I want to mix, but I did feel inspired by one, a recipe for a “sweet cream thai chai with lychee in it.” I could do without the chai spice and tea notes, but a cream on the lighter side (with the notes FLV Sweet Cream has) and some lychee could be nice.

Lychee Cream Saver V1 **TASK 25**

| Co. | Flavor        | %   |
| --- | ------------- | --- |
| FE  | Lychee        | 2   |
| FA  | White Peach   | 0.5 |
| FLV | Sweet Cream   | 1   |
| TFA | Vanilla Swirl | 1   |

Going for something like a Lifesaver's Strawberry Cream Saver, but lychee. I think this might work, plus it gives me an excuse to play with FE Lychee, a candy-type lychee that I love.

**Sweet Dough**

Potent flavor, 0.5% is a lot of it. Tastes like a slightly undercooked biscuit drenched in simple syrup. Thick, rich texture, doughy, very pleasant to vape, though a little odd. Does not have any yeasty, fried, or frosted (though it is very sweet) notes but it tastes like it would be a perfect component for the main body of a donut, just needs those parts added.

It's in a couple of things I plan to try and I need it for [Vanilla Cronut](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/115532#vanilla_cronut_by_mlnikon). Just amazing, after it steeps. **TASK 26**

**Sweet Fig**

There's not a huge lot of difference between FLV Fig and FLV Sweet Fig, to the extent that I think it's a little weird that they have both, but there are differences. The Sweet Fig is indeed sweeter, less musky, not as dark, and lacks that hint of spice. I think it tastes closer to real dried fig than FLV Fig and is probably what most mixers are looking for in a fig flavor.

Intensely sweet but dark and a little earthy, tastes very much like the bag of dried Mission figs you get at the grocery store. If you have no idea what that tastes like, imagine the hybrid of an apple and a raisin. Not far off from fig newton filling, though I'm not sure what it would take to get it the rest of the way there. Seems like a great sweetener for tobacco. I've seen people mention it having a woody note, I think they're just using it too high? I didn't push it high enough to find out, it's very potent and 0.75% is full flavored.

I'll give this [Port Royale](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/223346#port_royale_fig_stachio_custard_tobacco_by_fadedjay1) fig, pistachio, custard tobacco a try. **TASK 27**

**Sweet Mango**

This tastes like it was designed to put CAP Sweet Mango out of business and should be successful at that.

I've used a small amounts of CAP Sweet Mango to add fleshy depth to more top-heavy mangos often, but had to be careful not to add too much and make it yucky. FLV Sweet Mango tastes like it could do that very well without ever getting yucky. It's a bit basey and feels like it would do much better than others at getting down into something like a cream base rather than just sitting on top of it.

It's very sweet, but without being candyish. It's got quite a bit more funky ripe tropical depth than the original FLV Mango, without going over into cloying or rotten like some mango flavors do. What it doesn't do is really hit those bright citrusy high notes very well. It also isn't very juicy. I'm going to want to almost alway mix it with FLV's original mango, FA Indian Mango, VT Shisha Mango or maybe FLV Ripe Mango.

It's also lacking some of those piney terpy sort of peel-like top notes that you might sometimes want, so again, mixing with other mango flavors for a full spectrum in your face natural mango experience.

Of course I already have a bunch of plans for this, both recipes I will try to create and others' recipes I'm excited to try. What's a few more then, right?

[Mango Loko](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/278871#mangoloko_by_brunojara). Four (!) different mango flavors, sweetener, and WS-23. Why not? **TASK 28**

[Mango Slice](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/233211#mango_slice_by_davidn2kl). Three mangoes, some apple, VT Sugar Cane, and that delicious SSA Nectarines. **TASK 29**

[F yo mango sentinel](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/235817#f_unk_yo_mango_sentinel_by_chumbles) looks like a mango lemon-lime spritzer, with just a bit of cooling, and right up my alley. **TASK 30**

**Sweetness**

I've heard all kinds of theories about what's in there but as far as I can tell from tasting it as high as 2%, it's just sucralose. About 5 out of 10 on a sweetness scale with CAP Super Sweet as a 10 and FW Sweetener as a 7.5. I would not use it to develop a recipe, mostly because FW is cheaper and I have a gigantic bottle of that to use up, but it's in a bunch of recipes I'm already planning to try and a handful of favorites. When I run out of FLV Sweetness, I'll probably figure out how much FW Sweetener to use as a sub rather than replacing it (I'm thinking 0.25% FW for every 0.33% FLV), but in the meantime, I'll add one more recipe. Citrus+cream recipes can be easy to do ok but hard to do great, and this one looks like it might be great [IBIZA](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/283572#mwc_ibiza_by_bqrn). **TASK 31**

Blew right past the character limit, the second half of this will be up in a few minutes.

New Flavor Count: 2,548
