#CAPELLA Lemon Meringue Pie

Update. My first attempt to create a lemon fried pie using CAP LMP was disappointing. It’s insufficiently lemony, and the pie crust part is both too prominent and leaves an overcooked taste in my mouth. Less of a lemon fried pie and more like someone dropped a lemon cookie in a fryer and left it there too long. What I mixed was 2% WF Glazed Donut (for the fried aspect), 0.75% TFA Pie Crust, 5% CAP LMP, 1% FE Lemon. I’ll try again using the same ingredients in different proportions and see if I can get closer.

Lemon Fried Pie Attempt V2 **TASK 1**

| Co. | Flavor             | %   |
| --- | ------------------ | --- |
| CAP | Lemon Meringue Pie | 5.5 |
| FE  | Lemon              | 1.5 |
| WF  | Glazed Donut       | 2   |
| TFA | Pie Crust          | 0.5 |

First attempt at a Lemon Moon Pie was much better tasting but still disappointing. Insufficiently lemony, again. Just a grahammy cookie and marshmallow with a hit of lemon. Too much grahammy cookie, as well. And undersweet. This one could someday be great, but it’s going to need a bunch of work probably.

I mixed 5% CAP LMP, 2% CAP Sugar Cookie, 3% FW Graham Cracker, and 2% OoO Marshmallow (Vanilla). This time I’ll try:

Lemon Moon Pie Attempt V2 **TASK 2**

| Co. | Flavor                | %   |
| --- | --------------------- | --- |
| CAP | Lemon Meringue Pie    | 5   |
| FE  | Lemon                 | 1   |
| CAP | Sugar Cookie          | 1   |
| FW  | Graham Cracker        | 2   |
| OoO | Marshmallow (Vanilla) | 2   |
| FLV | Frosting              | 1   |
| FW  | Sweetener             | 0.5 |

Trying to boost the lemon with some FE Lemon, dialing back the bakery, adding sweetener, and adding a frosting to the outside that should also make it seem even sweeter overall.

#MEDICINE FLOWER

**Acacia Honey**

It’s possible that I’ve used too much even at 0.25%; it tastes like that might be the case. But at 0.25%, as low as I can go in a 10ml bottle without making a dilution, and even steeping for about 12 days, it’s ridiculously floral, to the point that it tastes like a honey-sweetened floral flavor rather than a honey flavor. But hey, no cat pee, right? None, not even a hint of it. But basically sniffing a drizzle of honey over a bouquet of flowers. You definitely get the honey taste and sweetness, but it’s so, so floral. As for the specific type of flower... I’m not sure. It’s not clearly rose, lavender, violet, jasmine, honeysuckle - though it’s definitely more like rose than any of the others. Maybe lilac. As it stands, I would not use it unless making a floral recipe, but I’ll try it again at 0.1%. **TASK 3**

**Almond**

Have not tried this. MF tends to be very potent so I’ll start with a 0.25% sample. **TASK 4**

**Apricot**

It’s not the boldest flavor at 0.5% (maybe it would be if pushed up to 0.75 or even 1%) but it really does taste like a fresh, natural apricot, which isn’t a super bold flavor anyway. It’s delightful. It makes me think of picking out fresh apricots and finding one that’s got just a little blush to it, it’s not entirely that uniform apricot color. And you know that one’s going to be extra sweet almost like it’s infused with honey, and a bit juicier than the others. A tish throaty for me, not to a degree that I’d hesitate to use it, but worth noting. It really has a full spectrum of flavor from the brighter almost-floral, almost-citrus top notes to the deeper syrupy base. I just wish it were turned up to 11 in intensity instead of 5 or 6, but again, inching up the concentration just a little bit might do it.

There are three public recipes on ATF that use it. All by the same mixer, none having any reviews. I can’t or don’t want to mix any of those, but it’s at 1.2% in one of them and 2% in the other two and that makes me think trying it again at 1% is probably a good idea. **TASK 5**

**Banana**

Have not tried. A couple of very old recipes have it at 1%, and a recipe designed for very low wattage MTL has it at 1.75%. I’ll start with a 0.5% sample. **TASK 6**

**Bergamot**

Have not tried, will start with a 0.25% sample. **TASK 7**

**Black Cherry**

Over the years, I’ve learned not to have high hopes for any cherry flavor, but here goes. 0.25% sample. **TASK 8**

**Black Currant**

0.25% sample, unless someone comes along who’s familiar with this one and has a better suggestion for where to start. **TASK 9**

**Black Tea**

Ditto. **TASK 10**

**Blackberry**

One old public recipe with no reviews uses it at 2%. I feel safe starting with 0.5% on this one. **TASK 11**

**Blueberry**

It’s really tasty and part of it’s a very realistic fresh blueberry, but there’s a bit of a kind of funk to it that doesn’t taste bad but is something I tend to associate more with blackcurrant than blueberry. Maybe there are blueberries that taste like this, I don’t know, but it really tastes more like a bold, realistic fresh blueberry-blackcurrant combo than a straight blueberry flavor. I do think a little of this could really make a more candied blueberry taste more realistic.

[Blue Crane](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/262026-blue_crane) is already on my to-mix list. Will also try this delicious-looking [Blueberry Cake Pops](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/blueberry_cake_pops) recipe. **TASK 12**

**Butterscotch**

Have not tried it, will mix a sample at 1% **TASK 13**

And while I’m at it, try this simple four-ingredient cookie recipe that uses it at 1%: [Kobra Kai](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/256384-kobra_kai/reviews) by DaveN2KL. **TASK 14**

**Cabernet Sauvignon**

I’ll try 0.25% to start. **TASK 15**

**Cantaloupe**

Ditto. **TASK 16**

**Caramel**

Have not tried it, but I see recipes using it at 0.75 to 2% so I think 1% might be a good starting point to try it out. **TASK 17**

[Rollin](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/23230-rollin_) is already on my list of things to try and as best I can tell, looks amazing. I’ll also try [Pardon Me, Mrs Rowely](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/pardon_memrs_rowley) that’s like a butterbeer pie by **TASK 18** and this three-ingredient RY4 [DEKANG4](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/dekang4) **TASK 19**

**Cinnamon**

Haven’t tried it and doubt it can hold a candle to FLV Rich Cin but will give it try at 0.75%. **TASK 20**

Might as well mix this three-ingredient, all-MF recipe while I’ve got it out: [Aphrodite's Sin](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/955-aphrodites_sin_by_open_source_vapor) by Open Source Vapor. **TASK 21**

**Coconut**

At 0.75%, it’s not coconut water, not coconut milk, but something in between. Like watered down coconut milk. Very natural coconut taste, but on the softer side, with a very light creaminess to it. Not very sweet.

I’m missing an ingredient from trying the only public recipe that uses it, and have enough other good coconut flavors that I feel fine letting this one go. **TRASH 1**

**Coffee**

Have not tried. Three recipes (which I can’t or don’t want to mix) have it at 1.5, 2, and 2.25%, so I’ll try a 1.5% sample. **TASK 22**

**Cucumber**

Potent, bold at 0.4%. Top note is on point tasting like a big slice of fresh cucumber. Some peel but not too much. Base is a little too sweet for cucumber, like I don’t think the flavor itself is sweet, but there’s nothing about it that really combats the inherent VG sweetness. It’s got some nice volume to it, too. It’s not dry but it’s not really super juicy either.

I’m definitely not going to be restocking this, so I might as well let it go. If you really, really need an authentic cucumber, and lots of it, it might be worth the price to you. But I think FA Cucumber will do well enough to meet any realistic cucumber needs I might have. **TRASH 2**

**Dark Chocolate**

This is possibly a perfect dark chocolate. The only thing I can complain about is, it seems a little soft. That might just be that 0.5% is a little too low, or that it needs to steep a little longer. Maybe if it had more time and/or concentration it would be completely perfect. There are no off-notes. It no-shit tastes like dark chocolate.

I used this to make an improved version of an old recipe. [Brookside Blues’ Brother](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/261779-brookside_blues_brother) is now ridiculously good, you should definitely try it. I’m excited to mix it again. **TASK 23**

When I tried this [Trillionaire Shortbread](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/234593-trillionaire_shortbread_redeveloped_noted_suggestion) recipe the first time, there was something wonderful about the chocolate and caramel portion, but INW Biscuit was a bit overwhelming at 1.5%. The mixer has since revised that down to 0.5% and I can’t wait to try it again. **TASK 24**

This [Honey Glazed Maple Fudge Bar](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/299404-honey_glazed_maple_cream_fudge_bar) looks interesting and potentially wonderful as well. I’ll sub CAP Super Sweet for the PUR Super Sweet that I don’t have. **TASK 25**

Finally, [Chocolate Prancer](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/chocolate_prancer). FLV Red Burley, MF Dark Chocolate, and TFA Bavarian Cream and Vanilla Swirl. Fuck yes, get in my facehole! **TASK 26**

**Dark Vanilla**

Have not tried it but am excited to, just based on the name. Will try a 1% sample. **TASK 27**

And this interesting [Unholy Vanilla](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/268386-unholy_vanilla_stone) meant to be a replacement for the defunct DIYFS Holy Vanilla. I’ll take the creators’ suggestion to add 1% FW Sweetener when using as a solo recipe rather than a well-rounded vanilla layer that’s part of something else. **TASK 28**

**Elderberry**

No clue. Will try 0.25%. **TASK 29**

**Fig**

Rides the line between fresh and dried fruit. Sweet, dark, and a little musky down low, but the top notes are brighter, fresher, and even a little juicy. Like a fig that hasn’t finished drying. The whole thing is very natural and flavorful, very deep. This seems to be a perfect fig for mixing with other natural fruit flavors. Might also work well with nuts and isn’t too bright and juicy to go in some kind of bakery or tobacco situation.

Will try this [Empress Fig](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/218003-empress_fig) fig cream recipe. **TASK 30**

**French Vanilla**

Little disappointed in this one at 0.75%. It’s not bad, and it is potent, but at MF prices I want it to be THE BEST. It does not appear to be THE BEST. It’s vanilla and it’s moderately thick and pretty smooth and I can’t really say what’s wrong with it, it’s darker and a little malty but that’s ok for a vanilla. The thing is it just doesn’t hit right, it might be best for a background vanilla, there’s a softness to it that doesn’t seem like underflavoring, it seems like that’s just how it vapes, though of course I could be wrong. I’ll try it again at 1.5% and see if it hits better or is just an inherently softer flavor. **TASK 31**

**Ginger**

No clue. Will try 0.25%. **TASK 32**

**Golden Apple**

Ditto. **TASK 33**

**Grape**

Very natural, sweet red grape flavor. I have red table grapes in my fridge right now and this is perfectly like them. Just the right amount of tannic skin taste balanced appropriately with a mild but sweet and juicy body.

This is the best natural grape I have tried. But, I think more often than not when it comes to grapes, people are actually looking for that artificial PURPLE flavor. This is not that. Seriously considered tossing it just because I don’t think I’d feel incomplete without a very natural red grape flavor, but I’ll first give it a chance in both of the two public recipes that use it.

[MF Grape](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/50938-mf_grape). **TASK 34**

[Fizzy Grapple](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/fizzy_grapple_22). **TASK 35**

**Grapefruit**

Very potent and accurate. Doesn’t really taste like the kind of pink grapefruit I like, which are those Ruby Red grapefruits that are really red inside, tastes more like the ones you get that are called pink grapefruit but inside they’re just kind of orangey light pinkish coral type color. A bit top heavy, a bit throaty, but really flavorful and natural-tasting grapefruit.

I doubt there’s any room for improvement in [Grunch](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/162546-grunch) but just to be thorough, I’m going to try subbing 0.5% MF Grapefruit for the 0.25% INW White Grapefruit. **TASK 36**

**Green Apple**

Have not tried it. Based on a couple of recipes, it looks like 1% might not be a bad place to start with this one. **TASK 37**

**Green Tea**

Will try 0.25% sample. **TASK 38**

**Guava**

One recipe suggests that 1% wouldn’t be a bad place to start with this one, but I’ll try a slightly more careful 0.75% sample. **TASK 39**

**Hazelnut**

This one I’ll probably start at 0.25%. I might smell this, decide it’s probably not that strong, and go 0.5% or 1% instead. **TASK 40**

**Honeydew**

Looks like 0.5% would be ok for this one. **TASK 41**

**Jasmine**

The only recipe using this has it at 1%, but it’s an older recipe with no reviews, I’ll try 0.5%. **TASK 42**

**Kiwi**

No recipes but 0.5% probably won’t be over-flavoring. **TASK 43**

**Lemon**

Nine recipes for this one, making it one of MF’s more popular flavors on ATF. I see it being used from 0.06% up to 0.6%, but 0.25% seems like a good place to start with a sample. **TASK 44**

[Fiddy’s LMP](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/214763-fiddys_lmp__lemon_meringue/) is already on my to-mix list. Will also try this [Lemon Grab Parfait](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/133405-lemon_grab_parfait) that claims MF Lemon is the best lemon flavor out there. **TASK 45**

**Light Chocolate**

Have not tried. One MTL recipe uses it at 1.25%; I’ll sub-ohm a 0.75% sample. **TASK 46**

**Lime**

This one will also get the 0.25% treatment. **TASK 47**

**Mandarin**

Ditto. **TASK 48**

**Mango**

At 1%, I thought the first couple hints of this were way too floral, not perfumy, but floral, but the more I vaped, the more I appreciated how non-perfumey and pleasant it was. It’s just kind of a violet-ish, rose-ish floral that tastes very natural. If you just smell a stack of mangoes, there _is_ some floral aroma there, like if flowers grew on pine trees that grew on tropical islands. This sort of captures that. There’s the lightest hint of that piney thing. The base is sweeter and tastes more mangoey than anything else, but is kind of subtle, too, not all up in your face, so it really kind of tastes more like the experience of cutting up a bunch of mango rather than eating or drinking it.

It’s not a bad flavor, but because I have so many other, better mangoes, because there are no recipes that use it, and because I feel like I’m doing a terrible job at getting rid of flavors this week, I’m going to let this one go. **TRASH 3**

**Mint**

Tempted to toss it without ever having tried it just for being called “mint” and not something more specific (Spearmint, peppermint, what kind of mint we talkin bout here?). But, I’ll give it the ol’ 0.5% try anyway. **TASK 49**

**Morello Cherry**

No recipes and because I’ve developed a healthy respect for the potential awfulness of cherry flavors, will start with just 0.25% on this one, subject to change once I open and sniff it. **TASK 50**

**Nectarine**

Likely another 0.25% sample. **TASK 51**

**Orange**

Likely another 0.25% sample. **TASK 52**

**Passionfruit**

So the first time I tried this, at 0.4%, it was really really light and soft. It tasted like passionfruit, undeniably, but was just a soft flavor. I pushed it up to 0.8% And it’s definitely more flavorful, but still relatively soft and lacking body. Really natural but at the same time, lacking, like La Croix passionfruit. It’s kinda thin, especially in the middle. Kinda tart on up front, some sweeter passion fruit flavor in the finish, lotta dead space in the middle. Might actually make a great background passionfruit note for something like a tropical drink though, if it doesn’t get steamrolled. It does have some lingering passion fruit essence, I wouldn’t call it thick, sweet, or flavorful enough for passionfruit juice, but passion fruit essence, after the exhale, and I think that linger is promising for it possibly being able to show though just a little in a mix, despite being soft. It could be that this is just a soft, thin flavor, or it could be that it’s considerably less potent than other Medicine Flower flavors and needs to be mixed even higher than 0.8%. No throat hit, very smooth, which is kinda remarkable compared to some other passion fruit flavors.

Another one that’s not bad, but I don’t feel like I need to keep it when I have WF Passionfruit, PUR Passion Fruit, VT Yellow Passion, and the one I love most, CNV Passionfruit. **TRASH 4**

**Peach**

Don’t have high hopes because I’m assuming that if it were great, someone would have used it in a public recipe on ATF by now, but I’ll give it a try at 0.5%. **TASK 53**

**Peanut**

0.25% sample on this one. I’ve been burnt by peanut/peanut butter flavors before. **TASK 54**

**Pear**

A bright, fresh, natural sweet pear flavor that’s noticeably juicy. Most natural of the pear flavors I’ve tried. No off notes for me, though it’s so bright I can see it coming across as having a touch of citrus or green apple to some people more sensitive to those types of notes. That’s the first thing I thought of when tasting it, too, that I’d like to try mixing this with lemonade flavor and make a pear-lemonade juice. Top heavy but not super thin. I still want to layer it to fill in the base and texture just a bit more but this is a very, very good crisp authentic pear. Medicine Flower is a bit pricey but sometimes, not always, but sometimes, you get what you pay for. This is one of those times.

Shocking to not see any recipes using such a great flavor. That’s fine, though, I’ll make my own.

Like You Got A Pear V1 **TASK 55**

| Co. | Flavor        | %    |
| --- | ------------- | ---- |
| MF  | Pear          | 0.75 |
| MB  | Shape-Up Pear | 2    |
| TFA | Honeysuckle   | 0.5  |
| INW | Prickly Pear  | 1    |
| BCF | WS-23         | 0.5  |

Just a chilled, juicy pear.

_Note: Discovered that I had MF Pear listed twice on my spreadsheet so I’ve revised my starting flavor count accordingly._

**Pineapple**

So, first of all, 0.2% is a full-flavored dose of this stuff. It’s strong as a single flavor, probably too strong. People say it’s expensive and I agree, it would be a bit of an investment upfront. But if you only need 0.2% (or less), then it could be 10 times the price of a flavor you need 2% of and still not be overpriced. But, but, is it really that good? I don’t think it is, comparatively, at least not at 0.2%, possible using it even low is better. It absolutely mostly tastes like real fresh pineapple, but it’s a little harsh and very slightly oniony at 0.2%. It’s good, but it might not be the best option. **TRASH 5**

**Plum**

I found it somewhat floral, but not perfumy, like a natural floral. A little tart. It’s like eating a slightly underripe plum right off the tree while there are still many blossoms all over the tree and you’re just eating a crisp plum right off the tree, while inhaling all those flowers. It’s not very sweet, really tastes like it was too soon to pick this one. On the other hand, it’s a bold, natural-tasting flavor with a lot of depth and some sweetness, just not that candy-sweet juicy plum I’m looking for. At 0.75%, MF Plum seems like the kind of flavor I might use at half or even a quarter or less percent to give another sweeter, juicier flavor some of that tart skin note with a natural florality, but I don’t feel like I need to have it. **TRASH 6**

**Pomegranate**

Have not tried, 0.25% sample. **TASK 56**

**Raspberry**

Medicine Flower has two raspberries, just plain Raspberry and Wild Raspberry. If you got this one, you got the wrong one, apparently, because people rave about Wild Raspberry. The domesticated Raspberry is not bad, but it definitely doesn’t seem worth the $12 per 15ml I paid for it, even if it is full potency raspberry flavor at just 0.5%. MF Raspberry is a fairly flat berry flavor that more or less tastes like raspberry. A bit floral, but not perfumy, but also somewhat candish in the way that it’s flat. Think of it this way, I expect a natural flavor to be in 3D and this is more of a 2D flavor. Pretty thin, not much depth here, but some sweetness beyond that more prominent top note of slightly floral berry. I wouldn’t hesitate to mix someone else’s recipe that uses it, but I wouldn’t recommend buying it to anyone, either. It’s a mediocre flavor at a premium flavor price. **TRASH 7**

**Red Apple**

I’ve not tried this as a single flavor but I have used it to create a recipe because someone made a donation to a cause tied to a request that I do that. [Fiddy’s Suppository](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/229245-fiddys_suppository/). I think I’ll mix that again and see if I think it needs to be revised now that I’ve got time to work on it instead of mixing it live on YouTube. **TASK 57**

Will also try a single-flavor sample at 1.25% **TASK 58**

**Root Beer**

This one’s not even in ATF’s database. Will start with 0.25%. **TASK 59**

**Rose**

FA Rose got me scared to start any higher than 0.25% with this one. **TASK 60**

**Strawberry**

Another one that I used in Fiddy’s Suppository but haven’t tried standalone. Will go for 1.5% - this is definitely not as potent as many other MF flavors. **TASK 61**

**Tropical**

Hate the name and don't think MF is great at tropical flavors based on the few I've tried, but will sample 0.25%. **TASK 62**

**Vanilla**

This is an ingredient in four of the recipes I put on the list today. They all use it at 1%, so I’ll try it at 1%. **TASK 63**

**Violet**

I don’t have any guidance for this one so 0.25% it is. **TASK 64**

**Walnut**

One of the recipes I just added has it at 0.33% but the notes say some people like the flavorings at 1.5 times the values listed, so I don’t think 0.5% will be overflavored. **TASK 65**

**Watermelon**

I haven’t tried this as a single flavor. In my first attempt at Fiddy’s Suppository, I tried using it at 0.75% and that proved to be way too much. It made it both overly rindy and a little soapy. Dropping to 0.4% and the second and third (final) versions worked beautifully. I’ll try 0.5% as a single flavor and hope that’s not too much. **TASK 66**

**White Cherry**

One very old public recipe uses it, at 0.25%. I’ll try that. Even though I’m scared. **TASK 67**

**White Chocolate**

Very excited to try this one, as I’m very much on the lookout for a great white chocolate option. Recipes suggest 0.75% should work to get a first impression of it. **TASK 68**

**White Peach**

Seriously doubt this is gonna beat FA White Peach but will try a 0.25% sample (or more if it doesn’t smell too strong). **TASK 69**

**Wild Raspberry**

Haven’t tried this one but I am looking forward to trying it, I hear great things. Recipes use it in the 0.2% to 1.5% range, with most being in the sub-zero numbers. I’ll give it a try at 0.5%. **TASK 70**

Speaking of those recipes, some of them look so good, I think I’ll try five of them while I’ve got the Wild Raspberry out.

[Raspberry Chunk](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/82476-raspberry_chunk) “Vanilla ice cream with ripples of raspberry and chunks of dark chocolate” **TASK 71**

[Raspberry Lemon Vanilla Ice Cream](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/182453-raspberry_lemon_vanilla_ice_cream) **TASK 72**

[Raspberry Sodaburst](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/231263-raspberry_sodaburst). Like a root beer float but with raspberry soda instead of root beer. **TASK 73**

[Monte Carlo](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/166197-monte_carlo) Cookie sandwich with raspberry jam and cream filling. **TASK 74**

[The Rumble Crumble](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/251758-the_rumble_crumble). Raspberry crumble. **TASK 75**

**Wildflower Honey**

Strange that the one with “wildflower” in the name is the less floral of the two Medicine Flower honeys, but it is, by a lot. It has only a hint of gentle floral. Instead, it has a tea-like off note. A little bitter, not in a chemical way, but just like black tea.It tastes like tea sweetened with lots of honey. But not too much honey, because it’s not really very sweet at all, not for a honey flavor. I think this is probably the honey I’d use for a honey-sweetened tea vape, though I’d want to bring in a little more tea and I’d probably have to add something to emulate the sweetness of the honey, maybe some VT Golden Syrup or something like that, or maybe just sweetener.

I really enjoyed the one recipe I’ve tried that used it, [Sweet Venom](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/230770-sweet_venom), but it’s been awhile and I don’t remember whether I loved it enough to keep MF Wildflower Honey just to be able to mix it again. I’ll give it another go and then decide. **TASK 76**

New Flavor Count: 2,158
