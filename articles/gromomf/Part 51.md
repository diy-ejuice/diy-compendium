TASK OR TRASH - Each flavor gets assigned at least one task or it goes in the trash.

#HANGSEN

**Raspberry**

HS Raspberry doesn’t taste bad, but it doesn’t really taste like raspberry. It tastes like sweet candy that can’t decide whether it wants to be strawberry or a raspberry flavored. Slightly tart top notes that don’t reach a raspberry level tartness, more like a strawberry candy tartness, sweeter, with a kind of jammy red berry body, candied and syrupy, finishes sticky, like melted candy. Would need another raspberry flavor to be raspberry candy, would need another strawberry to really be a strawberry candy, but seems like it would be excellent for either of those.

I’ve read Concrete’s review where he calls out an off-putting green note in HS Raspberry at higher than 1% but I can’t see a need to want to take it that high, there’s plenty of flavor at 1% and even at 0.75%.

It’s one of those flavors where I’m not inspired to create something with it, but wouldn’t hesitate to try someone else’s creation that used it. Seeing no such recipes, **TRASH 1**

**Red Cola**

Can’t remember trying this. I don’t have high hopes for HS Red Colca, but I’ll give it a shot at 3%. **TASK 1**

**Red Energy**

The syrup used to create some Red Bull knock off, mostly. It’s much more potent concentration-wise and also seems to just have a punchier flavor than some of the others. It’s a little less sweet up high than some of the others while still having that same “whole pack of sweet tarts with some extra cherry ones melted in battery acid taste” that it should have - sweet and acidic with a slight bitter edge. The throat hit I’ve come to expect with that sort of flavor is present, but not out of line. It’s missing that Juicy Fruit gum background entirely - like an off-brand Red Bull wannabe. Finish is very sweet and syrupy. I’m good without Dollar Store Red Bull flavor. **TRASH 2**

**Rock Sugar**

I thought the rock part was supposed to refer to taking sugar and boiling it in water and then letting it crystallize as the water evaporates, creating sugar “rocks,” but after tasting it I think it might be a reference to crack rock. Not that I know what eating crack rock tastes like, but there’s a chemical off note in here similar to the way smoking crack smells. It is very sweet, and mostly bland, which would be accurate, but underneath that sweetness is a lurking plasticy awfulness not quite the same as any I’ve encountered in a vape before. It’s not quite cherry plastic off note and not quite FW Hard Candy hairspray off note, but something in between. It’s also vaguely fruity, in a pear-apple kind of way. The ingredients to rock sugar are supposed to just be sugar and water. If that’s what HS Rock Sugar is supposed to be, I wouldn’t drink the water at Hangsen HQ. **TRASH 3**

**RY4**

Tastes like RY4 but instead of thick, creamy caramel, it’s caramel-flavored cotton candy. It has that spun-sugar EM taste to it, a touch of vanilla, as well as a different, darker sweetness that’s more in the finish with the tobacco and separate from that. There’s definitely a fair amount of tobacco in here but it’s a different sort of bacco than I’m used to. It’s soft, but with woody and leathery notes. It tastes like it could be good with one or more of these aspects - caramel, vanilla, woody tobacco, leathery tobacco - boosted with other flavors. It also tastes like one should avoid mixing it with flavors with large amounts of ethyl maltol in them.

[1-2-3 Burley](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/210327-1_2_3_burley_) is one of my faves and I need it for that. So, even though it looks a little weird to me (Granny Smith and Apple Filling?!), I should probably try this [Soho Green](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/283919-soho_green) recipe derived from it. **TASK 2**

I’m excited to try [The Concubine](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/140934-the_concubine_) - - will sub FW Sweetener for the PUR Super Sweet that I don’t have - that looks like it might be outstanding. **TASK 3**

**Strawberry**

Leads with a green, stem-like top note that sets up the expectation of more realistic, earthier strawberry that it doesn’t deliver, but it does have some tartness to it that’s missing from some of the sweeter strawberries. It’s bright and slightly sweet. Although it does taste like a real strawberry, it’s about like eating one with the earthier seeds and darker red, deeper sweet outer layer cut off, and instead having just the green stem and much more tart white-ish inside. So, not a full-flavored natural strawberry on its own, but certainly tastes like a touch of it could be a part of one. At the same time, not earthy or too green to be part of a candy-type strawberry layer. But I have plenty of other strawberry flavors, better ones. **TRASH 4**

**Tobacco**

Name does not inspire a lot of confidence. 2% It’s difficult to describe; tastes what I imagine artificial tobacco flavor might taste like if I’d never tried a tobacco flavor. Dry but not excessively dry, sweet but not overly sweet, kind of resembles cheap cigar filling tobacco. Very generic. Name fits. **TRASH 5**

**Tobacco Blend**

Dry tobacco with a little caramelly sweetness and a touch of nuttiness. Similar to “Tobacco” flavor but with the addition of that caramelized sweetness and touch of nuttiness. Not far of from an RY4 type of flavor but where those are caramel forward and often have fair amount of vanilla, with just an accent of tobacco, this is generic cigar tobacco forward with a fair amount of dry and not buttery or sticky caramel-type flavor, no vanilla, and a touch of nuttiness. It’s not bad, I just don’t need it for anything. **TRASH 6**

**TU Tobacco**

Does the TU stand for toilet underwear? This is yucky. Have you ever cracked open a pecan and popped the nut meat into your mouth without looking at it, only to quickly realize it was rotten? This tastes a little like that, but with a dried tobacco leaf in there with the rotten nut. Nutty, sickly sweet like rot, and WRONG. Very much **TRASH 7**

**Turkish Tobacco**

Very weak. I feel like at 4% I didn’t use enough of this. There’s just not that much flavor to it. I’d rather the flavor be strange and hard to figure out what to do with than nearly non-existent. Maybe this gets better at a much higher concentration but it still feels like it’s going to be soft regardless. At 4% I just get a wisp of light, hay-like tobacco that’s a little sweet but not too terribly sweet. Not much else here. **TRASH 8**

**Vanilla**

It reminds me a lot of Inawera’s Shisha Vanilla, but as a single flavor it is inferior to that in almost every way. It’s almost the same vanilla as Shisha Vanilla, but doesn’t taste like it would be as assertive in a mix. It’s sweet but not that sweet; it’s smooth and creamy but not that creamy. Unless you’re very sensitive to INW Shisha Vanilla’s waxiness, or they reformulate and ruin it, I can’t think of a reason to need this. And even if Shisha V _were_ to disappear, Wonder Flavors has one that I think would make a better backup than HS Vanilla. **TRASH 9**

**Virginia Tobacco**

Light and bright, like toasted hay. Sweet, but not way out in sweet land, like hay made from sweet alfalfa. Compared to FLV Virginia? Very different. Same sort of hay grassy thing, but FLV is sharper and has some slight spice. Compared to INW TA Virginia? Much more natural/unprocessed without chemical additives tasting, lighter, softer, equally sweet, but same sort of lighter tobacco. Like cigarette tobacco and not that dark pipe tobacco. This is not at all a bad flavor, it’s just not one I have a pressing need for. **TRASH 10**

**Watermelon**

What the fuck. That does not taste anything at all like a watermelon. It tastes like rose candy. I’m so confused. I literally do not taste any watermelon in this at all. None. It kind of tastes like sweetened rosewater. Fucking ridiculous. I mean, it’s fine, for rose candy flavor, I guess, but why does it say watermelon on the bottle? Top note is straight up walking through a rose garden and there’s a powdery candy base similar to a sweet-tart or American smartie. **TRASH 11**

#Health Cabin

**Avocado**

Don’t believe I’ve tried this one yet. I’ll start sampling it at 1%. **TASK 4**

**Butter**

It might disappear into almost any mix but the first thing I noticed about this is that it’s quite a bit too sweet for butter. At the same time, there’s a bit of a sour edge to it, like this butter sat out just a little too long. But for the most part, it tastes like butter. Not nearly as heavy and rich as I want a butter to be, and a little soft/subtle overall, but butter. I have betta buttas. **TRASH 12**

**Cake**

That’s astoundingly bad for something called “Cake.” It tastes like a rotten pecan, just like HS TU Tobacco. If you've ever been cracking pecans and eating them without paying attention and you accidentally get a piece that’s shriveled, black, and bitter, you know exactly what I’m talking about. It’s a bit sweeter than that, like maybe if you candied a rotten pecan, but still tastes absolutely nothing like cake. **TRASH 13**

**Cantaloupe**

Possibly due to over-flavoring even at 1.5%, some of these HC flavors can be super-powered and I haven’t taken the time time to re-dilute it and try again, but hair spray. Indistinctly sort of yellow-orange-ish melon, with syrupy sweet depth but some harshness upfront and a distinctly hairspray off-note, like close dancing with a girl with big Texas 80s hair who is chewing melon gum. **TRASH 14**

**Caramel**

Also terrible, tastes like brown sugar plus cherry, complete with the sharp chemical edge you get with some brown sugar flavors and the new vinyl shower curtain you get with many bright red candy cherry flavors. Even if you ignore the bad parts... Brown sugar I get, but why does Caramel need to be so fruity? It’s messed up. **TRASH 15**

**Caramel Butter**

It does mostly taste like caramel and butter at 2%, but the butter tastes like movie theater and there's a bit of sourness to it, like the movie theater butter is past its prime. **TRASH 16**

**Cereal**

Nasty. You know how you make cinnamon toast in a toaster oven by spreading butter on toast and then sprinkling cinnamon and sugar on it and cooking it? Imagine if you left out cinnamon, did this, ate it, and then puked it up. That’s HC Cereal. I get a solid, crisp bready toast flavor upfront, followed by deep, thick, sugar butter, mixed with straight vomit. There might be a touch of corniness to that toast as well, making it a little more like cereal, but I was too grossed out by the vomit and in a hurry to get it out of my RDA to pay much attention to that. **TRASH 17**

**Cheese Cake**

Burnt crustless cheesecake. Very sweet, rich and creamy, thick and smooth, with little twang that tastes authentic... and a burnt off note. I guess that’s supposed to be the crust, but it just tastes burnt to me. Not sure burnt what. Maybe coffee? It’s not a strong burnt flavor but it’s enough to turn me off, and I’m not sure what if anything could cover it up other than something very dark - maybe this would be an ideal ingredient for a coffee or chocolate cheesecake. I’d try a recipe that used it like that if I saw one, but I don’t. **TRASH 18**

**Chocolate Cake**

Dark chocolate with a weirdly sour tangy, fruity sweetness. Slightly dry in texture or at least not creamy, which is more in line with cake, but otherwise I’m not really getting any cake flavor at all. The tangy sourness here is undoubtedly butyric acid, but it's not enough to taste like vomit any more than a Hershey’s milk chocolate bar tastes like vomit. In fact it tastes like it would do a pretty accurate milk chocolate flavor if you just added more milk to it, except for that the fruitiness tied to that sweetness. I don’t know if you could mix around that. Personally, I won’t be using this flavor at all, but if I were going to suggest a use for it, I’d recommend ignoring the “cake” in the name, adding some milky cream flavor (which should also fix that dryness) and then adding some fruit to embrace the fruitiness and make it some sort of Hershey’s milk chocolate and fruit combination. **TRASH 19**

**Chocolate White**

Have not tried, will do a 1% sample. **TASK 5**

**Coconut Candy**

Light artificial coconut flavor, lots of a strange off note that tastes like Digestion Plus from Arbonne. They say that Digestion Plus stuff is flavorless but that is a lie, it tastes like the pyramid scheme version of whatever it is that’s wrong with Health Cabin Coconut Candy. **TRASH 20**

**Crab Apple**

Didn’t sound very appetizing, at least not to me, but I tried it anyway. When I think of crab apples I think of little miniature wild apples that are too bitter to eat without cooking them into jelly. This has a little bitterness to it but not more than the average floral flavor, which is what it tastes like. As much a floral flavor as a fruit. Not perfumy but more natural, like the apple version of say, TFA Cherry Blossom, where it’s primarily a floral flavor but there’s some cherry fruitiness in there. Only with this one it’s more of a fuji apple blossom. People who like floral flavors might want to check it out. People who don’t will probably be offended if they get it hoping for an apple. Bitter green floral on top most similar to cherry blossom, but not unlike FA Jasmine or FLV Hibiscus, and some sweet-tart apple juice type fruitiness to the finish. I could see it working really well in a very interesting tea or something like that, but I’m not up for benign the pioneer who creates that. **TRASH 21**

**Cream**

Extra heavy heavy cream with a lot of buttery richness. Tastes DAAPy with the butter but a little fake, like a bit of movie theater fake butter mixed in heavy cream, and a very slight cheesiness, not like a gross horrible cheesiness but like a cream cheese. There’s also some sweetness to it but really no more than heavy cream has. 1% might have been too much. It’s also not especially smooth despite all that butter; it’s bottom heavy but a little dry on top. **TRASH 22**

**Creamy Vanilla**

Milky, slightly sour, very sweet vanilla cream. Not horrible old milk sour to me, just a little on the sour side, with an intense, artificial vanilla throughout. Mostly creamy, but a little chalky upfront. Not super thick. Comes across like a cheap vanilla frosting vanilla with a hint of not-super-fresh milk taste. **TRASH 23**

**Dark Plum**

Taste like someone made toilet wine out of prunes or raisins. Has cleaner, tarter, juicer, promising plum flavor at first, then quickly devolves into a very sweet but musty, dry, and slightly fermented raisin. Leaves a lingering raisin aftertaste and makes the room smell raisiny. If something could juice it up and fix that drier finish, I could see it getting into prune juice territory easily, not sure why you’d want that, but it’s an option. **TRASH 24**

**Egg Custard**

This one is a bit difficult to describe. It does not taste like custard. It tastes like under-sweetened meringue, or, because it’s nowhere near as sweet and sugary as meringue, like overcooked egg whites. Also, I’m still not describing it adequately because what little sweetness is there is a bit dark, like a light watered-down caramel. Very egg-whitey, slightly sweet, also a little dry, almost crispy, but not a powdery dryness. Not thick or rich, actually slightly thin. A mid-range flavor, not a lot of top notes and trails off at the end, but more in the middle. I might have used it to help fill out a meringue, if I felt like I needed to do that, but can’t think of what else to do with it. **TRASH 25**

**Egg Roll**

Haven’t tried this, will mix a sample at 0.75%. **TASK 6**

While I’m at it, a couple of recipes that use it:

[mlNikon’s Cream Puff](https://alltheflavors.com/flavor/health-cabin-egg-roll). Described as “crispy puff pastry with a sweet vanilla cream center” - which sounds good to me. **TASK 7**

And [Leader of the Band](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/180368-leader_of_the_band) - a lemon puff pastry, which, if successful, could be outstanding. **TASK 8**

**Juicy Green Mango**

That’s literally just a mango peel. Why would you vape a mango peel. You’re supposed to throw the peel away. What the fuck is wrong with people. It’s just this piney and green vegetal and tastes like something you might try to eat if you were lost in the woods. **TRASH 26**

**Fresh Green Mango**

See Juicy Green Mango. I think they might’ve somehow gotten ahold of two of the same flavors with different labels on it, and they only taste a little different because one bottle is older. Pretty much the same, but the “Fresh” does taste a little fresher. It’s just as piney but sweeter and tastes less like the ivy off the side of my house, not quite as vegetal. **TRASH 27**

**Fuji Apple**

It’s not a terrible sweet-tart-yet-red apple at all, but all the others are cleaner: This one has a grassy green top note. Just a touch, over a very sweet, syrupy base that’s like Fuji apple syrup. Fair amount of separation between that sharp grassy slightly floral top and the deep syrupy base, making it disjointed. If it were just that sweet candy-like base without the green apple peel thing on top, it would be great. It’s minor and I wouldn’t be afraid to mix someone else’s recipe using it, but I’m kinda lazy and I don’t know about bothering with trying to build a recipe around covering that up, though, since there are other great options. **TRASH 28**

**Graham**

Haven’t tried this but am looking forward to it, it smells like Golden Grahams in the bottle. Mixing 0.5% sample. **TASK 9**

**Green Orange**

Eating a sweet, juicy orange -- in a plastics factory. It’s worse than a slight plastic off-gassing off-note, it’s more plastic than orange. **TRASH 29**

**Hazelnut**

Have not tried this, will do a 1% sample. **TASK 10**

**Juicy Peach**

Ditto. **TASK 11**

**Lemon Soda**

Metallic lemon candy. I think they were trying to do something to make it seem fizzy, but all I get is a metallic taste, like trying to eat a Lemonhead candy and a nickel at the same time. Lemonhead candy on top, metallic off-note comes in quickly after that and carries to the finish. It’s possible this is better at a lower or higher concentration than 1%, but I didn’t play with it. And with plenty of other lemon things and no recipes using it that I want to try, I think I will not bother. **TRASH 30**

**Litchi**

There might be a sweet spot for this somewhere between 1 and 2%, but I wasn’t satisfied with the light amount of flavor I was getting from it at 1%, so I bumped it up to a little over 2% and got white grape jelly thoroughly mixed with a slightly chemical perfumey hair-sprayish floral. **TRASH 31**
