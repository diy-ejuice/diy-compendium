## FLAVORAH

**Acai**

FLV Acai is an interesting flavor. I love it. Half of FLV Acai is a natural and lightly tart, dark berry flavor that tastes kind of like a combination of blueberries, cranberries, and pomegranate. The other side of FLV Acai, the last half of the exhale, is a drier cocoa note, from what I've read, that's oddly actually accurate to acai That dry cocoa kind of lingers. It's a softer flavor but it's full and has a dense mouthfeel. It has no floral edge like many berries do. The room note on this thing is ridiculous. Standalone vaping it at 1%, bystanders are straight-up walking into a dense cloud made of Brookside Acai and Blueberry chocolates. But it doesn't quite taste that way to the vaper, as it's lacking quite a bit of sweetness and that chocolate room note comes across more like a dry bakery cocoa. No coil gunk from it.

I need FLV Acai to make more [Brookside Blues' Brother](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/261779#brookside_blues_brother_by_id10_t) by me. I'm proud of this recipe and love it. **TASK 1**

And other favorite, this one by Chemical Burn Victim: [None More Black](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/63181#none_more_black_by_chemicalburnvictim). **TASK 2**

Others I want to try:

[Palmana](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/144577#palmana_by_thefogvlog) - it says it uses the cocoa note in Acai to make a chocolate-covered banana. **TASK 3**

And other one that does the same thing, [Banaie](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/164646#banaie_by_swissbigdin). **TASK 4**

And another, plus butterscotch cream, [Bacai](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/206411#bacai_developedflv_by_ruderudi). **TASK 5**

**Alpine Strawberry**

Wild Strawberry on Steroids. Bold, sharp, bright, very concentrated strawberry that tastes not only natural, but like it was grown somewhere far from civilization. Really hard to say this is “better” or “worse” than any other strawberry because it's so different. Very deep and saturated flavor. Sweet, but no sweeter than a wild berry. Floral-ish... vapes kinda like a floral flavor but tastes... unique, not perfumy. Wild, without being too “green.” Probably has somewhat limited use, I can't see using it with bakeries or creams at all, probably not with candy stuff either. But yes with other natural fruits and definitely with florals. People who have trouble tasting other strawberries should definitely check it out. Fair warning, though, it will linger in your atomizer. I had to wash mine after a 1% tester. 1%, by the way, is way more Alpine Strawberry than anyone will ever need.

As interesting and unique as Alpine Strawberry is, I know I've never had much luck creating with it and I don't think I've even tried someone else's recipe using it that I've really wanted to mix a second time. But, I'll see if any of these can change that before giving up and tossing it:

[Fiddy's Pink Lemonade](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/214041#fiddys_pink_lemonade_by_fidalgo_vapes). Lots of great reviews on a really nice-looking recipe. **TASK 6**

Another berry lemonade, [Iceberry Lemonade](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/62529#iceberry_lemonade_by_jbird). **TASK 7**

Still very skeptical about bringing Alpine anywhere near creams, but [60 Hz](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/207350#60_hz_by_ediblemalfunction) strawberry custard will change my mind, if the reviews are to be believed. **TASK 8**

[Endgame: Strawberry](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/147649#endgame_strawberry_1_0_ga_by_borninfire138). It's just strawberry on strawberry. I like strawberries. **TASK 9**

**Amaretto Sour**

This is one of the weirder offerings from FLV. For starters I'm not getting any sour, or at least no more than the sour you'd get from like, a cherry cola. Which is pretty much what it tastes like, a very weird cherry cola. First off, when did FLV randomly start putting Koolada in stuff? Don't do that. A number of people who have tried this report it tasting pretty much as it should. I think it tastes more like some kind of oddly nutty flat cherry cola with a touch of some kind of floral and a tiny bit of koolada-type cooling added to it. No kind of alcoholic bite. And it's all sort of flat and mushy except for the coolant part at the end. Amaretto does taste like both cherry and almond mixed together, but this is more cherry and almond separate. As if someone tried to DIY amaretto by mixing together almond and cherry flavors and it didn't quite work for them. It's nutty. There's some spice to it but that spice would be out of place in an amaretto sour and is making it taste like something a lot more in line with cola, especially combined with the heavy dark sweetness and acidity. Finally, it tastes like a rose petal or two got slipped inside there somehow along with the brighter cherry. At least it has a brighter cherry without plastic or medicine? But it dragged a bunch of strange stuff along with that cherry - almond, caramel, coolant, cola, and something like a rose. It's kind of a mess, and I didn't find a recipe that made me want to even give it a chance. **TRASH 1**

**Apple**

Potent. Full flavored at 1%. Mostly tastes like apple juice. It has a really prominent deep and very syrupy sweet base that's more mellow, but still flavorful, really sweet without going candy. But it has some more tart, green apple right up front that gives it just a hint of that grassy kind of floral you can get with green apples. Nothing like the average green apple, but it's there and it's a little off-topic for what it mostly tastes like. Not dry, even a little juicy, but starts to feel increasingly drier after vaping it for a bit.

I have yet to try a recipe I need it for, but there are some great-looking ones I want to try before kicking it to the curb.

[Developed's Apple Fritter](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/138459#apple_fritter_developed_by_developed) **TASK 10**

[Sam's Applescotch Cookie Pie](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/203422#applescotch_cookie_pie_by_eyemsam) - that Crumble Topping. **TASK 11**

And his [Apple Eggnog](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/190533#apple_nog_by_eyemsam) **TASK 12**

[Country Apples](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/175982#country_apples_apple_filling_thai_caramel_butter_toffee_pear_pop_by_nonstopmix) **TASK 13**

[Pantless Krampus](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/130592#pantsless_krampus_by_slashalo) apple bacco **TASK 14**

**Apple Cider**

Very accurate un-spiced hard apple cider, emphasis more on cider than on apple. Nothing I would call an off-note. Similar to apple juice but tangier and darker like apple juice that's been cooked a bit, plus some warm, fermented funky booziness prominent and right out front. Not punch you in the face flavorful but low-key very flavorful - deeply saturated.
For most hard cider I'd want to brighten it up a bit with another apple flavor, maybe give it some effervent quality with something like Citrus Soda. For most classic apple cider type applications I'd want to bring some spice to the party, but I appreciate it being bring your own rather than having spices built in. Sweet enough but not especially sweet. Mixed with other things it seems like it might bring some nice warm and dark cookedness to an apple bakery since it's darker and the booziness is light enough.

I need it to make more [Deer Lodge](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/90272#deer_lodge_by_concreteriver), a fantastic apple cider pudding recipe and one of my all-time favorites. **TASK 15**

Since I'm keeping it, might as well try something different. [Sunrise Orchards](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/114629#sunrise_orchards_by_chemicalburnvictim) definitely looks different. **TASK 16**

**Apple Cranberry**

It's Ok, it's just a bit disappointing. I was really hoping that would be one of FLV's apples plus their wonderful FLV Cranberry but it's only half that. It's not that thick, smooth, and juicy Ocean Spray FLV Cranberry. Their cranberry is better than this. This is a thin, floral, cranberry behind a punchy and juicy red apple flavor, like their Apple flavor that mostly tastes like apple juice, but with it's green apple edge replaced with a sharp and somewhat harsh cranberry tartness. Also potent, 1% is a lot of flavor.

This flavor's hope of being kept by me now rests in the hands of these two really nice looking recipes:

[The Fall Waits For No One](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/117190#the_fall_waits_for_no_one_fried_sweet_pumpkin_donuts_by_mech_mod_rn) A fried pumpkin donut. **TASK 17**

[French Cranberry Parfait](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/154765#french_cranberry_parfait_ice_cream_by_besejuiced). Ice cream parfait **TASK 18**

**Apple Filling**

I know some folks get a weird off-note of some sort from this one but I don't know what's wrong with them. I fucking love it. The apple takes a bit of backseat to the cinnamon and seems like it could stand to be boosted with another apple or two, but what apple is there is a perfect representation of that cinnamony goop inside of something like an apple fried pie; it could just use some more apple for the chunks. But for the cinnamony goop, it's amazing. You get that absolutely perfect baked rich cinnamon flavor right on top, some goopy body, and a lingering sweet and sticky but ever so slightly tangy cooked apple finish. Apple is subtle enough I think it could be used to add that baked cinnamon goo flavor to just about any fruit, but especially it would be perfect for a baked pear.

I need it for Alfred's [Cabin](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/123685#cabin_by_alfredpudding) every fall, and when when I want to remember autumn. **TASK 19**

I also need it for my own [Spicy Icy Chamoyada Mangonada](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/116249#spicy_icy_chamoyada_mangonada_by_id10_t) **TASK 20**

But there are so many other things I want to try that use it, it's hard to choose. I had initially picked out 26(!) recipes, decided that was excessive, so here are the seven most irresistible-looking to me:

[WCSB](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/182918#wcsb_by_dragonlady). It looks, as one reviewer simply put it, “exquisite.” **TASK 21**

[American Pie Blend](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/126405#american_pie_blend_by_ebc88). Apple Pie Tobacco. **TASK 22**

~~[Applescotch Cookie Pie](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/203422#applescotch_cookie_pie_by_eyemsam). I'm just here for the WF Crumble Topping & Cookie Butter combo. **TASK 23**~~ Oops, I already put this one under Apple. What can I say, my memory is bad and it looks really good.

[K's Apple Pie](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/182491#k_s_apple_pie_by_kittybit). There are so many apple pie recipes using FLV Apple Filling, and most of them look good as hell, but the VT Red Dates in this one really piqued my interest. **TASK 24**

[Apple Butter](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/206705#apple_butter_developed_by_developed). Why yes, I do want to vape apple butter. **TASK 25**

[Banana Foster](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/169047#banana_foster_by_enyawreklaw). Apple Filling in a Banana Foster recipe? I need to see this in action. **TASK 26**

[Apple Crumble Cheesecake](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/251467#apple_mcduckie_improved_crumble_cheesecake_developed100_by_ninjaberry_cc). **TASK 27** One of the recipes from the recent Bull City Flavors Mystery Flavor contest left me wanting something just like this. I hope the mixer who made that got the FLV Apple Filling offered to them by /u/TeslaDelMar

**Apple Pop**

Bit odd but very flavorful. Mostly tastes like candied peel-on apples with a hint of spice. Not apple candy, but candied apple, kinda like you tossed apple bits in melted sugar. Prominent spicy and a little tart peel note on top and deep, penetrating sugary sweet red apple base. Spicy peel tastes a little like a light candy cinnamon but not exactly cinnamon, base is a very sweet red apple. Not dry but kind of powdery, like just-add-water cider mix or apple rolled in powdered sugar. Lingering cider-y sweetness. Definitely worth checking out as a layer for any apple application (apple-cation?) where a bit of peel, a bit of spice, and a lot of sweetness aren't unwelcome. Cider, apple pie and all the varieties like apple pie ice cream and apple pie liquor, cinnamon candied red apple, and so forth. Not bad when soaking wet but I noticed it's one of those flavors that starts to get harsh as the wick gets dry but long before it's completely dry.

I need it for the aforementioned Deer Lodge and if I'm going to be keeping it for one reason, might as well look into a couple of others.

[Bloodstone](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/229247#bloodstone_by_davidn2kl) Wild profile, “red apple dipped in butterscotch with coconut flakes,.” I'll bite. **TASK 28**

[Morning Bite](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/216524#morning_bite_by_dragonlady) Looks like a fruity mess, but we'll see. **TASK 29**

**Apricot**

Cleary an apricot, but kind of an odd one. The top notes are a little floral in the same way that peaches can be a little floral, not out of control flowers, but a little floral. Mostly, that makes it taste more like a peach. There's also some of that peach harshness that's too much for some but non-existent for others up there. Down low, it's a cooked apricot, spot on, just like the inside of one of Granny's apricot fried pies. It has that same sort of caramelized fructose flavor of baked fruit.

I know I really liked [Apricot Cream Tobacco](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/139296#apricot_cream_tobacco_by_fadedjay1) but I can't remember whether I liked it enough to keep restocking FLV Apricot. Memory needs a refresher. **TASK 30**

[Peach Foster Pudding Parfait](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/202506#peach_foster_pudding_parfait_flv_by_tamvapes) looks pretty good, too. **TASK 31**

**Arabian Tobacco**

I basically recommend all FLV tobaccos to everyone, but maybe a little less enthusiastically this one, especially to beginners, mostly because it's a lot more potent than most other FLV tobaccos And it has such an earthy, ashy taste to it. 0.25% is nearly full flavored and while I don't think it would necessarily go off badly at a little higher concentration, it does seem like it could be assertive in a mix. It tastes more like a roll your own cigarette tobacco retrieved from a half-smoked rollie, rather than a pipe or cigar type tobacco. Ashy, but more smokey than ashy. Very dry. Some spice notes to it that I can't quite place other than warm, in fact it's more spice than tobacco, but earthy, ashy spice. Kinda like clove, but not really clove. No sweetness at all, which is nice in a tobacco, tastes even less sweet than straight VG, there's a bit of bitterness to it like black tea that goes along with that dryness and cancels out the VG sweetness.

I keep being tempted to make a child bride-themed recipe using a picture of the Prophet Mohammed to see if I can get ATF HQ suicide bombed, and am thinking of tossing this flavor just to remove the temptation. Unfortunately, I cannot do that, because i need it to make more of an incredibly awesome recipe, [Arab Mom's Butter Cookie](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/197505#arab_mom_s_butter_cookie_by_nowar). **TASK 32**

Might as well check out some other stuff, too.

[Wolfwood](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/214918#wolfwood_by_wolfwheeler) “A dark berry tobacco with thick and bright currant,” with multiple effusive reviews? Sign me up! **TASK 33**

[1321 ACAB](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/278386#1312_acab_by_wolfwheeler) Maybe the first time my main reason for trying a recipe is the name. **TASK 34**

**Avocado**

Doesn't really taste like avocado, but shares some avocado prosperities. I get lots of buttery rich body, without vanilla or dairy cream. A really silky feel, tastes a little nutty, and also like it has a little olive oil in it, with the just the tiniest hint of banana. It is a strange one but it also seems like it could have a lot of value as a cream additive. I don't think I've ever tried a recipe that used FLV Avocado, but now I'm not going to. Even though there's nothing really off-putting about it, I just didn't see one I was sufficiently interested in. **TRASH 2**

_Flavorah is really not making this getting rid of flavors thing easy_

I went over reddit's character limits, so I broke what I had in two, part 27 will be up in a few minutes.
