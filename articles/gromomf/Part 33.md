## CAPELLA

**Fig**

Update. I tried [Go fig-ure](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/26440#go_fig_ure_by_chrisdvr1). It’s not going in the rotation, but it’s got me looking forward to the [version with FW Black Currant](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/26999) which is apparently the original and better recipe and is a little further down on the to-do list. I’m convinced that CAP Fig is a great pairing for FA Forest Fruit. Because it’s neither fully a fresh fig (FA, for example) or dried fig (FLV, for example), weird-ish fruit mixes seems to be the best use for CAP Fig. I don’t see anything else like that, though, so I’ll try some things of my own. Bumbleberry because it’s Wonder Flavors’ version of Forest Fruit and I’m hoping to bumble into something awesome. Don’t mix these! They might be terrible. I’m experimenting here.

**Custard Cake**

Update, again. I just added this [Tres Leches](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/280072#tres_leches_by_kylezkloudz) recipe to the list last week because the first Tres Leches cake recipe I tried using CAP Custard Cake was ruined by SSA Clotted Cream. I also mixed a Lemon Pound cake that I cracked open this week after a steep, but the coconut and other weird off-note from FLV Pound Cake messed that one up. The issues with these recipes were not CAP Custard Cake’s fault. I was already planning to try [Car-Nilla Custard Cake](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/294242#car_nilla_custard_cake_by_lynda_marie), will add one more CAP Custard Cake recipe: [Pony’d Up Donut](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/290828#pony_d_up_donut_raspberry_orange_by_dippindabbin), a raspberry-orange donut. **TASK 4**

**Double Chocolate V2**

Update. I tried [Chocomisu](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/226271) and rounded up to 5 stars. It was indeed an extra-chocolatey tiramisu and I couldn’t find anything wrong with it other than not really being able to find the ladyfingers under everything else. It tasted great, no problem at all with the CAP Double Chocolate V2. But, rather than make me want to mix it again, it made me want a tiramisu vape without the extra chocolate. Extra motivation to hurry and work my way down to SSA Tiramisu.

This [After 8](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/194544) recipe is awesome, mostly because FLV Crème De Menthe is awesome. I probably won’t mix it again though, because jbird’s [Skinny Mint](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/6997#skinny_mint_by_jbird) is a thing that exists. It’s not that Skinny Mint is a “better” recipe, it’s just personal profile preference. I’d rather vape (and rather eat) Thin Mints than After 8 mints. And I only need so many mint chocolate recipes on my list of personal faves.

Even though neither of these recipes wind up on my must-make-again list, they both convinced me that CAP Double Chocolate V2 is an ingredient I should explore further. My first thought is that maybe I’m looking in the wrong place in my attempts to remix my old chocolate RY4 recipe. I’m gonna try something.

Ravenous - CAPDCV2 Version **TASK 5**

| Co. | Flavor              | %    |
| --- | ------------------- | ---- |
| JF  | RY4 Double          | 4    |
| FLV | Red Burley          | 0.75 |
| FLV | Kentucky Blend      | 0.25 |
| CAP | Double Chocolate V2 | 1.5  |
| WF  | Salted Caramel      | 2.0  |
| CAP | French Vanilla      | 0.75 |

The other thought is that I should try more CAP Double Chocolate V2 recipes, such as:
[Top Tier Cookie](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/248694#top_tier_cookie_by_sensory_overload). I have some concerns about a couple of those ingredients but the reviews sold me. **TASK 6**

And [Monkey Cake](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/274024#monkey_cake_by_vivavape). **TASK 7**. Right after I order more OoO Cornbread, if I haven’t already by the time I get down to this. **TASK 8**

**Double Apple**

Update. I tried a recipe thinking it would likely be one of my reasons to keep CAP Double Apple, but the combination of apple and citrus was a little too sharp for my taste. My other reason for keeping it was just in case I wanted to mix some more Water-malone, but since I still don’t feel like doing that, it’s probably not a good enough reason. It is used in the [Appermelon Gummies Candy](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/67603#appermelon_gummies_candy_by_steamon) recipe that I’m already planning to try and it seems like a solid flavor, so instead of ditching it, I’ll go on a deeper dive looking for things to mix. I found:

[Prickly Soda](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/166079#prickly_soda_by_vishousvapez) and remembered that I wanted to try it a long time ago, but got sidetracked doing other things with INW Prickly Pear. **TASK 9**

No idea how I managed to miss this [Apple Flapple](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/145960#apple_flapple_by_nickevz) recipe when looking for things to make out of FLV Apple Filling, but it’s on the list now despite the scary large amounts of VT English Toffee and WF Flapper Pie. **TASK 10**

[Albatross](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/201303#albatross_by_dumhed) is such a weird mix of fruity flavors that I can’t imagine what it actually tastes like beyond probably tasting kinda similar to a kiwano melon. Time to find out. **TASK 11**

[Wumpa Fruit](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/306723#wumpa_fruit_by_cam9535) Less weird, just apple and mango. **TASK 12**

Lots of recipes that mix apple and melon together, but [Deuces Wild](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/231055#deuces_wild_by_rocky02852) stands out for its simplicity. **TASK 13**

## FLAVORAH

**Native Tobacco**

Max Savage’s favorite thing to add to everything at 1%. I think this is my favorite standalone tobacco. Pretty much tastes like inhaling from a bag of quality roll-your-own cigarette tobacco, but with a slight spiciness and a hint of honey-like sweetness.

My main need for this is to make more [RY4 Custard](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/134966#ry4_custard_developed_by_developed). Spiced tobacco with creamy custard and caramel notes and I love it. **TASK 14**

It also appears in another of my all-time favorites, [Long Gone Lonesome Blues](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/106454#long_gone_lonesome_blues_blueberry_creme_brulee_tobacco_by_lonesomerhodestn). Insane profile “blueberry creme brulee tobacco” but it really works. **TASK 15**

It shows up in a handful of recipes I’m already planning to make. Here are a few more additions:

[Paradeisi](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/110368#paradeisi_by_lonesomerhodestn). Long Gone Lonesome Blues worked so well, why shouldn’t I try it with the blueberries replaced with strawberries? **TASK 16**

[Gatsby](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/100160#gatsby_by_maxsavage). I’m intrigued by the INW AM4A and FLV Milk & Honey in there. **TASK 17**

[Golden Boy](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/136243#golden_boy_by_maxsavage). Honey custard tobacco! Yes, that’s two Max Savage recipes in a row. The man loves his Native Tobacco and when someone loves an ingredient that much, it makes me want to try things they’ve made with it. **TASK 18**

[Maple Nilla Tobacco](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/221952#maple_nilla_tobacco_by_mindfloodz). What an interesting use for WF Maple Syrup Candy. **TASK 19**

[Zvara](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/133566#zvara_by_nks). Spiced butterscotch tobacco? I’m surprised this doesn’t have any reviews yet. I’ll bite. **TASK 20**

**Nectarine**

Only if “nectarine” is French for “new vinyl shower curtain liner.” YUCK! **TRASH 1**

**Oak Barrel**

Mellow, dry, woody top note flavor. Not sweet, slightly bitter. Just a bit of creamy vanilla in the base. Oddly smooth for something so dry. There’s a very faint smokiness to it that I didn’t get at first, but started to notice more as my wick got drier.

I need it for [Burly Boiz](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/69680#burly_boiz_by_matthewkocanda). Will try this [Cherry Oak Tobacco](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/97500#cherry_oak_tobacco_by_chemicalburnvictim), because INW Black Cherry for Pipe is so good. **TASK 21**

**Oatmeal Raisin**

Extremely potent, mostly raisin. I do not get a clear oatmeal cookie flavor out of this behind the raisin, but there’s some bakery something hiding back off in there, and a more prominent brown sugar note. Anyway, this can be the raisin in your oatmeal raisin cookie and tastes pretty on point for that, like a raisin that’s been baked into a cookie, but is on the overly musty side. For a raisin that hasn’t been baked and isn’t as funky, I much prefer their Rum Raisin. That bit of rum can be even easier to work around than the serious mustiness here, and it’s a little more forgiving as far as the concentration. Even just 0.75% Oatmeal Raisin can be a steamrolling amount and at 2% the funky mustiness rolls over into rotten-ish and yucky for me.

Already planning to mix [1312 ACAB](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/278386#1312_acab_by_wolfwheeler). I’ll try [Apple Oat Crumble RY4](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/286870#apple_oat_crumble_ry4_by_nowar) even though 2.5% Oatmeal Raisin makes me nervous. **TASK 22**

**Orange Citrus**

I get a warm half-orange half tangerine out of this one. The fruit flavor tastes natural, but soft, not a punchy citrus, and it feels thick and super waxy. Overall this is an odd flavor in that it has a natural citrus fruit taste, but the base is waxy like a waxy candy. Like Swedish Fish but flavored with natural orange and tangerine flavors. No easy or obvious use for this jumps out at me, except that the orange/tangerine tastes kinda cooked so if you’re going for something that involves a cooked orange, this might help with that, if you can get around the heavy waxiness, but I have SSA Bakery Oranges for that and no need to keep this. **TRASH 2**

**Oriental Tobacco**

Bright, slightly spicy, notably nutty, slightly woody, some caramelly sweetness, very smooth tobacco with no ash.

Quite nutty. A bit woody, specifically cedar-y, but that’s very light, just a touch of it.. Surprisingly sweet, not super sweet, but has some caramelly sweetness to it. No Ash. Very smooth, almost a creamy mouthfeel. Not as bright as FLV Virginia, but pretty bright. Much more complex than Virginia. Not as spicy as FLV Turkish, but has the same kind of spice note, just toned way down. That spice note is similar to a touch of cinnamon and a touch of cardamom, maybe a bit of clove or star anise as well, but it’s indistinct and very light, not prominent like in Turkish. It is actually pretty similar to Turkish otherwise. It’s brighter than Turkish, which is already pretty bright, but where Turkish is more hay-like or “grassy” as they say, Oriental is more nutty. It has that same kind of slightly cedar-like woodiness. Pretty forgiving as far as concentration goes, 2% just tasted like 1% only bolder, more robust, didn’t really bring out any off notes other than that caramelly sweetness in the base there getting a hint of butter-like taste to it. Not a lot, but enough to make it really start to taste of buttery caramel rather than being just caramel-ish.

I need it for the Wild Horses recipe that has come up several times recently. I also need it for [Arabian Night’s](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/86198#arabian_night_s_by_fear) - love the recipe, hate the apostrophe. Just realized I failed to leave this recipe a review when I had it before. Will correct that this time. **TASK 23**

I also want to try:

[Peanut Butter Hazelnut Tobacco](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/299980#peanut_butter_hazelnut_bacco_by_kuri_santou) because that sounds (and looks) great. **TASK 24**

And [Tobaco Zapatista](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/270156#tabaco_zapatista_by_riotcoon) which might be the savior of a couple of its ingredients. Coffee tobacco with caramel and vanilla accents. **TASK 25**

I went over the character limit by just a tish so I've broken this week's edition approximately in half, part 34 will up in a minute.

New Flavor Count: 2564
