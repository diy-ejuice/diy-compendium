TASK OR TRASH - Each flavor gets assigned at least one task or it goes in the trash.

#Liquid Barn

**Pacific Cooler**

It’s supposed to be a Capri Sun flavor and I’m a little surprised LB hasn’t gotten a C&D for that. Pacific Cooler is supposed to be pineapple, apple, and grape. It mostly tastes “fruity” and sweet with nothing really distinct, it’s dull overall. It is a bit sweet-tart like pineapple but not very bright or vibrant. It’s a little dry and a little harsh but not off in weird ways.

Don’t need it. **TRASH 1**

**Peach**

Imagine peach rings candy floating in a pool of baby vomit. There’s a decent, somewhat candied peach in there, but it’s essentially a peach and cream flavor, heavy on the cream, and the cream has been partially digested and then vomited back up. Some fruit flavors get away with having some butyric acid in there: TFA Juicy Peach has some, so does TFA Strawberry. TFA Papaya has it and while some people can’t stand it for that reason, I love the stuff. Dose makes the poison. But the dose of butyric acid in this one makes it repulsive to me. On the upside, not getting any harshness from it, just upchuck. **TRASH 2**

**Peppermint**

This is a very average peppermint. Pretty basic, solid starlight mint/candy cane type of peppermint. Sweet, but probably should be even sweeter for a candy-tasting peppermint. Not overly icy but has that little bit of peppermint bite, a little sharper than FW Candy Cane which is probably a good thing most of the time if you’re looking for a candy peppermint. Very lightly creamy-ish body, not thin.

Unlike their very popular White Chocolate Peppermint, I don’t see any recipes using this one, which means I don’t need it. **TRASH 3**

**Pineapple**

Incredibly boring pineapple. It just doesn’t have much in the way of flavor saturation. Flat and dull, not juicy and vibrant. Not what I’d call a thin flavor, but more just soft and maybe a little waxy. Not super harsh, but a high throat hit to flavor intensity ratio. It seems like there’s a better pineapple for anything you could want a pineapple flavor to do. **TRASH 4**

**Pink Lemonade**

Really tastes pink, like some part of an artificial berry flavor but not any whole berry in there. Almost aggressively sweet but also fairly tart, very reminiscent of Country Time Pink Lemonade, but really rough on the throat. It’s kind of annoying because it’s not really a full flavor below 4% (LB recommends a whopping 8%), but I kind of have to use it that low or it hurts. Works better as a sweet pinkish lemon accent than as the base or the main ingredient for a lemonade vape, unless it’s paired with something that will soothe that throat hit, like a strawberry with lots of maltol for strawberry lemonade or creams for something like a pink lemonade.... cream... thing.

On the subject of pink lemonade cream things, I used it in this old recipe, [Cherry Belonging](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/54852-cherry_belonging) that I already plan to remix because I can’t enjoy LB Vanilla Ice Cream anymore (gradually started tasting more and more like pepper, just like TFA VBIC did before that).

Will also try this [Pink Punch Lemonade Clone](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/175889-pink_punch_lemonade_clone/) that has some great reviews. **TASK 1**

**Pumpkin Pie**

I’ve seen a lot of people comment about how this one is an abomination. I think some of that might be people trying it at the 15% recommended by LB, which I wasn’t brave enough to do. But even at 8% it’s not great at all. I can definitely see where they were going with this as a pumpkin pie but there’s a strong off-note of tires. I’m not getting burnt tires, but like that smell of walking into a tire shop. It’s right up front and fairly noxious. It’s like they decided that “pumpkin spice” should include tire flavor. Beyond that, it’s mostly spice, and mostly clove at that, although there’s something behind the clove that’s not really distinct. Some nutmeg, sure. Maybe some cinnamon and ginger also, but mostly hidden by clove and tires, IDK. Behind all that spice there’s just a little bit of light bakery and weak but thick creamy, custard-ish finish that does taste quite a bit like pumpkin pie. It makes the whole thing actually taste like a pumpkin pie, but with way too much clove, being eaten in a tire shop. **TRASH 5**

**Purple Delight**

I don’t even know why I have this. I haven’t tried it but it doesn’t matter because it no longer exists. **TRASH 6**

**Root Beer**

At 9% I get too much throat hit from this. It hurts a little to vape it. But 5% seems plenty flavorful, with increased harshness seeming to be the main difference between 5% and the recommended 9%. It seems fairly well balanced and rather than those barrel candies, it tastes more like a flat root beer; it lacks anything resembling effervescence. Mouthfeel is ok for a beverage but it feels like it needs some more syrupy sweetness down low to be all it can be.

I have tried an all-LB root beer float recipe that used this before, and it worked reasonably well, so this is definitely a usable root beer flavor, but I don’t have a use for it. **TRASH 7**

**Sang Petillant**

Delicious, kind of relaxing flavor. Tastes like a citrus blend mimosa that’s mostly natural blood orange juice, with a splash of white grapefruit as well. Liquid Barn’s description mentioned “light notes” of white grapefruit so I was a little surprised when I tasted it (I had forgotten the mention by then) expecting a darker, earthier blood orange and got quite a bit of that bright and somewhat bitter white grapefruit. I had to go back and check the description. It seems like more than just a “light note” - I got a fair amount of that grapefruit. Anyway, I was pleasantly surprised by it, but if you’re not a fan of grapefruit, you might not be. But it’s really good and really has a sparkling champagne finish. I think it also really does what it set out to do, it evokes a certain level of decadence. I feel like I should be vaping this on a yacht or by a pool that belongs to a celebrity at a house in the Hamptons.

As good as it is, personally, I think I’d rather vape [Grunch](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/162546-grunch), which is more unapologetically a grapefruit mimosa without all that blood orange in there. So, I don’t need to mix this one-shot again. **TRASH 8**

**Snickerdoodle**

It tastes like sugar cookie dough with red hots candies crunched up in it. The cinnamon does have some bakery cinnamon to it but there’s also a definite red hots or big red gum flavor in there. And that’s the top note, just cinnamon. The rest is a rich, thick, bakery dough that doesn’t taste like it’s been cooked at all. I like my snickerdoodles soft and gooey, like softer and more gooey than you get with CAP Sugar Cookie, but this is ridiculous. It’s raw dough. There’s some pretty serious throat hit that comes up front with this cinnamon, but the rest of the exhale sort of smooths it out with that thick raw dough, sort of like putting out a fire. I don’t know. This might work better at a lower % than the recommended 8% or with a longer steep but I’m probably not going to wind up keeping it for long.

I have already planned to mix one recipe with it, though, a “Vanilla Fudge Filled Snickerdoodle” that uses it at 6.5%.

I’m a little confused and disturbed by the little bit of LB White Chocolate Peppermint in it, but just in case that’s some kind of stroke of genius, I’ll also try this [Sweet Cinnamon Buns](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/285713-sweet_cinnamon_buns_mwc) recipe that uses it at 3%. **TASK 2**

**Sour**

Not really sour, but it did leave me feeling like I’d eaten something sour a while back. Like the lingering barely-there effect of having eaten some Warheads candy like an hour earlier. I don’t really know what’s in LB Sour, but if I had to guess I’d say it’s probably just a slightly higher concentration of malic acid than TFA Sour.

I don’t like what it does to wicks (breaks them down and makes them not last as long). Not that it would be a terrible price to pay for really, really sour awesomeness, but with it barely being sour at all anyway, hardly seems worth mixing with it. **TRASH 9**

**Sour Gummy**

The most wrong thing about this is that its suggested use percentage from LB is 17%. DO NOT DO THAT. It’s riddled with off notes that high, all kinds of plastic like the worst cherry flavor you can imagine. Use 4 to 5% instead. Aside from that, it isn’t really very sour, any more than an average green apple flavor is sour. It’s a bit waxy but not thick. It’s sticky sweet but pretty thin. It really smells like a freshly opened bag of mixed gummy bears but when vaped it’s more like licking them rather than chewing them up. It might work well as an additive to make a fruit taste more like a gummy fruit because it has that authentic gelatin candy top note, but it’s still going to need something else to fill it out. I’m good without it. **TRASH 10**

That’s all I have time for this week, it’s been a rough week.
