TASK OR TRASH - Each flavor gets assigned at least one task or it goes in the trash.

#CAP Anise

Update. I said I would get rid of CAP Anise as soon as I finished stealing the profile from a recipe that uses it to make a better recipe. Not there yet. My first attempt at creating “The Ashton” was 5% VSO Chai Tea, 2% WF Papaya, and 1.5% WF Vanilla Cream Extra. After letting it steep for a week, the only things I’m convinced of are that I still want to pursue this and that Vanilla Cream Extra is the right vanilla cream for the job. The Chai spice was too light and the papaya just a little too prominent. It wasn’t bad, it just wasn’t perfect. I’ll try rebalancing it with less Papaya.

The Ashton V1.2 **TASK 1**

| Co. | Flavor              | %   |
| --- | ------------------- | --- |
| VSO | Chai Tea            | 5   |
| WF  | Papaya              | 1   |
| WF  | Vanilla Cream Extra | 1.5 |

But at the same time, I want to try a version with two different ingredients and see if that seems headed in a comparatively better direction.

The Ashton V3 **TASK 2**

| Co. | Flavor              | %    |
| --- | ------------------- | ---- |
| FLV | Chai Spice          | 1    |
| TFA | Papaya              | 0.75 |
| WF  | Vanilla Cream Extra | 1.5  |

That’s called V3 because I had already made a plan to try mixing a V2 several chapters ago, using just FLV Thai Chai and TFA Papaya.

#INAWERA

Thought I was done with Inawera but I overlooked a few of these last week.

**Shisha Orange**

Valencia Orange Italian Soda Syrup. Sweet, syrupy-textured orange just like that soda syrup, which tastes like real oranges were actually used in making it, but it’s not OJ or biting into an orange while also not being as fake tasting as the orange flavor in something like Sunkist. Smooth for a citrus flavor.

I have one Shisha Orange recipe lined up. Here’s another that I think will probably taste at least good, if not great. [MlNikon’s Orange Cake](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/202151-mlnikons_orange_cake). Emily rarely disappoints. **TASK 3**

**Shisha Strawberry**

I’m aware of people reporting tasting a kind of green “stem” note or underripeness in this one and I can almost see where they’re coming from, but for the most part it just tastes just like strawberry syrup to me. Like Smucker’s Strawberry Syrup that you might use on pancakes or as an ice cream topping, where the main ingredient is high fructose corn syrup, followed by real strawberries, and then whatever is included in “natural and artificial flavors.” Perhaps not quite as thick and syrupy, nor as bright, as that, but pretty close. Very smooth and sweet. Fairly vivid and vibrant flavor.

Obviously I’m not throwing away Shisha Strawberry. I’m not even going to count how many recipes I want to mix that use it that have been previously highlighted here. Just adding a couple more to the list that look too good to pass up.

[Toffee and Strawberries](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/187738-toffee_and_strawberries) Such an interesting pairing, Toffee Ice Cream and Strawberries. **TASK 4**

[Strawberry Strudelhaus - Esdeath Tribute](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/strawberry_strudelhaus_esdeath_tribute). First, Esdeath is one of my favorite recipes. Would I like to try it in strawberry instead of blueberry? Hell yes. Also, Strawberry Sturdelhaus would look delicious if I’d never heard of Esdeath. **TASK 5**

**Vanilla Cream**

It’s nice and thick and creamy and smooth, but the vanilla runs a bit floral for my taste. Definitely a reminder that vanilla comes from an orchid. There’s also a hint of coconut, especially in the finish. Overall, it’s a bit odd, but I wouldn’t call it unpleasant and it could easily be useful. Between the floral vanilla and coconutty base, it tastes vaguely tropical.

I need it for a couple of recipes I’m going to try, here’s one more, a pumpkin spice cream cake thing: [Pumpkin Head](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/292339-inspired_bymwc_pumpkin_head_). **TASK 6**

#Jungle Flavors

**Bavarian Cream**

The most custardy of the Bavarian Creams. Very sweet, pronounced bright vanilla. Custardy base, with some eggy bit and a hint of butteryness along with the dairy flavor that comes in on the finish. More than the others, it emphasizes that Bavarian Cream is supposed to be a type of custard. But it’s on the thin side of custards, not nearly as thick and rich as many of them. Like a runny custard. Very smooth.I noticed a hint of caramel or brown sugar at 4% that I didn’t get from it at 3%, so it’s in there, but it’s not prominent.

I have four or five recipes with it lined up already, one more won’t hurt: [Cause ‘tard](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/275597-cause_tard) looks like a solid if not terrific vanilla custard and I’m really intrigued by that little bit of TFA Kettle Corn in here. **TASK 7**

**Biscuit**

Notably better than INW Biscuit. It’s like INW Biscuit is a piece of unpolished furniture and this is the polished version. It’s very similar to INW Biscuit, but better. Weaker in concentration but that’s not necessarily a bad thing; it’s more forgiving and easier to work with. But, also probably not a great 1:1 replacement. It’s maybe too different in other ways, definitely too different in concentration. It blends better with other flavors and doesn’t stick out as much as INW. It’s softer and sweeter, without that sharper nutty edge that INW has. It’s also less dry, a little doughier. But it has that same buttery biscuit flavor. Unless you’re just trying to be more accessible to more people or you don’t have access to JF, I can’t think of a reason to reach for INW Biscuit when JF Biscuit exists.I do not get any coconut from this at 2%, which is a full flavored vape, but I’m aware that there are people who do.

I need it for an old favorite, Shyndo’s Mint Chip Cookies and Cream, and half a dozen things I’ve already planned to mix. Also:

[Fiddys LMP](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/214763-fiddys_lmp__lemon_meringue). If you want lemon meringue pie, this one looks perfect. **TASK 8**

[Badge Lemon Cookies](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/152038-diy_badge_lemon_cookies). Half of the recipes I already planned to try involve lemon mixed with JF Biscuit. Here’s another that looks great. **TASK 9**

[Strawberry Newton](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/237141-strawberry_newton). Stoked to find out what the combination of OoO Strawberry Jam and VT Red Dates tastes like! **TASK 10**

[Cocoliconut Cream Pie](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/234051-cocoliconut_cream_pie). Black licorice-infused coconut cream pie? That’s deeply weird but gotta try it. **TASK 11**

**Blueberry**

Sweet and very natural full-bodied blueberry flavor with just a hint of gym socks. Sounds terrible but I think it should replace FA Bilberry, which is often used to make more artificial, candyish blueberry flavors more well-rounded and realistic. Both are thick, full-bodied natural blueberries. FA Bilberry usually gets pretty gnarly with that sweaty sock flavor it has going on at a much lower concentration than JF Blueberry. That’s why I think JF Blueberry would probably be better than FA Bilberry to be used in the same way, because it’s so similar yet much sweeter, a little fuller, and less gym socky.

[Deep Blue](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/228746-developed2banger_deepblue). Just two flavors, the other one is FLV Milk & Honey. Interesting pair. **TASK 12**

[Blueberry Iced Tea](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/162049-blueberry_iced_tea). Looks terrific and refreshing. **TASK 13**

**Boysenberry**

Terrible, easily the worst boysenberry flavor I’ve tried. It tastes like an under-ripe peach. Doesn’t even taste like boysenberry, just a terrible, crunchy, greenish, juiceless peach, with a touch of indistinct berry on the end there. **TRASH 1**

**Burley Tobacco**

It’s an earthy, somewhat woody, light brown tobacco. It has a little brown sugar. It’s not incredibly sweet, but it has a notable sweetness that tastes very brown sugary. Tastes a bit more like cigarette tobacco than pipe or cigar to me. It reminds me a lot of FLV’s Mild Tobacco flavor, but less sweet and more woody than Mild Tobacco.

This is not a bad flavor, but there’s nothing I want to mix that uses it. **TRASH 2**

**Cactus**

This is a prickly pear flavor. It’s quite fruity. Specifically, it tastes watermelony to me. It’s kinda dry too, and the combination reminds me of watermelon bubblegum, like when you first put it in your mouth and it’s got that powdery outside. There’s a little green aloey taste covering it all like a blanket, too, as well as bits of other fruits, pear, maybe guava, maybe apple, it’s a mess. It does kind of taste like prickly pear fruit overall.

Again, not bad, but also not necessary. **TRASH 3**

**Cheesecake Graham Crust**

Nicely sweet and very clearly graham crusty, but not very rich or creamy, actually kind of airy where the cream cheese should be thick. Some of the cheesecake flavor is there, but it’s not a lot, and it’s not that rich. The crust is the star here. That crust has a good crunch to it, very accurate flavor, and I’m surprised that JF Cheesecake Graham Crust doesn’t get used more than TFA’s version for cheesecake - it’s so similar to TFA Cheesecake Graham Crust, but much more flavorful and authentic, a bit less meh, with a nice lingering sweet graham finish. I don’t get a coconut off-note from it but I wouldn’t be surprised if someone else did, pretty sure there’s some gamma octalone in here.

Here’s me doubling my number of great-looking recipes to try that use it:

[CV Ultimate Raspberry Cheesecake](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/284396-cv_ultimate_raspberry_cheesecake). Both the cheesecake and raspberry layers look excellent separately, definitely seems worth seeing how they fit together. **TASK 14**

[O’s Vanilla Pudding Pie](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/255282-os_vanilla_pudding_pie). Chocolate anything is pretty hard but it looks like a lot of work went into making this one just right. **TASK 15**

[Just Flaking Out](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/96154-just_flaking_out_). Such an interesting combination of flavors - CAP Cereal 27, JF Cheesecake Graham Crust, PUR Condensed Milk, WF Butter Pecan Pie, and the one that really sold it to me, VT Honeycomb. **TASK 16**

**Cherry**

Haven’t tried it yet. Don’t have high hopes; cherry flavors tend to be especially bad. But I’ll mix a 1% sample. **TASK 17**

**Churro**

Another one I haven’t tried. Will mix a sample at 2% **TASK 18**

**Coconut**

I get a ton of vanilla along with the coconut. It also tastes like real coconut though, I’m picturing real sweetened coconut flakes on top of a homemade vanilla whipped cream with lots of vanilla in it, or maybe since it’s not so separated and has that sweet creamy body, sweetened coconut cream or coconut milk with vanilla added to it. I like the way it tastes, but the vanilla could be a problem in a mix that’s not supposed to taste vanilla-y, because it’s pretty prominent.

I’ve got plenty of other coconuts, I don’t need this one. **TRASH 4**

**Coffee**

Like drinking watered down coffee in a nail salon. That unique smell. It tastes like that smell. There’s some coffee in there but it’s fairly light under all that nail salon flavor. **TRASH 5**

**Cookie**

I threw away FA Cookie because this is so extremely similar and yet slightly better. Seems to be a theme with Jungle Flavors being quite similar but a little better than something else that’s more readily available. It’s dark and kinda crunchy, but not burnt. Also buttery and not terribly dry. Sweet. A touch of an off note, but not a nasty one, just a little of something halfway between maple and caramel.

It’s used either in the original recipe or as a sub for FA Cookie in a bunch of things I’ve highlighted previously.

Here’s more sexy JF Cookie-using recipes:

[Cinnamon Topped Cake](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/293930-cinnamon_topped_cake) Looks like a delicious use of CAP Custard Cake. **TASK 17**

[mlNikon’s Autumn Cookies](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/242604-mlnikons_autumn_cookies) “Spiced cookies covered in a sweet candy shell” **TASK 18**

[Cookie Butter Custard Coco](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/243208-cookie_butter_custard_coco_). I haven’t had the cookies these are based on, but it looks like a recipe for buttery cream-filled cookies with a little dried coconut in the cookie dough. **TASK 19**

**Cookie Butter**

Another one I haven’t tried. Will mix a sample at 1%. **TASK 20**

**Cookie V2**

Haven’t tried, will mix a 2% sample. **TASK 21**
