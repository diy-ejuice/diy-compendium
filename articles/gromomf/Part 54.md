#INAWERA

**Cactus**

Tastes kinda weird, in my opinion, but nothing beats it in terms of adding the perception of wet juiciness to a recipe. I wish I knew how they did that.

It seems like the most common use for it is trying to harness as much of that wet juiciness as possible, while making the recipe taste as little of INW Cactus as possible. This usually means using it at 0.25 to 0.5%, but some recipes can take 1% and others need to be even lower than 0.25%. Anything over 1% and I can pretty much guarantee your recipe is going to be chock full of cactus flavor.

Which, again, is weird. It tastes kinda like aloe, but rather than one of those aloe juice drinks, it's more like treating your sunburn with some aloe-based medicine and accidentally getting some in your mouth. I wouldn't really call it medicinal in the way we usually mean medicinal, but it's just a weird, weird flavor. It's fruity, but I can't place the fruit exactly. Kinda of melony, but not really. It doesn't taste like prickly pear but it could be the fruit of some other cactus, I guess. It tastes more like prickly pear paddles than the fruit, kinda vegetal, but obviously not exactly like that either. A little floral upfront, especially at higher percentages.

But it's just so, so juicy. I think it does that by having something in it that literally has a mouthwatering effect. I wish I knew what it was, and we could use just that thing or combination of things as an additive.

I have a bunch of recipes that use Cactus already lined up. Here's a couple more, both of which use CAP Sweet Guava along with INW Cactus in different ways:

[Simply Prickly](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/279058-simply_prickly) - A very cactus-y recipe. **TASK 1**

[Skip Around the Guava](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/316332-skip_around_the_guava) - a guava-coconut custard with a touch of Cactus. **TASK 2**

**Cactus Lime**

So that's just INW Cactus with a touch of limeade-y lime. As a single flavor, it beats INW Cactus, because that little touch of limeade-y lime is more interesting and pleasant. It's a really nice pairing, though I would like it to be better balanced with more lime.

But the bottom line and reason I don't think its existence is really justified, is that if you wanted to make your own INW Cactus-Lime you could just mix INW Cactus with the lime of your choice and it would likely be better than this. There's nothing really wrong with the lime, it's just a little soft and mediocre.

There isn't anything I desperately want to mix that uses it. **TRASH 1**

**Cake Emperor**

At inaweraflavours.com: “Cheesecake with a noticeable fruity taste.”

At Inawerawinkle.com you get this much less helpful and more WTF description: “Here comes his majesty: the king of all cakes, desserts, emperor of total taste. Many a vaper bows in front of the majesty. They surround his enlighted sweetness and majestic fruitness. It is an absolute ruler of dessert flavours. Long live HIS EMPEROR'S HIGHNESS!” If you manage to read all of that verbal diarrhea without closing your browser and taking a walk to clear your head, it gives a suggested dosage then goes on to claim that the “main flavoursome notes” are “blueberry-plums cake with a touch of honey.”

I don't really get blueberry from this or even a clear honey flavor, but it does have a very plum-like top note, with some indistinct, earthy dark berry and honey-like sweetness behind it, on top of what tastes like that rich, Yes We Cheesecake flavor. Pretty tasty. There is a sort of plum or grape skin note in the middle that's a little weird, kind of tannic, but it's very light. Not entirely sure what to do with it but rather than the obvious cheesecake, Maybe and see what it does to a dark berry and cream profile.

Probably won't be keeping this one since it's not a very popular flavor, but before I toss it there's one thing I want to try.

Cheeba's [Berry Creamy](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/7840-berry_creamy) recipe is just 2% each FA Forest Fruit and TFA Marshmallow, plus 1% Flavorah Cream. I want to see what happens if I add 2% INW Cake Emperor to that. **TASK 3**

**Cappuccino**

Cappuccino powder before adding the hot water. It's thin, and quite a bit dry, almost powdery, but it does kind of taste like a cappuccino.The coffee is good and not super off, it's not too sweet, it's a little unbalanced with more of that dry milk taste but yeah, not gross and somewhat accurate. But, I don't have a use for it. **TRASH 2**

**Captain Jack for Pipe**

Smells like fruitcake-soaked in rum in the bottle, but vapes like rum-soaked fruitcake-flavored tobacco with bits of black licorice in it. I think I'd like rum-soaked fruitcake-flavored tobacco more without those anise notes. I'm good without it. **TRASH 3**

**Caramel**

This one was scary. It smells in the bottle like fermented molasses. It drips out of the bottle dark as used motor oil and suspiciously thick. It tastes kind of like the scorched sugar on top of a creme brulee, but not the whole sugar crust, just the very top, most scorched part, and maybe it was a little over-scorced? That's what I'd use it for if we didn't have any other of those types of flavors to play with. Since we do have those, I probably won't be using this for anything. FWIW, 1% is pretty light on flavor, tastes like it could easily go higher, but I didn't try it higher because nothing about the way this tastes made me want vape more of it. **TRASH 4**

**Cherimoya**

Mostly tastes like a porno involving a banana banging an overripe golden delicious apple, with a pineapple filming it. I can't remember who said this, but I remember someone called it “sweaty,” which.. Yes. It's sweaty. It's also kinda like baby food - banana, applesauce - with just a little splash of pineapple juice, all blended up. Has the thick, rich, creamy feel of a banana cream and some banana flavor but tastes more like apple, but not a tart green apple, more of a slightly funky yellow one, where it's ripe enough to have spots on it but still edible. There is some tartness there, but it tastes more like the tartness from a pineapple without a lot of pineapple flavor. It's less complex than others as these different elements - apple, banana, pineapple acidity - are more blended together into one thing - an overripe apple with the tartness from a pineapple, that feels like a banana, all mixed together. It seems like it would make it easier to work with, but from what I've seen it can take over a mix despite not having a very bold flavor, as both bananas and those yellow apples can be a little bland.

I need it for an old favorite, [Trop Cock](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/35505-trop_cock_strap_on). **TASK 4**

**Cherries**

Thin, light, top-heavy flavor with no body. No fleshy richness to it at all, light and airy. Sweet, but pretty dry. Needs additions to be a fuller, fleshed out cherry. Just adding more doesn't work, it gets too dry and starts to take on some harshness at 3%. And gets medicine-y - like Robotussin but a bit brighter - at 4%. Yes I know Counter Punch has it at 4% but you'd have to ask Alfred Pudding why that isn't terrible, I don't know.

Besides the aforementioned Counter Punch, I need INW Cherries for [Flawed Vacations in Spain](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/137141-flawed_vacations_in_spain_fizzy_sangria) and a couple of things I'm already planning to mix. Here's one more:

[mound thrasher](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/249472-mound_thrasher), described as a “dirty ol' peach forward mixed fruit soda.” **TASK 5**

**Cherry**

I need to let Foment Life talk about this one, because I wouldn't have thought it would be any good at 1% and he made it work beautifully in his Chase the Dragon recipe.

At 1% I get a tart yet dark, sort of wild cherry candy flavor, thick, deep, saturated, and sweet, with very little cough syrup and even less shower curtain, but the off notes are there. At 0.75% it's even less on the off notes, but they're still there, and the flavor has maybe a little less punch to it. It seems like it would take some skill, luck, or patience to cover those off notes up. Some combination of those things used have gone into FomentLife's [Chase the Dragon](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/146482-chase_the_dragon) because it really works there. **TASK 6**

Might as well try Foment's [Pink Pudding](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/185209-pink_pudding) while I'm at it, since he seems to know his way around INW Cherry. **TASK 7**

**Cherry Cigar**

It kinda tastes like one of those cherry cigarillos, but one where they actually put sweetener on the wrapper to make it extra sweet. It's so sweet, I would be a little surprised if I found out there wasn't any sucralose in there at all. The balance is weird. It's mostly cherry, a middle-of-the-road cherry that's on the darker side but not black cherry dark, like the cherry flavor in a cigarillo. The tobacco takes a backseat to that cherry. It's a drier cheap cigar-like tobacco, but a bit hay-like. It's not a Black & Mild Tobacco, it's on the lighter side and more like Extra Mild.

The cherry would be pretty great on it's own - no cough syrup or anything like that, but there's probably too much tobacco to get around it. At the same time, there's probably not enough tobacco for a good tobacco recipe, although there's nothing wrong with the tobacco that's there. But a lot of tobacco vapers don't like stuff to be so sweet and this is really, really like over the top sweet. Nothing I really want to make uses it. **TRASH 5**

**Chocolate Cream**

Some darker chocolate here, but mostly tastes like burnt creamy caramel sauce. Acrid. **TRASH 6**

**Coconut**

I don't don't want to waste too much time on INW Coconut because it's been reformulated and no longer exists. But while so many others suffer from being way too fake, this INW Coconut was much too realistic, to the point that they even included a fairly prominent dry, woody top note like a coconut husk. I do not want to eat, or vape, a coconut husk. There was a pretty straightforward natural coconut underneath but lots of husk. Hopefully the new one is better. **TRASH 7**

**Coconut Concentrate**

This is the new version, I haven't tried it yet. Will do a 1.5% sample. **TASK 8**

**Coconut Cookies**

Coconut-forward macaroon with a little toasty bakery in the background, with a hint of vanilla. If it were a little more thick and chewy textured and gritty at the same time, a bit sweeter, and had some meringue flavor, it would be a pretty accurate representation of those coconut macaroons that are just coconut flakes, sweetened condensed milk, whipped egg whites, and vanilla. Coconut isn't quite suntan oil, but does have kind of an oiliness to it. Could also work as a coconut accent to all kinds of bakeries. I couldn't find a recipe that convinced me to keep it. **TRASH 8**

**Coffee WG**

0.25% - Just badly burned coffee. Tastes almost like the smell of espresso spurting out of the top of a stovetop espresso maker and landing on a hot burner. So, pretty awful and burned, but not burned popcorn butter or skunk spray.

I have not tried the INW Coffee that's not WG, which is also called INW Kawa, but I hear it's pretty good. Of course, I don't entirely trust that, because no matter how awful a coffee flavor is, I can find someone who swears it's great (FA Dark Bean for example). **TRASH 9**

**Coffee Kawa**

I will try a 0.75% sample. **TASK 9**

**Creme Brulee**

This used to be perfect, but they reformulated it and ruined it and now it tastes like vomit. **TRASH 10**

**Cuban Cigar**

Tobacco that's a little sweet, a little loamy, has some nice depth to it, doesn't really do the full range of aromas I'd say is necessary to be called Cuban Cigar, but ok. Definitely worth having just to be able to make Brigade 2506 and None More Black by CBV. It's in a couple of recipes I've planned to try, including one added just last week. Here's another:

[Strawberry Blondie](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/73314-strawberry_blondie). **TASK 10**

**Custard**

Doesn't require a steep to be good, medium thick, and rich. Creamy, full mouthfeel. It's eggy but not really buttery and definitely not oily like CAP VC. It's sweet and has a very light warm vanilla undercurrent. Also get the barest hint of something darker, like caramel or cookie. This, mixed with FA Custard Premium to bring in the butter and even more richness, as well as a well rounded but still not overbearing vanilla... perfect.

It's used in a handful of my favorite recipes and countless recipes I plan to try.

Here's more:

[SCT](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/94290-sct__not_just_another_sc) - a strawberry tobacco by Fear for me to compare to the CBV strawberry tobacco I just added. **TASK 11**

[Strawber-RY4](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/79933-strawberry4) - another strawberry tobacco to compare to those. **TASK 12**
