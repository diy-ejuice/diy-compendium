TASK OR TRASH - Each flavor gets assigned at least one task or it goes in the trash.

_This was the rest of Part 26. Character limit cut me off_

## FLAVORAH

**Basil**

Strong, accurate sweet basil. Slightly minty, slightly peppery, some anise-like flavor, clean, fresh to the point of being leafy.

I loved [Pinalbohaca Ice Cream](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/45140#pinalbohaca_ice_cream_by_mlnikon) more than five years ago, before TFA VBIC started tasting peppery to me. Maybe I'll like [another pineapple-basil recipe](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/214291#jinnosuke_by_wolfwheeler) just as much. **TASK 1**

I feel obligated to try this [Gin Basil Smash](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/52522#gin_basil_smash_by_besejuiced) too, because I have FM Gin in Paris and not many people do. **TASK 2**

**Beer Nuts**

I feel silly pointing this out, but just in case anyone sees beer and thinks WTF: Beer nuts has nothing to do with beer except that they're often eaten while people are drinking beer. It's actually the brand name of a snack company that has a lot of salty snacks and probably their most popular is just a bag of mixed salted nuts, like you find free for the taking in a bowl at a bar.

The flavor itself is one of a precious few legitimately salty flavors I have tried, and it gives me hope that one day there might be a salt additive that opens all kinds of possibilities in mixing. I think this works as a salt additive as is, but only for nuts, as the salt here can't be divorced from a strong mixed nut flavor. It starts out tasting like roasted redskin peanuts, sharp and kind of intense, really salty, just right out front with the saltiness, and kind of crunchy, and then mellows out into a sweeter almond-like flavor that's a bit creamier. Has a dense body that trails off and then a lingering salty-sweetness. Highly concentrated flavor, 1% is a lot and it has some throat hit to it which is not surprising considering it tastes salty. I would start adding this at 0.25% or maybe even less and work up, in just about anything that's supposed to be nutty and salty.

I've yet to try a recipe I need this for. But one of these might change that:

[Red Honey](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/211070#red_honey_by_jakinbox) looks AMAZING. **TASK 3**

Payday is what this single flavor makes me want to mix up, seeing this [Salty Brine](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/252541#salty_brine_by_rocky02852) recipe was made by a Payday lover makes me want to try it. **TASK 4**

Adding [The Nut Sack](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/298733#the_nut_sack_mwc_best_recipe_by_rocky02852) because sugarchoc said so. **TASK 4.5**

**Berry Blend**

Fairly solid and unique mixed berry flavor, but a softer type of flavor, not especially juicy-feeling, with a light floral edge. It tastes a lot like FLV Boysenberry mixed with some brighter red raspberry flavor and the bit of realistic tartness that brings along. Slight floral edge attached to that thinner raspberry on top. Base is thicker, sweeter, jammy and indistinguishable from FLV Boysenberry, then it gives you a hit of blueberry right on the end. Definitely a jammy fruit rather than a fresh or candied one. 3% brings out too much floral, keep at 2% or below.

I need to hang on to it a bit for at least one recipe already on the task list. I'll try [22 Questions](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/165345#22_questions_by_strong_island_remix_flavorah_by_fadedjay1) as well, because grape-berry lemonade sounds great. **TASK 5**

[Le Grand Bleu](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/185245#le_grand_bleu_by_vensyboy), too, because I'm making a point to try blue razz recipes. **TASK 6**

**Berry Cheesecake**

The berry part is a nondescript berry that's kind of tart. If I had to give it a name I'd say it's somewhat like a blackberry-blueberry, but it's definitely not exactly that. The cheesecake filling is sweet and cream cheese flavored but not very rich, and there's not any crust here really. Berry flavor is very much on top of the cheesecake, not blended into it, which makes for an interesting contrast. It tastes like this might be useful in all kinds of berry + cream/custard applications but it will need help in every area to actually be a berry cheesecake, some sweeter more syrupy fruit so it's not all tart and borderline floral, some richness to the cheesecake filling, and some sort of crust. Don't do 2%, the berries go from slightly floral to full on perfumy fast. Nothing I want to make out of it, no reason to keep it. **TRASH 1**

**Biscotti**

This is kinda weird. It's normal to dip biscotti in coffee, but kind of weird that FLV has already done that for you. This is primarily a coffee flavor, but there's a little bit of sweet but very dry cookie in the middle of all this dark roasted coffee. Not quite a burned coffee, but a very dark bitter roast in the top notes and a sweeter coffee finish. The dryness on top is a bit unpleasantly harsh to my baby throat. There's some butter flavor here in the cookie but it's not the same as that popcorn butter flavor I associate with bad coffee flavorings. I'd heard reports of caramel and anise in here but did not really get either of those at 0.25%. It also seemed under-flavored. At 0.5% - Much of the same, with a little hint of caramel almost in the finish (though the aftertaste is bitter coffee) and, anise, lots of very somewhat dark coffee, and some very dry biscotti, enough that the whole thing is dry and gritty and and a little harsh. It does taste like dryness could be softened with creams.

I love tiramisu, so I want to give the [Developed version](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/201304#tiramisu_developed_by_developed) of that profile a try. **TASK 7**

**Black Cherry**

Tastes like you were making homemade vanilla marshmallows and accidentally spilled a spoonful of cherry cough syrup and melted plastic into the mix. Compared to a lot of worse cherry flavors, it's not that offensive, though it tastes like it would be more offensive if the vanilla marshmallow/medicinal plastic cherry ratio were more even, there's a lot of vanilla marshmallow here for a flavor called Black Cherry. So that's weird. Bit off topic but I highly recommend making homemade marshmallows. Messy, but way better than marshmallows from a plastic bag. **TRASH 2**

**Black Currant**

If I say it tastes like decaying carnations coated with just-add-water grape Kool-aid powder, that makes it sound terrible, but I don't think it is terrible, while at the same time I don't have a better way of succinctly describing it. It's a conundrum. It reminds me a lot of FLV Blackberry Blossom, but at the same time it's very different. It has a strong floral note, but it's funkier and more ripe and musky than the also musky, yet brighter floral tones in the Blackberry Blossom. The fruit is very dark and has a mixed berry vibe to it, like a grape-raspberry-blueberry but more grape than anything, but a really tart, candy grape, like drink mix with some citric acid involved. The sweetness in Blackberry Blossom tastes almost like a honey while this is more like straight sugar along with the mixed berry grape thing around that deeply musky floral heart.

I don't think I'm going to be keeping this, but I'll give it three recipes to change my mind.

[Black Lemonade](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/214950#black_lemonade_by_nickevz). Nick rarely disappoints. **TASK 8**

[Pink Pop](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/142003#pink_pop_by_sixstrings952). Citrus soda with boysenberry and black currant accents. **TASK 9**

[Mango Blackcurrant Pineapple](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/200086#flavorah_mango_black_currant_pineapple_by_rug_ly). Mostly mango, which works for me, with some really interesting accents. **TASK 10**

**Black Tea**

I get a floral edge on this one that might make it the best choice for a floral black tea but not much good outside of a floral tea. It's full bodied and slightly sweet and mostly tastes like a solid black tea. That floral edge is mostly undefined like you could bend it however you want with another floral, but it leans a little toward rose. Like a warm cup of slightly sweetened black tea with a rose petal or two floating in it. It's not a particularly perfumey floral, or at least it doesn't taste as perfumy up against a strong black tea as it might up against a fruit or something.

This is another one that I don't think will be sticking around, but once again, three chances:

[Jupiter Swirl](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/96787#jupiter_swirl_by_lonesomerhodestn). I love those coconut milk + condensed milk teas. **TASK 11**

[Little Bit of Paradise Tea](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/93605#exclusivegirl_s_little_bit_of_paradise_tea_mixinvixens_by_exclusivegirl). Pretty skeptical about FLV Black Tea being the best tea flavor for the job, but a tea with CAP Hibiscus and FE Lychee in it? Hard to pass up. **TASK 12**

[Iced Mango Tea](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/202220#iced_mango_tea_by_ebc88). Not sure I know how to say no to mango iced tea. Having it on your menu is one sure way to get me to order something other than water or alcoholic beverages. **TASK 13**

**Blackberry**

Super jammy sweet very dark berry. I'm not sure I would call it 100% blackberry in a blind taste test, but it's definitely a very dark berry and more like blackberry than any other berry. I also get notes of blueberry, purple grape, and black currant in there, like it would work as a component in a recipe highlighting any of those. Tastes natural, not candy, like jam. And unlike most other blackberries, it's not at all floral, which is awesome. There's a slight funky ripe or musky aspect to it that makes it taste more natural.

I'm surprised there aren't more recipes out there using this that I can and want to mix, but I did see a couple I'm excited to try:

[Spark - Berry Energy Drink](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/223208#spark_berry_energy_drink_by_tesladelmar) **TASK 14**

[Deep South Limeade](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/250732#deep_south_limeade_by_cam9535) Daniel approves, and I'm choosing limeade over lemonade 9/10 times if given the option. **TASK 15**

**Blackberry Blossom**

I feel like this might be one of those flavors where you gotta respect the hustle. I can just sort of imagine them trying to create a blackberry flavor and it just keeps coming out tasting very floral until they finally give up on blackberry and call it blackberry blossom. Or maybe they were going for blackberry blossom all along and nailed it, I don't know what blackberry blossoms taste like. But, it's not a perfumy floral at all. It's a very earthy floral like damp wildflowers, balanced with a dark berry with a dark, honey-like sweetness. There's a fairly funky raisiny musk to it as well that tastes quite a bit like FLV Fig. Really the whole thing tastes like FLV Honey Bee, FLV Fig, FLV Boysenberry all mixed together. It's a weird flavor, in other words, but at least it's very flavorful and interesting and not just another blah flavor.

It's in the Iceberry Lemonade recipe I've already tasked myself with under Alpine Strawberry. I was shocked to not see it mixed with tobacco anywhere on ATF, it really tastes to me like it would be excellent with the right blend of tobaccos.

Blacco V1 **TASK 15**

All FLV

| Flavor             | %    |
| ------------------ | ---- |
| Blackberry Blossom | 1    |
| Cured Tobacco      | 1.5  |
| Red Burley         | 0.75 |

If you're pretty sure you have a better combination of tobaccos to mix with FLV Blackberry Blossom, I would love to hear it, otherwise I'm just throwing it in with some old reliable and seeing what happens.

**Blood Orange**

Very specifically blood orange. It is the bloodiest blood orange, the one that tastes to me the most like blood orange versus all the other blood orange flavors. Natural blood orange with that earthy depth and red sweetness that really exemplifies the difference between a blood orange and a navel orange or mandarin. Not candy. Fleshy body, not waxy. 2%. Unfortunately not juicy. Mix with juicier fruits to avoid it getting too dry.

I've tried a bunch of recipes that used FLV Blood Orange, my favorite being a variation of Fear's [Bloody Mango Sorbet](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/55649#bloody_mango_sorbet_by_fear). Most of them were very good. But none of them were things I feel like I just have to be able to make again. At the same time, none of them made me think there will never be an essential FLV Blood Orange recipe. The only sensible course of action, then, is to try more FLV Blood Orange recipes.

[1 2 3 Orange Cream Cookie](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/122440#1_2_3_orange_cream_cookie_by_joeroots). Can it really be that easy? **TASK 16**

[1 2 3 Time for Vegas Baby](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/126320#1_2_3_it_s_time_for_vegas_baby_orange_vanilla_cream_by_chrisdvr1) I doubt it's going to blow me away but I bet it's pretty tasty. **TASK 17**

[Charizard](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/249450#charizard_red_yellow_orange_fruit_blend_by_danielthevapeman) .. Interesting.... **TASK 18**

[Hawaiian Hammer](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/264174#hawaiian_hammer_by_capiadiy). HOLY CRAP THAT LOOKS AMAZING. Pineapple, coconut, banana, orange. Probably tastes like half non-alcoholic pina colada, half Dole orange banana drink. Yes please! **TASK 19**

**Blue Raz**

Until this dropped, I thought it was strange that FLV didn't have a Blue Raspberry. Everyone has a Blue Raspberry. This one is a different sort of blue raspberry compared to most, sometimes I think they're just a bunch of hipsters over there at FLV trying to be different for different sakes. It's sweet and deep, thick and almost rich in a way, like a mouthful of blue razz gummy bear after it's been mostly chewed. Base-y. Doesn't go floral or grassy or soapy like too many other blue raspberry flavors, but does seem to be missing the more punchy tart/sour high notes like I'd want a perfect blue raspberry flavor to have. I'd use it to fill in the base of a more top-heavy candy raspberry, or tart it up a notch with a touch of lemon or maybe Sour Apple. It seems like a tool that was missing from my collection until now. 3% is great, or as great as it gets, 4% starts to get a little strange/funky in that currant/gooseberry not candy kind of way. I am about to mix a whole bunch of Blue Raz recipes.

[Triple Blue Bang](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/241236#blue_triple_bang_by_gabe8986), possibly too much LB Blue Razz for my taste, but will give it a shot. **TASK 20**

[Blue Enigma](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/264425#blue_enigma_by_cam9535) Looks like it checks all the boxes. **TASK 21**

[Pucker Up Blue Raz Candy](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/221460#pucker_up_blue_raz_candy_by_humanpuck) Looks like it checks all boxes and then some. **TASK 22**

[Electric Blue Lemon Ice](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/222570#electric_blue_lemon_ice_by_slushy). What's better than blue raspberry? Cold blue raspberry. **TASK 23**

[Blue Raspberry Taffy](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/222112#blue_raspberry_taffy_by_nickevz). Reading that list of ingredients like stop, I can only get so erect. **TASK 24**

[Blue Cacti](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/244755#blue_cacti_by_danielthevapeman). I can't imagine this tasting like anything but slightly blue INW Cactus, but apparently it's like blue razz tea. I'll see. **TASK 25**

**Blueberry**

This one's kind of a mess. It tastes like a grape, blueberry, raspberry blend. It doesn't even taste blue, it tastes kind of pinkish purple. The grape here is 100% grape soda, but there's also definitely some artificial blueberry in there as well, it tastes like the blueberry flavor added to cheap blueberry wine, and yet the top notes have a bit of a floral edge on them like a natural raspberry. So the whole thing is a bit of an odd mess, like half grape soda, half blueberry wine, with raspberries floating in it. I'm sure people can find some great uses for this weird flavor, maybe filling in a grape soda or grape candy recipe, I don't know. It's very weird. This [DEW ME BABY](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/269028#dew_me_baby_by_jay2kob) recipe is a little tempting, I'm sure it's not bad and it looks like the right way to use FLV Blueberry to me, but the number of tasks this week is getting out of hand. Also the mixer specifically asked for feedback on how to make it more authentic to the profile, but the profile is Mt. Dew Voltage and I can't help with that, never tried the stuff. I'm just gonna **TRASH 3** this flavor.

**Blueberry Muffin**

There's no muffin here. There's a very close approximation of what a cooked blueberry taste like, maybe just a hair short on the sugary sweetness, the kind of thing you can easily fix with some sweetener or brown sugar type of flavor, but otherwise the most accurate cooked blueberry stolen from inside a baked good by far. Like you can even get where the goo has leaked out of the blueberry into the muffin or pancake. There's no off-notes or anything like that, the off-note that it is called muffin and there's not a muffin here. It's only half of a blueberry muffin flavor. They sold us the other half when they came out with Lembas Bread later. It's a racket, I'm telling you, a scam to get you to buy two flavors to get a blueberry muffin instead of just one.

I feel like I tried a lot of recipes that used FLV Blueberry Muffin and all of them were good but none were desert island good. This one looks like it might be, though: [Southern Baked Folkberry Cobbler](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/233802#southern_baked_folkberry_cobbler_you_vote_we_mix_developed_by_developed) **TASK 26**

**Bourbon**

Absolutely yes. Tastes like Bourbon. Doesn't quite get there on the sweetness, doesn't quite get there on the alcohol kick, but absolutely nails that charred oak barrel flavor and also has a little body to it, so it's not just thin and top heavy like a lot of liquor flavors.

It's an indispensable component of my [Bourbon Trinity](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/186048#id10_t_s_bourbon_trinity_by_diy_discord). As seen in [The Back Nine](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/122659#the_back_nine_by_id10_t), which I want some more of **TASK 27**

I also love Tam's [Wild Horses](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/131078#wild_horses_by_tamvapes) and if you like both Bourbon and tobacco, you probably will too. **TASK 28**

I'm sad that I don't need it for [Bour-BAM!](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/58051#bour_bam_by_id10_t) anymore, but that was before LB Vanilla Ice Cream started tasting peppery to me. I'm going to try to remix that using my own [1-2-3 VIC](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/215957#1_2_3_vic_by_id10_t) vanilla ice cream base and see if it will still work.

Bour-BAM! ‘23 V1 **TASK 29**

| Co. | Flavor              | %   |
| --- | ------------------- | --- |
| FLV | Bourbon             | 0.5 |
| JF  | Dulce de Leche      | 2   |
| WF  | Vanilla Ice Cream   | 3   |
| TFA | Vanilla Swirl       | 2   |
| SSA | Ice Cream Vanilla   | 1   |
| TFA | Kentucky Bourbon    | 3   |
| TFA | Toasted Marshmallow | 1   |

And if it doesn't, maybe this [Delectable Bourbon Custard](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/280248#delectable_bourbon_custard_by_canadianvapor) will fill the gap left in my list of favorite recipes left by Bour-BAM! **TASK 30**

[Bourbon Coconut Custard](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/207528#bourbon_coconut_custard_allflv_by_dixxleroo) also looks very nice. **TASK 31**

**Boysenberry**

Is this the “best” boysenberry? It's certainly the most popular and has been used to create some amazing things, so I'm going to go with yes. It's a sweet, dark, jammy berry with some of the tartness of raspberry but not the sharp brightness of raspberry, none of the more aggressive floral tones that a lot of blackberry & raspberry flavors have. Dark, but not as deep and dark as a blackberry. It's a very interesting ingredient in that it isn't a very strong, punch you in the face flavor as a standalone, but even a small amount of it really makes a difference in a mix. Just a touch of sweet-tart at 0.25%, fuller berry flavor at 1%, maximum jammy sweetness at 3%. Starts to get a little floral/medicine at 4%, seems to top out at 3% in an average sub-ohm setup.

FLV Boysenberry makes an appearance in a large number of the recipes I'm already going to mix. Adding a couple more:

[Black Lotus](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/177568#black_lotus_by_horsegame). Y'all. I have no idea who horsegame is, I promise he or she or they are not paying me to say this, but I think this mixer might be a genius. Look at that. LOOK AT IT! Read the reviews. I can't wait to try that. **TASK 32**

[Burgundy](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/168231#burgundy_by_diydownunderpippa) Berry vanilla cream soda. You have my attention. **TASK 33**

**Brie Cheese**

I like the thick creamy body with that tangy cheesiness, especially if it's being cut into by a citrus or a tart berry like cranberry. I really think it tastes as much like cream cheese as brie, it's sort of in the middle there, not as innocent as cream cheese but not as funky as brie. It's not a bad flavor, and I'm really surprised to not see it used more often (at like 0.15 to 0.2%, it's extremely potent) in cheesecakes and such. But I'm dismayed by how few flavors I've gotten rid of so far this round, so I'm just going to let it go. **TRASH 4**

**Brulee**

So, that's not gross, but it's not creme brulee and it's a bit weird. It's definitely caramelized sugar but it's not hard and crusty, it's sort of fluffy, like a “toasted caramel cereal marshmallow” if such a thing existed. There's also something a little sour in there, not like dairy or yogurt sour, but more like a fruity tartness. Very slight custard flavor, no smooth buttery eggy custard creaminess, and overall dry like their regular Custard (as opposed to their Vanilla Custard and Vanilla Pudding which are awesome). Think instant custard powder still in powdered form. The whole thing is really sort of a hot mess, not the kind of hot mess that makes you want to puke but the kind that makes you just sort of scratch your head like “huh, well, uh.. Ok.” Not really sure what to do with this, mostly because that bit of tartness upfront is so weird. Probably the only thing I would do with it is play with mixing it with tobaccos, but I didn't see any recipes doing that and I don't care enough about finding a use for it to do that myself. **TRASH 5**

**Brut Bubble Wine**

Excellent sparkling wine flavor. Maybe a little too sweet to be called “Brut” but still. Fairly effervescent. Notably dry, not in the dry champagne sense, but it leaves my mouth dry. I think that's a function of whatever makes it seem a bit bubbly. Slightly boozy. Bit of an apple off-note, if you can even call tasting a little apple juice as an off-note. Bit bubblegummy if used too high. Not strongly, but it just gets a slight undercurrent of pink bubblegum at 2%, keep it below that.

I need it to make more [Blueberry Champagne](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/155904#blueberry_champagne_developed_by_developed), one of my all-time faves. **TASK 34**

**Bubble Gum**

Very accurate, sharper pink bubblegum top note, but not a lot of it, and a very dry, dense, appropriate sweet but mostly flavorless base. I have no qualms about using this to add a bit of bubblegum to something, nor about trying to cover up the pink part with a strong top-heavy fruit. Also seems like it will require a wet addition to get that mouthwatering effect of good bubblegum. Otherwise it tastes like baseball card gum or maybe Dubble Bubble, or some other chalky, cheap gum... certainly not Bubblicious or Hubba Bubba. 3% was a mistake. The dryness gets really harsh up that high. 1% is also too light, there seems to be a window with this one between 1.5 and 2.5 or so.

I'm much more inclined to choose MB American Bubble Gum or INW Bubble Gum (yc) over this one, but I need it to make another of my all-time favorite recipes, [HoneyMelon Bubblegum](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/35898#honeymelon_bubble_gum_by_jbird). FLV's Bubble Gum and Wild Melon are just so good together! **TASK 35**

**Butterscotch**

Sweet buttery delicious real butterscotch sauce with a hint of butterscotch candy in the top note. Deep buttery note and good body, dark caramelized brown sugar sticky sweetness, but a little dry and not as creamy as I want it to be. Slightly astringent or acrid molassesy off note, but not very obtrusive. There are better butterscotch flavors, but that hasn't stopped some people from making awesome stuff out of it. Most notably, as best I can recall, [Jacked Up Sundae](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/140386#jacked_up_sundae_by_tamvapes), which I can no longer enjoy because I gradually turned into a pepper taster, starting with a few TFA flavors (White Chocolate, Butter, VBIC, Vanilla Custard) and it spread to LB Vanilla Ice Cream.

I'm going all-tobacco on the recipes I want to try with this, all four of them look get-in-my-facehole-ish:

[ButteRY4](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/45290#buttery4_by_jenniferjarvis). **TASK 36**

[Classic](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/181182#classic_by_fadedjay1). **TASK 37**

[RY 4 Flavorah](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/161464#ry_4_flavorah_by_tamvapes) **TASK 38**

And [Hippy's Gold Reserve V3](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/289237#hippy_s_gold_reserve_v3_by_hippyvapes66). **TASK 39**

_Dammit, Flavorah. Really messing up my task-to-trash ratio here_

New Flavor Count: 2600
