TASK OR TRASH - Each flavor gets assigned at least one task or it goes in the trash.

## GET SUCKERED

### Anise

It tastes like holiday spice ice cream with a hint of anise and a touch of grease. Dry spice that tastes like a mix between nutmeg and cinnamon with touches of anise and clove, on top of a rich, sweet vanilla cream with an oddly greasy finish. The anise actually tastes out of place here, like it doesn’t belong in this holiday spice cream. **TRASH 1**

### Boysenberry

Haven’t tried this. I’ll mix a sample at 3%. **TASK 1**

### Macadamia Nut

Fucking Terrible. It tastes like you roasted nuts by sitting them on top of a leaky engine and driving around. There’s some weirdly artificial nut flavor that’s strongly accented with a taste almost spot on to the smell of an engine that’s smoking from an oil leak. **TRASH 2**

### Natural Pickle

Have not tried, but am in the market for a pickle flavor that’s better than One-on-One’s. Will do a 3% sample. **TASK 2**

### Plum

Another one that’s still unopened. Will do a 3% sample. **TASK 3**

## GREAT LAKES

### Bavarian Cream

If I’ve tried this, I don’t remember it. Sample time, 4%. **TASK 4**

### Cherry

I bought this to try someone’s recipe after being told Great Lakes cherry wasn’t plasticky at all. The recipe unfortunately was plasticky. But, that could have been caused by another flavor in the mix, so I’ll give GL Cherry a go standalone at 4% and see. **TASK 5**

## GREMBERRY FARMS

### Apple Pie

Decent, not great. There’s a lovely pie crust, but the cinnamon has a little metallic twinge to it and while the apple is ok, it’s on the weak side and doesn’t have a good balance with the crust, it’s more of a mediocre cinnamon crust with a little apple than a full-on apple pie. **TRASH 3**

### Caramel Spice

Don’t remember what this one tastes like, will do a 4% sample. **TASK 6**

### Chocolate Overload

Tootsie rolls, but worse. Tootsie rolls dissolved in a little Capri Sun, then dusted with a mixture of cocoa and dirt and served in a paper cup, cup and all. **TRASH 4**

### Cinn-Full Pear

It checks the boxes for essentially tasting as described, “Crisp Pear with Cinnamon & Graham,” and isn’t terrible, but it also tastes a little off all the way around, but especially in the cinnamon. I get a definite pear flavor from Cinn-Full Pear upfront, quickly intermingling with a spice note that’s clearly cinnamon but also not just cinnamon. It’s a strange and almost chemically tasting thing behind the cinnamon. Maybe nutmeg or clove, but I don’t know. I can’t identify it other than to say that the cinnamon is not quite right. Maybe it’s just that it’s definitely not FLV Rich Cinnamon, and I’m a spoiled baby. There’s a clear graham note under the weird cinnamon but it also has a bit of raw pastry dough taste. The base is rich and creamy, with some vanilla, a full coating mouthfeel, and a barely there coconut off-note. I like that base and finish a lot, if only it had a better cinnamon and bakery and maybe a better pear. **TRASH 5**

### Creamy Coconut

It tastes artificial, but not terribly weird, and also sweet and creamy, and the combination of features reminds me of a snow cone with added cream. Very flavorful. Definitely either a flavor pre-loaded with sucralose or some added sucralose in the Grimberry Farms Creamy Coconut. No weird off notes from it, it’s just a little strange to have blatantly fake coconut flavor mixed with cream, so it’s not coconut cream, it’s a coconut snow cone with cream. Some people might not like it because there’s a fine line between fake coconut and suntan lotion coconut but for me it’s not on the wrong side of that line. The snow cone might even be decorated with some real coconut flakes as there’s some natural coconut before the cream comes in. Has a thick, rich, coating heavy whipped cream kind of mouthfeel, with a sucralose sugar lips finish. Tempted to save it in case it turns out to be just the thing I need for a Tiger’s Blood recipe, but that’s the kind of temptation that leads to having to try to keep 3,000 flavors organized. **TRASH 6**

### Samoan Dreams

A good Girl Scout Samoa Cookie vape is something I would love, but this ain’t it. It just tastes like a burnt chocolate cookie with fake coconut flavor added to it, not a shortbread cookie with caramel and toasted coconut and chocolate. **TRASH 7**

### Vanilla Overload

Excellent flavor. I’ve been disappointed by some of the other Grimberry Farms things I’ve tried before, but not this one. Tastes like custardy rich vanilla ice cream with extra vanilla, topped with cotton candy and sprinkled with brown sugar. Nowhere the most buttery or eggy custard, but a little of both, definitely has a little DAAP going on. Very sweet. Some dryer caramelly brown sugar-ish taste to it upfront. Lots and lots of vanilla, layers of it, vanilla on vanilla, but mostly a deep, rich sort of French vanilla that’s bold and lingering throughout. Tons of body and weight to it. Grimberry Vanilla Overload reminds me a lot of TFA French Vanilla Deluxe, but the vanilla is less vanilla bean spicy than it is in that one, and the butter is less heavy. Complex. I can’t find any off notes in it, though that dryer, darker sweetness upfront keeps it from being perfectly smooth.Tastes like there’s a fair bit of ethyl maltol in here, that cotton candy sweetness that can get a little on the dry side. Still, Vanilla Overload does taste like something that would be amazing to add some FA Custard Premium to, to give it more of a wet buttery taste and feel. I do not think it’s a good sub for the original DIY Flavor Shack Holy Vanilla because that one is much darker and thinner, kind of spicy, more malty than brown sugary, and nowhere near this creamy. Vanilla Overload might make you say “HOLY VANILLA!” though. There’s not a recipe out I want to make that uses it and I’m not feeling creative this morning, but it’s tasty enough that I’m just going to mix a bottle of 5% standalone and enjoy it while thinking about what to do with it. **TASK 7**

### Winter Oak

It tastes like clove, nutmeg, cinnamon, orange peel, and raisins. Strong holiday spice flavor, bit of orange peel-like citrus. The spice mix is really forward and tastes like mostly clove, along with some nutmeg, and but not just nutmeg, also a touch of cinnamon and maybe some ginger. It reminds me of flavors like FLV Back Bar Bitters and INW Shisha Punch. They call it “a light tobacco with a smooth holiday-inspired spice mix.” It is smooth, especially for spices with a hint of citrus. I didn’t really get a clear tobacco, but the raisiny earthy mustiness to the smooth base is vaguely tobacco-ish. And I have no idea why Grimberry calls it “Winter oak” - I’m not getting any oak or wood from it.  

Like a lot of so-called tobacco flavors, it tastes like what this really needs is some tobacco. So I’ll give it some and see. Maybe the Winter Oak flavor needs some oak as well.

## Hangsen

### Apple Mix

It mostly tastes remarkably like that just-add-water apple cider powder stuff. Softer cooked-tasting sweet apple juice flavor, fairly bright but not hard-hitting. Just a touch of cinnamon in there and possibly another spice I can’t identify hanging around in its sweet and kind of powdery finish. People get some cranberry from this but what I get is more like just a bit of fruitiness and some added tartness than a clear cranberry flavor, coming in behind the apple cider. It’s a little thin and fairly dry, but not unpleasantly thin or dry, but dry enough that it would need some wet ingredients for a drinkable cider and dry enough that it shouldn’t make a bakery or tobacco soggy. Not a bad flavor, but there’s nothing I want to make that uses it. **TRASH 8**  

### Arabic Tobacco

More licorice and fruit than tobacco, like a licorice-coated fig, prune, raisin thing, very sweet. Imagine a black jelly bean with a raisin inside, like some kind of bizarro hellworld Raisinet. Tobacco flavor is present but very mild, just a light background flavor of grassy tobacco. 5% HS Arabic Tobacco also had a kind of yucky artificiality to the tobacco part, but 1.5% tastes about the same but without that fake tobacco character. People will find a use for this thing but just as a tobacco flavor, it’s pretty shitty.  I don’t need it. **TRASH 9**

### Australian Chocolate

Dark chocolate that’s a little oddly nutty and a little sour, but not awful. Like a Hershey’s Special Dark, but with some kind of indistinct roasted nuts in it. I don’t think it’s great by itself or as the only chocolate in a mix. I do like it used way low to boost with other chocolates, like around 0.25 to 0.5%. Any higher than that and that strange nuttiness sticks out too much for me, and over 1% it’s a much fuller flavor, but the sourness is off putting.

I’m still working on a version of my chocolate RY4 recipe that doesn’t depend on Baker Flavors Chocolate Truffle, and am not planning to use HS Australian in it either, but I might. In the meantime, this [Grey^ Burley](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/215417-grey_burley_a_beginner_bacco) looks good, I already know a little HS Australian Chocolate is great with FLV Red Burley. **TASK 9**

Already plan to mix [The Worlds End](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/306959-the_worlds_end_), a “banana bread with chocolate sauce” recipe. Might as well go ahead and add the updated version [The End](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/313489-the_end). **TASK 10**

I also have a “Chocolate Overdose Custard” recipe on the list, and there’s an updated version of that. [Chocolate Overdose Custard V2](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/298385-chocolate_overdose_custard_v2_) **TASK 11**

### Banana

Anything less than 2% is good, as you go up in % it starts to get both more candied and greener, which is an odd combination. At 1%, this is not a bold flavor, but it is a more realistic, very slightly creamy and mostly ripe but definitely not mushy banana, while still having that exaggerated artificial banana aspect. Top notes are similar to FA’s but less green, and it has more body than that one.

Super excited to try [Manana Soda](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/156275-ma%C3%B1ana_soda), a mango-banana soda by the soda guy himself, Staybert. **TASK 12**

Will also try [Fugly Butters](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/129193-fugly_butters). Yes, fried banana pudding is a real thing. **TASK 13**

### Blue Cola

Flat storebrand cola. It’s supposed to be Pepsi and it really is a little more pepsi-like in that it’s a more citrusy cola, not as spicy, dark, caramelly as a more Coke-like cola. It’s sweet and has a little body to it. Other than the flatness I really don’t get super anything weird or off with it, though the taste that lingers is, oddly, a little more bubblegum than pepsi. I don’t think that’s as much a problem with this flavor in particular as it is just a reminder of how much bubblegum and cola have in common, flavor-wise.

I don’t even like Pepsi. **TRASH 10**  

### Blueberry

Electric neon blue flavor. Not just artificial, but aggressively artificial. So aggressively artificial that it doesn’t even succeed in tasting like blueberry to me as much as it just tastes like almost violently bright blue in a bottle. Absolutely bold and saturated full flavor but tastes like something not found in nature. Maybe post-apocalypse blueberry glowing from radiation. Super fun flavor to play with, but more for experimental, abstract stuff than trying to emulate anything normal or natural.

Already planned to mix [Blue Mango](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/271992-blue_dreamblue_mango) and [Blue Balls](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/247884-blue_balls) - they look great. I’ll also try this [Shiny Mew](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/251826-shiny_mewaqua) recipe because I really like the idea of mixing HS Blueberry with WF Sour Blue Raspberry Candy, and adding 1% each of WF Hibiscus Candy and CAP Juicy Lemon to that is fascinating. **TASK 14**

### Butterscotch

Does not taste like butterscotch. It’s extremely buttery, but like fake movie theater popcorn butter rather than real butter. Thick, full, creamy, with a rich, coating mouthfeel. It also has a lot of caramel sweetness. The overall effect is like putting fake butter on unsalted caramel microwave popcorn and then just licking the fake butter and caramel off without eating the popcorn. **TRASH 11**

### Caramel

I think I’d like this one much more if I didn’t go into it with such high hopes for it. I expected great richness and creamyiness and because of how their ice creams are, but didn’t really get that. It seems to be weaker than average for a Hangsen flavor. At 1.5% I got a bit of a dry dark caramel/brown sugar flavor very much on top of a thin cream. Made another sample at 3% and it was much better, fuller flavor. The caramel and cream were still somewhat separate, but less disjointed; they meet in the middle a bit. But the caramel was too dark and still a bit dry, dry enough to have some scratchiness to it at first, and that cream finish was sweet and smooth and thick but wasn’t particularly milky, rich, or buttery. It’s also likely that it improves with a steep, I only tried the 3% sample with an overnight steep. But the 1.5% didn’t really change at all after 5 days, so I don’t know. And I don’t think I need this. **TRASH 12**

### Cheesecake

Have not tried. Will mix a 1% sample. **TASK 15**

### Chocolate Banana

It literally tastes like their Banana and their Australian Chocolate mixed together. That’s it. So the chocolate part is a little nutty and a little dry but not gross or weird or tootsie rollish like you’d expect from a lot of chocolates. But it’s also not chocolate syrup like a banana split. It seems like you could make a better chocolate covered banana with your own banana and chocolates, but if you just want chocolate and banana to be a component in something, this should do. Tasting it makes me want to mix a chocolate-banana tobacco recipe, but I can do that with other banana and chocolate flavors. **TRASH 13**

### Chocolate Cream

Not very chocolatey, but rich and creamy with an authentic dairy twang and a very light bit of chocolate without gross off notes. Needs more chocolate to be chocolate milk or milk chocolate, but seems like it could be a great component for either. On the other hand, there’s VT Devon Cream, which seems like it could do anything this could do, only better.  **TRASH 14**

### Cinnamon

Candy cinnamon without the candy sweetness. Kind of like Big Red gum, but not as sweet. Has some body to it but the body has a slight plasticky chemical note standalone behind the bright red not-sweet candy. Lingering spicy candy cinnamon. I’d use this as a candy cinnamon option or something like Big Red, Red Hots, or Hot Tamales, if I had to use Hangsen for some reason, but there are better options with nothing off. On the upside, it’s not too dry, and could work in a cinnamon schnapps kind of situation. Not so much Fireball Whiskey because that’s a little different spice note, but something like Goldschlager or Hot Damn in a cocktail mix. **TRASH 15**

### Coconut

There are a few coconut flavors that have a strange woody thing going on, and this is one of them. I don’t know if putting some coconut husk in there is a weird attempt at authenticity but someone needs to tell these flavor people that you don’t actually eat that part. It’s fairly mild in this one, though. Underneath is a thin and sweet coconut that tastes like something halfway between sweetened coconut milk and coconut water, without any other off notes. That husk though. Why? **TRASH 16**

### Cream

Extra heavy heavy cream with a lot of buttery richness. Tastes DAAPy with the butter but a little fake, like a bit of movie theater butter in the heavy cream, and a very slight cheesiness, not like a gross cheesiness but like a cream cheese. There’s also some sweetness to it but really no more than heavy cream has. 1% might have been too much. It’s also not especially smooth despite all that butter; it’s bottom heavy but a little dry on top. I’ll be fine without it. **TRASH 17**
