## GERMAN FLAVOUR

### Amarena Cherry

This one is unique. You know what a cherry amaretto sour is? It’s a cocktail I don’t like, but some people do. It’s just usually amaretto and sweet & sour mix with a maraschino cherry and some grenadine or some of the syrup from the cherry jar. This pretty much tastes like that. Lots of amaretto flavor, but some tart citrusy taste right on top and the cherry tastes a quite bit darker than the bright red maraschino. Like black cherry amaretto sour, maybe? It’s odd and has a baby powder finish like some of that WF Champagne Soda got in there. No cough syrup or shower curtain, though.  **TRASH 1**

### Birne

Candy pear and model glue. At 6% it’s mostly model glue. At 3% it’s a light flavor and with about a 50/50 split between candyish pear and model glue, the kind that comes in the little red tube that says “Cement For Models” on it and has a bunch of warnings on it about flammability and not safe to inhale fumes and crap like that. GF Birne is a bad, bad flavor. Unless you’ve always wanted to vape model glue, in which case, have at it, hoss. **TRASH 2**

### Birne Joghurt

This is literally un-vapable, easily one of the worst flavors that I have ever tried. The pear top note tastes as much like model glue as pear, really sharp and painfully offensive, and it’s piled on top of a pool of sweet creamy vomit. Usually even if something is terrible I can at least vape it dry enough to take the cotton out and rewick, with this stuff I could not make myself vape it dry. It’s that bad. **TRASH 3**  

### Black Cherry

Tastes like drinking cough syrup in a nail salon, where a vanilla candle is burning. Pretty typical medicine cherry, but instead of that new vinyl shower curtain liner taste, it’s a special kind of plasticky awfulness that’s a lot like nail salon fumes, and lots of it. There’s a touch of waxy vanilla as well but it doesn’t help, it just adds to the weirdness. **TRASH 4**

### Butter Spekulatius

Tastes like cloves and prunes. like stewed prunes with a bunch of clove. Tastes like it might be a good sauce for a holiday ham. Doesn’t taste anything like butter, Speculoos cookies, butter cookies, or cookie butter, or even anything in the same family of flavors as those. No bakery of any kind, just prunes and clove. It is very sweet and does have a real thick mouthfeel and tastes like someone who loves cloves might love it, but WTF. Why is it named this? **TRASH 5**

### Cherry

Tastes like artificial “wild cherry” flavoring that’s deep and sweet like a wild cherry lifesaver, juicy and saturated, but with light hints both new vinyl shower curtain off note and with that same weird ketchupy vibe that I get from TFA Raspberry Sweet. Maybe if those things could be covered up it would make a good wild cherry candy flavor in a mix? I mean, TFA Raspberry Sweet works sometimes, and this has redeeming qualities without being much worse. I don’t see a recipe I want to make with it, though, and am not in a pioneering mood this morning. **TRASH 6**

### Cherry Poppins

German Flavours claims it tastes just like fresh squeezed cherry juice. That’s BS. It tastes like someone made a cherry sucker recipe using a good cherry flavor and too much FW Hard Candy. You know that hairspray thing that FW Hard Candy does if you’re not super careful with it? This comes preloaded with that. On the upside, it tastes like sweet and sticky bright red cherry candy without shower curtain or cough medicine, but I’m not sure hairspray is better than those other than being a nice break from them when trying a bunch of cherry flavors. **TRASH 7**

### Cherry Yogurt

A lot of cherry flavors taste terrible but this is the only one I’ve tried that tasted like barf. There’s a small amount of a dark cherry-ish flavor that tastes fine, something like amaretto for whatever reason, and some sour, barfy chalky stuff in the finish. It’s not a super strong barf taste, but still, no vomit at all is better than a little vomit. **TRASH 8**

### Honig

Horrendous cat piss room note, not nearly as bad to vape as the smell that clings to a room would have you think, but still pretty nasty. Very sweet and syrupy, but enough of that cat pee flavor coming though to make it sickening. Not extremely floral, but the bit of flower flavor that’s there tastes more like chrysanthemum than clover or rose, which is kind of interesting. It tastes like it might work as a honey accent at a dilution level, maybe. But at 0.25% and steeped for 10 days it is still very strong and very bad. **TRASH 9**

### Mango

Perfumy, but in a natural way, the same kind of perfuminess that very under ripe mangos have. Mangoes should be soft, this is like a crunchy underripe mango, along with a good hit of that piney green rindy note and no juiciness, with only a little ripe fruit taste at the end of the vape. **TRASH 10**

### Nougat

This is pretty yummy. It doesn’t really taste like nougat, but it tastes like gooey honey caramel sauce with hazelnuts in it. That gooey sweet stuff is super tasty and interesting.The only flaw is that hazelnut has a bit of that “nut-skin” off note that some peanut flavors and other nut flavors have that sort-of ruins them. Although it’s light, that nut-skin top note is a bit of a turn-off. I wonder if it could be improved by adding some more hazelnut that tastes good to cover that a bit. I will try.

Hazelnut Caramel Test V1 **TASK 1**

FW | Hazelnut | 2

### Rum

Nail Polish. Just nail polish, with a little bit of a weird buttery undertone. **TRASH 11**

### RY4 Blend

Thin and dry, with an acrid burnt sugar inhale, slightly sweet-and-sour not tobacco but ashy/hay + caramel exhale with a very light nail polish note. This is definitely under-flavored at 4% but nothing about it put me in the mood to try mixing up a stronger concentration.  **TRASH 12**

### Sweet Cherry

Very weird. It’s a bright red cherry candy and it is sweet, but the most interesting or weird thing about it is that it’s also a bright red cinnamon candy. Seriously, it tastes like eating a cherry jolly rancher and a cinnamon jolly rancher at the same time. IDK WTF to do with this, but it’s worth noting that it’s a deep saturated flavor and I don’t get any shower curtain or cough drop from it. **TRASH 13**

### Whiskey

It’s like being served whiskey with cotton candy dissolved in it, in a dry erase marker dust-rimmed glass. Weird, has some whiskey taste but, there’s a lot of ethyl maltol in here, enough that it tastes like cotton candy. I’ve seen drinks made where the bartender dissolved cotton candy in liquor, don’t think they dissolved it in whiskey, but that’s what this one tastes like. And there’s an odd chemical off note as well that tastes like a dry erase board. **TRASH 14**
