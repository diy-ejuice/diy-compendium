TASK OR TRASH - Each flavor gets assigned at least one task or it goes in the trash.

## FLAVORAH

**Jackfruit**

Probably the most accurate natural-tasting jackfruit, also not my fave. It tastes like an overripe pineapple sandwich. No, really. Leave a pineapple ring out for a day or two until they turn brownish but are not yet rotting, stuff them into a yeast roll and chow down, that’s pretty much FLV Jackfruit.

It’s used in a recipe already on the task list, and one more caught my eye: [Yuji Itadoiri](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/227203#yuji_itadori_by_wolfwheeler). It’s a Belgian waffle with tropical toppings (pineapple, mango, coconut) and it looks like a perfect way to use FLV Jackfruit. **TASK 1**

**Jammy Berry**

That has jam written all over it and I’m much more confident in its ability to turn other fruits - at least berries, maybe not other fruits - into jams than I am of FA Jammy Wizard and especially VT Jam It. By itself, it tastes like a mixed dark berry or boysenberry-ish jam, very thick and sweet. Similar to FLV Boysenberry but darker and more jam-like. Syrupy sweetness but not candy except maybe jelly candy made with real fruit. Very ripe, cooked down blackberry primarily. There’s some raspberry to it but without the high floral-type tartness of a fresh raspberries. It has a clear blueberry note as well that fades after a short steep so it’s less clearly blueberry and more just very dark fruity sweetness. I guess that’s unfortunate if you love blueberry and were using it for that but not unfortunate if you want it to be more versatile. Seems like you could bend it into a specific berry jam or jelly pretty easily with just one flavor to pull it that way, even strawberry, though I don’t really taste strawberries in it. But especially raspberry, blackberry, or blueberry.

Jammy Berry is an ingredient in at least six things I already plan to mix, but to add just one more, [Jammy Roll Cake](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/251820#jammy_roll_cake_by_badluc), I know it’s going to be delicious. **TASK 2**

**Juniper Gin**

Mostly juniper flavor, and it was nice of them to warn us about that right in the name. But a bit more complex, there are some other aromatics going on in there including herbal notes, a floral bit that leans toward lavender, a hint of peppery spice, and a touch of citrus.

It’s a little sweeter than I’m looking for in a gin as a single flavor, but that might fade into a mix with other ingredients that are supposed to be sweet. Not dry, but not especially wet either. Doesn’t really have a boozy bite to it, which is unfortunate, should still work for a bit of gin in a cocktail, especially if that boozy business is coming from elsewhere. Smooth, not harsh at all, but a bit soft. The floral in this one runs a little detergent-y for me at 4%, but not at 2%, so I would keep it at 2% or lower. 0.25% appears to be just enough for a hint of that resiny juniper without going full gin or as full a gin as this gets. Tastes like it would be a super fun flavor to play with.

Already planning to mix the Dragon in The Pines and Pink Gin recipes that use it. I’ll add [Gin Soaked Balls](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/141294#gin_soaked_balls_by_jenniferjarvis) to the list, subbing FW Sweetener for the PUR Super Sweet that I don’t have. **TASK 3**

**Kentucky Blend**

Full bodied, rich tobacco that’s smooth overall but has some kick, with a bit of ash and a smaller bit of spice. Not too dark, but not especially bright either. I’m not great at describing tobaccos - especially good tobaccos that don’t have weird gross off-notes to point out - but I know I like it.

I need it for at least half a dozen recipes I love and at least half a dozen more that I already plan to try. To add even more:

[Smooth Blend](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/264583#smooth_blend_by_badboxer99) Maybe more tobacco-ish than tobacco, but looks satisfying AF. **TASK 4**

[Red Dragon Cartel](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/172313#red_dragon_cartel_by_slushy). Sweet rich-looking RY4. I’ll mix with FW Sweetener rather than PUR Super Sweet. **TASK 5**

[Hazelnut Tobacco](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/210135#hazelnut_tobacco_by_failyx). Looks like my German friend Felix has put together something really special, especially if you read the reviews. **TASK 6**

[Deez Nutz](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/194527#deez_nutz_by_slushy). Coconut RY4. **TASK 7**

[Old Man Porch](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/254801#old_man_porch_by_chumbles). Peanut Butter Coconut Tobacco. These are getting wilder. **TASK 8**

[Savannah Spring](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/213376#savannah_spring_by_dragonlady). That is a peach lemonade tobacco. WTF, but also, I gotta try that. **TASK 9**

**Kinako Soy**

It’s supposed to be dry roasted soybean powder. I’ve never tried the real thing so I don’t know for sure, but after reading some descriptions I’d say it’s probably pretty close. Right off the bat I thought of Reese’s Puffs cereal. If you could somehow delete the chocolate from Reese’s Puffs cereal and have only the peanut butter puffs. It’s similarly simultaneously toasty and nutty and grain-like. And sweet, it has an underlying dark, malty sweetness.

Necessary to mix more [Wild Horses](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/131078#wild_horses_by_tamvapes), and I want to try [Gyokko - Upper 5](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/271488#gyokko_upper_5_by_wolfwheeler), a pistachio ice cream in a waffle cone. Wolfwheeler really wants me to have to buy more SSA Crisp Waffle, apparently, or he wouldn’t keep putting it into so many delectable-looking recipes. **TASK 10**

**Kiwi**

**TRASH 1** No question, that does in the garbage. FLV Kiwi is definitely the worst kiwi out of all the ones I’ve ever tried (about two dozen of them). Even at just one drop per 10ml, it’s gross. I can’t believe someone even taste-tested this before releasing it. It tastes nothing like kiwi. It’s just this sweet, musky floral with a creamy-ish melony base like a cantaloupe. It also has a little of that cat pee/meth lab ammonia off-note like a few honey flavors have. It’s abysmal.

**Lembas Bread**

It’s just a plain muffin, with a little indistinct fruitiness to it. A little soft, missing some of the outer “crust” if you will of a muffin, but pretty spot on to the fluffy inside of the muffin. Could use some more butter, but there is a bit of butteriness to it. The fruitiness to this is mostly a very light, vague berry, but it is also a bit lemony, but no more lemony than the amount of lemon used to make a really good blueberry muffin. It’s probably bendable into whatever kind of fruity muffin you want - apple, banana, strawberry, orange cranberry - and of course blueberry, but probably not like a chocolate muffin. Or even a cinnamon muffin without any apple to soak up that fruitiness, but it would probably be great for a cinnamon apple muffin.

I dunno, the last time I tried a muffin recipe I thought, this is great, this mixer did a really good job, it really tastes like it should... but... why would I vape muffin when I could vape cake? It’s not like it has calories or I need the fiber or need to avoid the sugar. I’m sure the handful of muffin recipes that use it are solid recipes, but let me vape cake. With that in mind, I’m good without Lembas Bread. **TRASH 2**

**Lemon**

Weird combination of sweet candy lemon and actual tart lemon juice that seems disjointed, but I’ve had it work for splash of lemon juice in sweeter beverage vape at a fairly low %. Moderate throat hit bordering on harsh which I guess is what you’d expect from a lemon juice that really tastes like lemon juice up top. Seems like no matter what you’re trying to do, there’s a better lemon out there for the job. **TRASH 3**

**Lemon Grass**

Strong, super concentrated very weird mix of smooth and sweet almost-candy lemon and something earthy and weird. Weird is not always bad. Definitely do not recommend using it higher than 0.5%, but I like to vape it all by itself at 0.5%. Doesn’t actually taste grassy, it tastes more woody, I’ve heard it described as bamboo flavor and that sounds about right. It’s not thin; it’s very thick. It’s rich and almost but not quite buttery, kind of like a coconut richness, without the coconut taste.

I’m already planning on mixing a couple of recipes that use it, here’s another [Moro-No-Kimi](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/210996#moro_no_kimi_by_wolfwheeler) That is a milkshake IPA with passionfruit and it’ll probably be terrible but there’s only one way to find out. **TASK 11**

**Lemon Tea**

Tastes like hot tea with a lemon wedge in it and no sugar. It’s a little throaty at least for me, and if you push the concentration up too high it will get even more throaty and the lemon will get a little cleaning producty, but keep it around 1% to 1.5% and it’s an accurate cup of tea with lemon.

I need it for [The Back Nine](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/122659#the_back_nine_by_id10_t), an Arnold Palmer spiked with bourbon. **TASK 12**

It’s in one or two others I plan to try.

[Shaken Iced Hibiscus Tea](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/151758#shaken_iced_hibiscus_tea_by_nachef). It looks perfect. **TASK 13**

[Cam’s in the Hammock](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/309114#cam_s_in_the_hammock_by_cam9535). Very interested in that FA Raspberry + FA Mango Indian Special combo, and the large amount of TFA Sweet Tea with a small amount of FLV Lemon Tea is a proven winner. Mixer suggests adding 0.4% CAP Super Sweet and 0.25% WS-23 but didn’t include it in the recipe. I’m going to add both. **TASK 14**

**Lemonade**

Is an extremely nice flavor to vape, I love it. If I could only have one flavor with lemonade in the name, this would be it, this would be the one. But if we’re talking authenticity, tastes more like a lemon sucker than a lemonade. No actual lemons were harmed in the making of this flavor, but it’s not remotely pledgy either. Just a terrific artificial sweet lemon candy flavor. It’s very sweet and sugary and more dense than lemonade and not acidic enough even for a powered mix Country Time-type lemonade. Tastes like it could do very well just about any time you might want a sweet artificial lemon with just a little tartness, including a lemonade as long as lemonade is only part of the profile, really super versatile and relatively smooth for a citrus. It also has a little problem with fading, but so do many other lemon/lemonade flavors.

I need it for [Grunch](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/162546#grunch_by_kopel) and it’s already time to mix some more dat. **TASK 15**

It’s also in some other things I’m going to mix and now it’s in one more: [Sour Peach Melonade](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/245156#sour_peach_melonade_by_tesladelmar). **TASK 16**

**Lime**

Super potent. Lime jello laundry detergent over 1%. Get some sharp lime zest upfront but the exhale is dry soapy aggressively fake lime that reminds me of laundry detergent. At 1% and below, more of a zesty dry lime on top and a lime sushy syrup flavor without the syrupy texture or sweetness of that. Lime-jello like flavor but dry texture. Good supporting lime at half a percent or less for a lime candy/slush anything where the artifice is a plus rather than a minus.

I need it for Giant Swan and Kopel’s Ginger Beer, and it’s in some things on the list, I also want to try:

[Sticky Limeade](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/113447#saturdiy_sticky_limeade_by_concreteriver) **TASK 17**

**Lime Wedge**

Perfect full-on natural lime, has everything you’d want in a real lime. Harshness typical for citrus, not excessive. Tart juice, some sweet body, zest but not too much. PROBLEM: Fades very badly in a mix, almost to nothing after a week, leaves behind a bit of that citrus harshness that’s about it. I would do unspeakable things to get a version of this that doesn’t fade, but since it does, I don’t really need juice that can’t sit on the shelf until I get around to vaping it. **TRASH 4**

**Lovage Root**

I need it for [Southerner](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/58127#southerner_by_kopel) and am already looking forward to trying it in [The Hinterlander](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/46122#the_hinterlander_by_kopel). I guess I’ll try [Humbug](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/56741#humbug_by_chemicalburnvictim), too. **TASK 18**

**Lychee**

Way floral, tastes as much like a flower as a fruit. There is a sticky sweet syrupy sort of accurate white grapey base with a hint of tartness that does taste like a lychee, but the floral edge on it comes out swinging and is intense. It’s also off. White the other lychee flavors and actual lychee have a floral note that tastes kind of like a rose, this is more like some kind of mutant rose-elderflower thing. I actually like this flavor a lot, but I like florals. This does not taste like something someone who doesn’t like florals could enjoy, which isn’t true of all the lychees, I think.

I’m gonna mix [M4NCEE](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/260905#m4nchee_by_sgt_dryhit). That should have been added to the list last week when I was looking at recipes for FLV Cotton Candy, not sure how I managed to miss it. A mango-lychee blend. **TASK 19**

_My Goodness. I've gone through so much and planned to mix so many that I have to break this week into three parts instead of just two._ Will have Part 32 up in a jiffy.

New Flavor Count: 2571
