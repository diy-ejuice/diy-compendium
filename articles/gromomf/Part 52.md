TASK OR TRASH - Each flavor gets assigned at least one task or it goes in the trash.

#Health Cabin

**Malaysia Cantaloupe**

Same weird off note that's in HC Cantaloupe, I guess the folks at HC think cantaloupe has a little hair spray taste and should be a little scratchy on my throat. Come to think of it, HC Cantaloupe and HC Malaysia Cantaloupe taste almost identical. They might even be the same flavor, and the slight difference I noticed could be due to the age of the concentrates, and I just got this Malaysia Cantaloupe recently and I don't even remember where the HC Cantaloupe came from. The only difference is that the melon flavor is more intense and deeper and the syrupy sweet finish is sweeter, while the hairspray and throat hit are the same. **TRASH 1**

**Malaysian Mango**

Corn. Off all the off-notes in mango flavors, that is one I never expected. It tastes like there is sweet corn in there, along with a decent mango. It sounds kinda gross and it kinda is, but on the other hand, I've had mango salsa that had corn in it and that was perfectly fine. Corn. Right up front where other mangoes are usually citrusy or piney or both. It's the darnest thing. **TRASH 2**

**Maple Leaf**

Perfumy. Weak for HC, I had to push to 3% to get a full flavor out of it and at that point, it tastes like maple-scented perfume. **TRASH 3**

**Milk**

Metal vomit milk. It has a vomity taste to it but vomit is sour and this has a bitter edge to it, kind of metallic.I keep wanting to say alkaline but am not sure that is correct. But, like, if you tried to commit suicide by eating AA batteries, washed them down with buttermilk, and then had your stomach pumped, this would be that. **TRASH 4**

**Oatmeal Cookie**

That is foul. This nasty stuff lingered in my RDA and I had to rebuild and rewick after it. It tastes like you made oatmeal cookies with glue instead of flour and sugar, and then let mold grow on it. It has some toasted bakery flavor but there's also a strong taste of glue and a lingering disgusting mold flavor. **TRASH 5**

**Papaya**

Pukey papaya. It's clear they're using butyric acid to get that creamy rich funkiness of a fully ripened papaya. Some of the other papaya flavors do that as well, and make it work (see TFA Papaya), but this one seems to have gone overboard with it to the extent that it tastes very much like regurgitated papaya. Like you ate papaya, puked it up an hour later, and tried to vape that. It's otherwise pretty flavorful and authentic to a natural ripe papaya, nice and thick and sweet, so it might be something where there's an amount somewhere under 1% that works, or it maybe needs to steep longer than a week to be great, but my week-old sample of this tasted distinctively puked up and didn't mess with it any further. **TRASH 6**

**Peach**

Have not tried, will do a 0.5% sample. **TASK 1**

**Pomegranate**

Engine starting fluid off-note. I know that engine starting fluid aroma well, as my great-grandmother used it to put down weird bugs she'd find and then pin to a board. Yep, it reminded me of my amateur entomologist great-grandmother. Underneath that, some light cherry-grape-ish flavor, but that nasty weird chemical thing is dominant, and terrible. **TRASH 7**

**Pound Cake**

Tastes like vomited pound cake. This is infuriating because it tastes like it could be so good if it didn't have that vomit note. Possibly that steeps out eventually, but after one week, it tasted like pound cake that someone has eaten and then puked up. Ralph sits right on top and then comes back around and mingles with a sugary sweetness in the finish in a way that's nauseating. Aside from that, it's very thick and cakey, perfectly moist, and tastes almost exactly like a hunk of that pound cake you find at gas stations, complete with a touch of vanilla and the darker sugary crusty edge and even sweeter, grittier sugary finish. I didn't get any off-notes aside from the puke, but it's a fairly prominent puke flavor, not just a little hint of butyric. If you're not at all sensitive to butyric acid, you might want to give it a try. **TRASH 8**

**Pumpkin Pie**

I don't think anyone at Health Cabin has ever eaten a pumpkin pie. I just got mild harshness and waxy dry semisweet some kind of fruit maybe with a touch of not identifiable spice. Not pumpkin spice, not custardy pumpkin filling, no bakery notes. Not pumpkin pie, doesn't seem to get good for anything. Just not good. **TRASH 9**

**Ripe Mango**

Grotesquely overripe to the point of nastiness, and has some brighter nectarine-like notes for balance but that rotten base is foul. **TRASH 10**

**Salted Caramel**

This is actually sort-of salty, like FLV Beer Nuts is salty, but it mostly tastes like hot metal, like leaving a pan on the stove. There's an undercurrent of sweetness there but it's mostly just like burning metal. Probably also worth noting that the concentrate itself is jet black and even diluted to 1% the resulting juice is the color of dark chocolate even without steeping; that's not usually a good sign. **TRASH 11**

**Sour Cherry**

Not Bad! Sweet red candy cherry. It doesn't live up to the “sour” description, but it does have a little tartness to it. It's softer than I wish it was, I wish it had more punch to it, especially on top where the bit of tartness is, but it's got some depth and saturation, along with a sticky sweet candy cherry finish, and basically tastes just like a cherry lollipop. It has some imperfections but they're mild in comparison to so many others; cherry flavors in general are notoriously bad overall. It's oddly a little dry and has a slight “green” floral on top, along with that tartness, softness, and dryness, but it's very slight, and finishes stronger and without off-notes. No plastic or cough syrup anywhere. It seems like this could be mixed with a little bit of INW Cherries to cover the top and be a perfect cherry candy if you're looking for one of those, though some dryness would probably still be an issue. Very nice that it actually came close to tasting like I just had a cherry sucker that didn't include parts of the plastic wrapper or some other horrible thing.

There are two recipes on ATF that use it and I'm excited to try them both, [RWB](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/224685-rwb), a bomb pop profile, and [Cherry Limeade with a twist](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/196064-cherry_limeade_with_a_twist), where the twist is a bit of cream. I hope it tastes like a Sonic Cherry Limeade Creamslush. Does Sonic still have those? **TASK 2** and **TASK 3**

**Strawberry & Cream**

It's a strawberry cream with just enough butyric acid in there to make it a little bit pukey. Advice: Just say no. Best strawberry and cream is still make your own out of your own favorite strawberries and creams, but if you must have a strawberry + cream flavoring, there are plenty of options that don't taste regurgitated. **TRASH 12**

**Sweet Corn**

Speaking of tasting regurgitated. When I first tried this I desperately wanted to make it work because it was so different from anything I'd tried and really tastes like corn, but there's a bit of a butyric pukey undertone to it there just doesn't seem to be any getting away from. Also, the corn flavor is insanely concentrated and overpowering. Just opening the bottle will leave you smelling canned corn in the room for a couple of days. **TRASH 13**

**Vanilla Cream**

MIlky, slightly sour, vanilla cream. Not horrible old milk sour to me, just a little on the sour side, with a brighter vanilla throughout. Mostly creamy, but a little chalky upfront. Not super thick. Comes across like vanilla-flavored Carnation Instant Breakfast that could use fresher milk and more stirring. **TRASH 14**

**Vanilla Custard**

It tastes like astronaut vanilla ice cream. Bright forward vanilla that tastes like vanilla ice cream top notes, but thin, like smelling vanilla ice cream rather than eating it. Slightly sweet but dry and even somewhat chalky base. Has some dairy to it but lacks that smooth, thick base. Nothing really horribly off, but I have similar yet better flavors. **TRASH 15**

**Vanilla Ice Cream**

It's great if you like your vanilla ice cream dark and malty with a side of drag racing. So, not great. It has a little bit of a burnt rubber off note just like peeling out. Health Cabin VIC does have a rich creamy ice cream body and a dark, malty vanilla note. And that burnt rubber is not strong, and might steep out if I give it more time, and might be due to over flavoring at 2%. But I don't know and am not going to bother finding out since there are easier options for vanilla ice cream. **TRASH 16**

**Vanilla Whipped Cream**

Nope. Extra buttery whipped cream with fake-tasting butter and dairy that tastes sour like old milk. Sweet with a nice vanilla note, but I can't deal with hints of popcorn butter and expired milk taste. **TRASH 17**

**Waffle**

Have not tried. Always on the lookout for the next great waffle flavor, I'll mix a sample of this at 0.5% and get back to you. **TASK 4**

**Watermelon**

Another one that still needs to be sampled. Will try 0.75% for starters on this one. **TASK 5**
