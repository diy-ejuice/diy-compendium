## CAPELLA

**Graham Cracker**

Cinnamon graham cracker, with just as much cinnamon as your average cinnamon graham cracker. But, nowhere as dry and crispy as graham crackers. Tastes like a graham cracker-flavored soft cookie. Very full and rich, even a little buttery. Great in bakeries and custards, super yummy, somewhat less great at actually being a graham cracker with the softness and richness.

I need this for [Titanic](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/48608#titanic_by_id10_t). Might as well try some other stuff so it's not just taking up space between Titanic mixings.

[Warlike Mailboxes](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/145963#warlike_mailboxes_by_ebc88) is kind of my fault so I'm obligated to try it, plus it looks great. **TASK 1**

[Marshmallow Graham](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/104106#marshmallow_gram_2_by_cygnusy1) does too, although my dude needs to be introduced to OoO Marshmallow Vanilla. **TASK 2**

And while we're messing with marshmallows, [Gooey Teddy](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/239844#gooey_teddy_by_lakesidecraftsman). **TASK 3**

**Grape**

This is more of a white grape flavor. Bland white grape flavor that's so bland it runs a little toward cardboard. But not dry like cardboard, actually a little juicy. Not offensive, but such a bland flavor, it's just a very bland vaguely grapish flavor that tastes a little more like white grape than red or purple grapes. It might be good for adding a little juiciness to another grape, I guess? It's not even sweet, which is weird from CAP. I was expecting sweet and syrup and instead it just sucks. I'm not even going looking for recipes. **TRASH 1**

**Grapefruit**

Like diluting a Grapefruit LaCroix with sugar water. That's not really what I was expecting from a CAP Grapefruit. I expected it to be sweet and syrupy and a little flat, without any real zesty notes, like some kind of imaginary grapefruit snow cone syrup. Instead it tastes kind of like a grapefruit soda, not just the syrup part, but the whole soda, bubbles and all. It's missing a lot of bitter bite and sharper top note acidity of a natural grapefruit or grapefruit juice, but instead has kind of a fizzy thing on top. It's also overly sweet for a natural grapefruit but not for a sugary soda. The fizzy bit makes it kind of interesting and tempting to play with, but overall it's very mellow and unassertive, especially for a citrus. That's why I say it's like diluting a grapefruit LaCroix with sugar water. It's a little bubbly, and it's sweeter than LaCroix, but the grapefruit itself has that same kind of LaCroix disappointingness. It has some depth and body to it, but that body is more syrupy sweetness with a subdued grapefruity flavor.

It's not that I haven't tried good mixes that have used it, I have, but it doesn't even crack the top 10 in my collection of grapefruit flavors. **TRASH 2**

**Greek Yogurt**

Chalk City. Mostly tastes like plain Chobani Greek Yogurt. That twang to it is just a little pukey - more pukey than cheesy -- but not very aggressive. It's thick and there's a richness to it that's almost buttery, but texturally it's all fucked up because it's just so chalky. It's chalky enough to be on the dry side for yogurts and it's less sweet than the average yogurt.

I personally got no love for the idea of vaping yogurt in general, chalky slightly pukey yogurt even less so. **TRASH 3**

**Green Apple**

Mostly tastes like lemon. Juicy, but some green Fabuloso vibes, or some kind of cleaning product, so not even a very good lemon. There is some green apple there underneath, but the juicy lemon scented cleaning product - not Pledge but some kind of cleaner, something soapier, is dominant. Some juicy lemon top notes and sweet/tart and almost creamy body. **TRASH 4**

**Green Apple Hard Candy**

Seriously good green apple hard candy. Tastes like a green apple sucker, no acetone BS that plagues a lot of green apple flavors, unapologetically candy without any apple peel to speak of. Weak, needs about 8% just to be an effective dose, 12% is a more filled-out single flavor. It's sweet and sticky and specifically tastes like hard candy, a little under-sweet for candy, but not something some sweetener can't fix. It's a little short on the tart punch of a jolly rancher, but does those green apple suckers really well.

Someday I'm going to have to choose between CAP Green Apple Hard Candy and the WF version that's called Green Hard Candy or Jolly Candy, not sure which, and I can already tell you that WF is going to win, but for now, if you need me, I'll be at my desk mixing myself a bottle of [Camp Tigerclaw](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/127046#camp_tigerclaw_by_concreteriver). **TASK 4**

**Grenadine**

**TRASH 5**. With prejudice! CAP Grenadine is without a doubt one of the worst flavors I've ever encountered.  
Think about a cherry flavor you wanted to like but couldn't. Chances are it mostly lasted like yummy cherry, but had a bit of an off-note that was just gnarly enough to ruin it. Plasticky. I've heard it referred to as a bottom shelf rum note and as plastic off-gassing. I call it the New Vinyl Shower Curtain off-note, because when I went to replace my shower curtain with a new vinyl shower curtain, as I took it out of the package and began to unfold it, my nose was filled with that cherry off note. No cherry, just that exact same terrible off-note from the cherry. Well, that is CAP Grenadine. No cherry, just the exact same off-note from a cherry. And nothing else. Instead of Grenadine, they could have just called it New Vinyl Shower Curtain and that would have been the most accurately named flavor you've ever seen.

**Harvest Berry**

It's a pretty polarizing flavor, with lots of people who either love it or hate it. Years ago, when there weren't as many options for flavorings, I enjoyed this one despite not quite figuring out what to do with it, and not knowing why it wasn't working. Trying it again though, I have to say there's just the slightest bit of some vaguely medicinal thing going on in there along with those brighter berry top notes, though in small amounts it might still be useful. People say they can pick out all sorts of things from this one - blueberry, blackberry, raspberry, cherry, strawberry - but it mostly just mooshes together into a unidentifiable mixed berry thing for me. What surprises me the most is how grapey it is on the back end, I taste a lot of grape in there and it kind of reminds me of how actual fruit juice drinks are mostly either grape or apple juice based with some added berries or whatever. It's a thick, full-bodied, juicy flavor.

I think I'm probably done with Harvest Berry, but [Waterberry](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/113187#waterberry_by_katumbas) looks awfully interesting, I will make that recipe Harvest Berry's last chance to not get kicked to the curb. **TASK 5**.

**Hazelnut V2**

Aggressively dry and a little harsh, not nearly as good as some other options of Hazelnut. Tastes ok, but just doesn't vape well at all. **TRASH 6**

**Hibiscus**

Sweet. Very sweet. Lingering syrupy, almost sticky sweetness. Gentle vaguely tropically floral, slightly bitter but not at all perfumey.

I need this to make [Pank Milk](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/184392#pank_milk_by_id10_t), but I've enjoyed it in so many other recipes over the years. Maybe one of these will get added to that list of CAP Hibiscus-containing gems:

[Malon√©e](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/283658) **TASK 6**

[Trinity](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/171731#trinity_public_release_by_folkart) **TASK 7**

[Lime Misty](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/241243#mlnikon_s_lime_misty_by_mixinvixens) **TASK 8**

**Honey**

Tastes like honey primarily, but less sugary sweet than honey, and with a floral aspect that tastes like wilted flowers and a tiny bit of hay and some cat pee. The hint of floral isn't bright as others and tastes like a bouquet that she's kept in a vase in water for sentimental reasons too long after they should have been thrown away. Just a little bit of decaying vegetation creeping in. But mostly honey. I actually don't think it would be too hard to make a good recipe out of this since it mostly tastes of honey, there are just some errant off notes to cover up or watch out for. Whether with fruit, tobacco, or bakery, maybe not so much with cream since that decaying floral thing with dairy flavors might get a bit sickening. This is a strong flavor at 0.5%.

Nope. I'm too old to deal with this shit. **TRASH 7**

**Honeydew Melon**

It's slightly on the underripe side of honeydew, or close to the rind, where it's got crunch to it, and also bit on the artificial, candy side of the spectrum as well. It's sweet, and a little juicy, but the sweetness doesn't have the same depth and pungency as real honeydew, at least not honeydew from the center of the melon. It's more like a candy flavor or syrupy sweetness. It also tastes a bit like it has some apple or pear in it, just a little, that punches up the crisp flavor but pulls away from authenticity a bit.

Not a bad flavor. Feels like one I can live without, but I want to at least give this [Melon Blow Pop](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/192240#melon_blow_pop_by_vensyboy) a mix first, it looks like a just-right use for CAP Honeydew Melon to me. **TASK 9**

**Horchata**

It tastes about like what you'd expect CAP Horchata to taste like. The cinnamon upfront tastes just like the cinnamon in CAP Graham Cracker and about the same strength, too, so the cinnamon is fairly light. It tastes fine to me but I'm sure it comes across as a little metallic to some people, since CAP Graham Cracker and Cinnamon Danish Swirl do. Heavy French-type vanilla milky sweet cream under it, with some somewhat nutty maybe rice-ish flavor kind of hiding behind the vanilla. Very thick, very smooth. Might need some help with both the cinnamon and rice departments to get a more authentic Horchata but seems like a versatile option for cinnamon + vanilla cream.

Not a bad flavor, but nothing I'm just itching to do with it. **TRASH 8**

**Hot Cocoa**

Wow, that's terrible. It's like vaping something that was designed to taste like weird plasticky slash rubbing alcohol kinda chemical off-note, but it accidentally has a little hot chocolate taste to it. Just foul. It's very full and rich, but what's the point of that if it tastes so bad? The richness of CAP Hot Cocoa seems to make it worse, even, kinda nauseating. **TRASH 9**
