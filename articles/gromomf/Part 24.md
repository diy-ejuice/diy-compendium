TASK OR TRASH - Each flavor gets assigned at least one task or it goes in the trash.

## CAPELLA

**Coconut**

Update. Well, shit. I really wanted to get rid of CAP Coconut, frankly because I have several coconuts that are just plain better flavors. But then along came [Deez Dragon Nuts](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/261981), described as “Mrs. MixnJuice's other ADV. It tastes roughly like a Dragon Fruit Paloma we drank in a cafe in Italy.” Mrs. MixnJuice apparently has great taste in vape juice and husbands/mixers. This is lovely. I don't really get the blackcurrant or blood orange separately, and really have to think about it to pick out the dragonfruit. They basically blend together into some kind of fantasy fruit that tastes a bit like pink grapefruit only darker and without the acid or bitterness, a splash of white gummy bear, with a very sweet creamy coconut undercurrent and lingering coconut candy aftertaste. I’m keeping this one. I did have a thought that probably TFA Coconut Candy or FLV Sweet Coconut would work as a sub, and possibly even an improvement, but I’m not sure how much of which of those to use and don’t want to mess up what might be a delicate balance of flavors. Before I tried it, I thought it would be something I’d like better with a bit of sweetener and/or cooling, but no. It’s quite sweet without any sweetener and cooling could mess up that fantastic fantasy fruit situation.

Since I’m now being forced to keep CAP Coconut, what else can I do with it? The only thing I saw that interested me is this [Coconut Thai Remixed](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/48929#coconut_thai_remixed_by_seakow). I’ve messed with some similar Thai ideas before that I didn’t think were good enough to share, but maybe this one is. **TASK 1**

## Flavor West

**Sassafras**

It tastes like weird hippy molasses with some green plants in it. Or like someone started making syrup to make root beer and gave up 3/4 of the way through, leaving out the root part and the wintergreen. I’ve not encountered sassafras outside of root beer but I couldn’t begin to think of how to build one without it. Seems like it could also work to make another root beer flavor more real, natural, interesting, or whatever. By itself it tastes like herbal molasses. There’s nothing wrong with it if you’re trying to build a root beer or augment one, but I don’t really need it. **TRASH 1**

**Scooby Drink**

According to FW, it tastes “just like the classic banana, coconut, melon, and pineapple cocktail.” That’s half pina colada, with banana and melon. Yum, right? Wrong. I did not get that at all. I get whipped cream, juicy fruit gum, and soap. It tastes and feels like rich, sweet whipped cream, but one flavored with the same flavoring used to make juicy fruit gum, along with a heaping amount of Ivory liquid soap. I think I exhaled bubbles like a cartoon character that drank detergent. Single-flavor accurate Tide Pod vape? I could not change my wick fast enough after this. **TRASH 2**

**Shirley Temple**

It’s supposed to be 7 up or ginger ale with a bunch of grenadine and a maraschino cherry. It’s definitely lemon-lime and something red and grenadine-ish. There’s really not enough cherry to use for a cherry, what cherry is there in the finish tastes a little medicinal to me, but not like a new vinyl shower curtain. It’s not terrible, but it’s one I could definitely live without. **TRASH 3**

**S’Mores**

It pretty much much JUST gets the graham and toasted part right. It’s like you toasted a graham cracker, and that’s about it. There’s a touch of chocolate, and it’s sweeter than just a toasted graham cracker, but that’s not a big rich hunk of melty chocolate or gooey marshmallow. Seems like you could build a s’more out of this, using this as the graham and toasted note, and adding more chocolate and some marshmallow. Of note, FLV Smore is pretty much just chocolate and very slightly toasted marshmallow. It seems like you could mix the two together and arrive at a pretty decent s’more layer. I was disappointed to not see a recipe doing that, so, fine, I’ll just give it a try myself and see what happens.

S’more Experiment v1 **TASK 2**

| Co. | Flavor      | %    |
| --- | ----------- | ---- |
| FW  | S'mores     | 2    |
| FLV | Smore       | 1.75 |
| CAP | Super Sweet | 0.25 |

**Spearmint**

Sharper and bolder than the FW’s Doublemint Gum flavor but tastes very similar primarily, but without that gum base and accents. Candy sweet and if not completely artificial, at least extract-y - not actual mint leaf. Basically just that, spearmint gum without the gum. **TRASH 4**

**Sprinkles**

Spot on Sprinkles. It’s sweet, dry and chalky, without a lot of flavor but with some artificial vanilla and a food dye finish. Those things are loaded with artificial coloring which is supposed to be flavorless, but isn’t really. Artificial coloring tastes... funny. Not funny haha, but funny... off. If you don’t believe me that food dye has a flavor, do side-by-side blindfolded taste tests of two glasses of water, one unadulterated, one loaded up with a bunch of different food colorings. You’ll be able to tell which is which and that bit of oddness is here. Anyway, this FW Sprinkles has that food dye in the finish after that sweet dry chalky body and touch of vanilla. Off note-wise, has the very slightest touch of something like anise. Might be perfect for adding that “sprinkles” note to ice cream or funfetti cake. I could live without it, but there’s at least one interesting-looking recipe I want to try first.

[Vanilla Buttermilk Cake](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/215619#vanilla_buttermilk_cake_by_lukeloop) **TASK 3**

**Star Candy**

Also known as Starburst Type, I think. I can’t remember trying it. Will do a sample at 4% and while I’m at it,

[Mountain Rose Apple](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/124607#mountain_rose_apple_by_enyawreklaw). **TASK 4**

[Cherry Hills](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/84100#cherry_hills_ejm_x_chef_s_one_shot_by_concreteriver). **TASK 5**

[Pink Burst](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/155682#pink_burst_by_enyawreklaw) **TASK 6**

**Stick Gum 2x Mint**

So that’s just FW Doublemint Gum sold under a different name. I already threw this away once. **TRASH 5**

**Strawberry**

Like the elevator music of strawberries. Not glaringly off but just, ho hum blah. Tastes fairly natural but again there’s that out of season strawberry that just doesn’t have that much flavor, with just a little artificial bump to it. Has a soft tartness to it but not a lot of other complexity, isn’t a very deep flavor but isn’t top heavy, it’s more just in the middle, without that brighter top note or ripe, juicy depth.

I want to trash it for being so aggressively mediocre, but I’m aware that mediocre flavors can be used as a small part of a great recipe, so I’ll give this [Strawberry Milk V2](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/292332#strawberry_milk_v2_by_fadedjay1) a try first. **TASK 7**

**Strawberry Banana**

Lots of candy banana, especially on top, and light artificial strawberry backnote. A little better balance between the strawberry and banana here and you could be close to something like a strawberry-banana Koolaid or putting a Banana Runt and a Strawberry Runt in your mouth at the same time, which is the best way to eat Runts. Sweet, smooth, can’t find anything wrong with it aside from the blatant artificiality and the banana to strawberry ratio being unbalanced. Still, I feel like putting a better strawberry and a better banana together is the way to go, as is the case with most two-profile-in-one-bottle flavors. **TRASH 6**

**Strawberry Kiwi**

This is not taking FW Kiwi, which is great, and adding a fun candy strawberry to it. It’s taking FW Kiwi and adding a bland, mediocre strawberry to it. Could be a lot better, do not recommend. Mix your own, better strawberry with FW Kiwi and make a better Strawberry Kiwi. For example, I think JF Sweet Strawberry would be a great one that would stand out and have a nice strawberry-kiwi candy vibe. Pushing to 6%, gets a little perfumy. If you must use it, I wouldn’t go over 5%. No off notes at 4%, it’s sweet and syrupy, that strawberry just sucks. It’s such a lifeless, sad little strawberry where there should be a vibrant strawberry candy. **TRASH 7**

**Strawberry Lemonade**

Country Time Strawberry Lemonade. Neither the strawberry nor lemon tastes like actual fruit, but it’s very sweet and tart and tastes like strawberry lemonade from a powder or strawberry lemonade candy. Starts off candy lemon with that strawberry in the middle and then a sweet yet acidic finish. Personally I’d prefer some actual lemons and especially actual strawberries, but if you’re going for the powdered mix, I’m not really getting anything off. It’s also smooth for citrus and tastes like it would pair well with all kinds of fruits, especially strawberry obviously.

Basically for real lemonade with real strawberry, you should just build your own rather than using any of these, but if you want a Country Time Strawberry Lemonade you can probably take this to 8% or so and add a little sweetener, cooling as well if you’re into that, and be good to go. I saw a recipe I wanted to try, [Malone Monade](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/264900#malone_monade_by_eyemsam), but I don’t have SSA Double Watermelon. **TRASH 8**

**Strawberry Milkshake**

Separation between a small amount of an entirely pleasant if somewhat fluffy vanilla cream, like a low dose of their vanilla bean ice cream, underneath a somewhat underwhelming strawberry. The strawberry tastes like a combination of real strawberry and artificial strawberry and that makes it well-rounded, but it just isn’t very vibrant at all. It’s not bad, which is more than can be said for quite a few of these strawberry + cream type flavors, but between the lack of more richness in the cream and the lack of punch in the strawberry, it’s not great either. Smooth, very sweet finish. If I want a strawberry milkshake, I’ll mix a strawberry milkshake that’s better than this. I don’t even have to create my own, there are dozens of recipes for that and I’m sure most if not all of them have FW Strawberry Milkshake beat. **TRASH 9**

**Strawberry Shortcake**

Contains 10 to 20% fructose. I won’t be buying more of this and don’t recommend anyone else buy it, mainly for that reason. On the other hand, it’s pretty delicious, in a Little Debbie strawberry swiss roll kind of way, but I think that’s just because it’s just their yellow cake mixed with their mediocre strawberry, and yellow cake is delicious. The strawberry isn’t that great and it doesn’t have any whipped cream like you want a strawberry shortcake to have.

I will at least try this [Night Cap](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/191439#night_cap_strawberry_shortcake_clone_by_bigred) before I ditch it, though. There’s no way that’s not tasty, even if does do nasty things to my cotton and coils. **TASK 8**

**Sugar Cookie**

Super soft, basically marshmallow-level fluffy, no crunch at all, or even any bakery texture. It has some cookie flavor but it tastes a little more like licking dry frosting off of a cookie than the actual cookie. Overly sweet. It’s also very vanilla-forward and that vanilla is a bit floral, like, just floral enough to remind you that vanilla comes from a flower. FW Sugar Cookie isn’t an offensive flavor, at least to me, but it is a kinda weird one.

There are a couple things I want to try:

[Waffle Me This](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/49247#waffle_me_this_remixmonth_by_folkart) is a five-year-old recipe with much more recent glowing reviews. **TASK 9**

[Cookie Addiction](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/216566#cookie_addiction_by_nks). Dat WF Cookie Butter and VT Sweet Cream got me. I’ll sub JF Cookie for the FA Cookie. **TASK 10**

**Swedish Fish**

Gummy red cherry candy with a touch of floral raspberry. Has a sweet, thick jelly candy/gummy candy body. Just a touch of that weird chemically/rubbery thing like FW Gummy Bear along with that body. Fairly restrained flavor compared to the body. Wouldn’t call it weak, but definitely needs some help with the fruit, and it seems like cranking it up will just make it get too weird. But despite the touch of floral raspberry and weird rubbery thing, seems like those could be buried under the fruit that it needs anyway and it should work for a red fruit gummy-to-chewy candy texture/body. Some throat hit, but only when the wick starts to get a little dry.

If I really, really wanted to vape Swedish Fish, [This recipe](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/239672#vermillion_swedish_fish_gummy_candy_by_alch3m1st) looks like it might get the job done. But, I don’t. I DO want to vape [Peach Mango Jello Custard](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/80974#peach_mango_jello_custard_by_thedrstore). **TASK 11**

**Sweet & Tart**

Completely useless coil gunk. It’s very sweet but mostly just tastes like sugar, with a little hint of vague tart fruitiness, until it starts tasting a little burned. No wonder, with the 20 to 30% sugar syrup that’s in there. It took longer than I thought it would to start tasting burned but I didn’t make it through a second re-drip. **TRASH 10**

**Sweet Tarts Type**

Same thing. **TRASH 11**

**Sweetener**

If CAP Super Sweet is a 10/10 level of sweetness, this is a solid 7.5.  
Seems to just be sucralose. Cleaner-tasting than super sweet. Tastes like sugar in the same way that chickory tastes like coffee, margarine tastes like butter, and diet coke tastes like regular coke. No inhale flavor, almost no flavor at first beyond plain VG sweetness, then rapidly building flavor that actually seems most intense immediately after the exhale. Major sugar lips. Different people react to it differently. I didn’t notice any throat or other irritation while vaping it at 2%, but after about 5 ml in a short time, I felt like I had something coating my windpipe and I had to cough. Similar to the way some people, of which I am one, tend to cough if they eat too much greasy food. I also felt like my sense of taste was impaired for a while afterward. The next juice I tried seemed muted compared to what I remembered it tasting like earlier the same day, but then it was back to normal after eating and drinking and an hour or two hours. Cotton looked a little crunchy after 5 ml at 2% in a short time but coils were still perfectly new-looking.

I have a big bottle of this and it’s not going anywhere until it gets replaced with a new big bottle of it. I will now use this opportunity as an excuse to mix some of my favorite recipes that employ it, and try a few new ones.

[Alphonse](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/206999#alphonse_by_wolfwheeler) Butterscotch Pudding! **TASK 12**

[Gourd is Dead](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/236620#gourd_is_dead_by_wolfwheeler). Pumpkin-Spiced Old Fashioned. I love it. **TASK 13**

[Impropapiety](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/113012#impropapiety_by_id10_t). One of my own. Iced Tea with Papaya Syrup. It’s been a while since I last mixed it and a long while since I created it but I recall being very happy with the way this one came out. **TASK 14**

[Nakatomi Nutter](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/250335#nakatomi_nutter_by_spdrjrslm). A PB & Marshmallow Fluff Sammy. Add strawberry jelly to that and it’s called a crackhead sandwich where I come from. Anyway, yes please to that profile and as best I can tell from looking at it, that’s going to be super good. **TASK 15**

[Saturo Gojo](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/223808#satoru_gojo_by_wolfwheeler). Ube milk tea. Awful lot of wolfwheeler on this list, isn’t there? **TASK 16**

[Saito](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/208511#saito_by_wolfwheeler). Jelly-filled doughnut. More wolfwheeler. Look, I went to ATF and went to FW Sweetener under sort by flavor. Then I sorted FW Sweetener recipes first by rating, then by simple, then by new and with each or those sorts, l went through about 10 pages ruling out things I couldn’t mix, didn’t want to mix, or was already planning to mix but haven’t gotten around to yet, and putting rest in the task tracker. I don’t know what the deal is with wolfie recipes today. **TASK 17**

[Custard for Dummies](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/237649#abc_123_awful_s_basic_custard_by_anawfulwizard). Finally something not made by wolfwheeler. I don’t know if that will be the best custard I’ve ever had, but I’m sure it will be good. **TASK 18**

[Baker’s Pipe](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/292531#baker_s_pipe_by_dippindabbin). Now that looks interesting! Bakery tobacco. **TASK 19**

[Benimaru](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/243290#benimaru_by_wolfwheeler). Peanut Butter Pie feat. Honey. And we’re back to wolfie again. **TASK 20**

[Mango Cream Soda](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/199267#mango_cream_soda_by_johnny2vapes). Another favorite! I remember thinking this would still be just as good without the WF Island mango and just a little more of both of the other mango flavors to compensate, but until I run out of Island Mango, I think I’ll just make it as written. **TASK 21**

[Cookie Dough](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/228438#cookie_dough_developed2banger_by_deftohms). I have to see if adding FW Sweetener and some Medicine Flower Dark Chocolate really makes WF Cookie Dough work. **TASK 22**

[Monkey Diaper](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/304104#monkey_diaper_by_ironside). Name is a bit, what do the kids say? “Triggering” to me, as someone who as a teen learned the hard way why you don’t have staring contests versus the monkeys at the zoo. But, I still want to give this stuff a chance to gunk my coils all up. **TASK 23**

**Swiss Cherry**

It is more than a little waxy-tasting, as if “swiss” means drizzled in melted crayon, but that there’s some tartness and slight florality on top, and there's a little Tahitian-type vanilla in the base. There’s some harshness along for that tartness ride to be aware of that tartness and touch of vanilla makes it more interesting so it’s not quite like vaping straight up wax like FW’s Maraschino Cherry is, but it’s pretty waxy. I’m keeping that one because small amounts of it are used in 2 or 3 recipes (that would probably be better without it) that I want to try. But I have no such recipes for this one. **TRASH 12**
