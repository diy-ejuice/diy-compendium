TASK OR TRASH - Each flavor gets assigned at least one task or it goes in the trash.

# Capella Italian Lemon Sicily

Update. I tried two recipes to see if I needed to hang on to CAP Italian Lemon Sicily. I gave them both five deserved stars, but neither of them is something I feel I need to mix again. One of them, [A Real Orange Juice](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/157915-a_real_orange_juice_finally) is definitely worth mentioning, though. It's pretty awesome. Not 100% perfect, but it's closer to a glass of fresh-squeezed OJ than I ever thought would be possible in vape form after trying tons of orange flavors. If that interests you, you should check it out. I'm seriously impressed by it, I'm glad it exists and that I had an opportunity to mix and enjoy it, but it's just not something I see myself craving more of. So, CAP Italian Lemon Sicily, goes in the **TRASH 1**

# Jungle Flavors

**Dulce de Leche**

Delicious flavor, not quite accurate. It tastes like rich brown sugar, not exactly like DDL, but kinda close-ish. You know that goop inside a cinnamon roll that's formed from brown sugar, cinnamon, and the butter or shortening that leaches out of the dough. Picture that, but without the cinnamon.

The thing I love about this flavor is that it's not TFA Brown Sugar, which often needs to steep for a bit to not have a weird chemically taste. I can use JF Dulce de Leche for a shake-and-vapeable brown sugar note.

If I didn't miscount, I have seven recipes that used it already on the agenda. Here's two more:

[Carmel Goodness](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/299529-caramel_goodness). Just four tasty flavors - JF DDL, WF Bavarian Cream, WF Caramel Butter, and WF Salted Caramel. That has to be good. **TASK 1**

[Tres Leches Layered Cake](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/258563-nachefs_tres_leches_layered_cake__developed_tribute). It's got a ton of ingredients but if it really tastes like Tres Leches they'll be worth digging out. **TASK 2**

**Espresso**

In the bottle it smells just like a truck stop bathroom. Somewhat fortunately, when mixed and vaped it doesn't taste that way. It does however taste like a cup of dark roast coffee with two or three lumps of sugar left out overnight, used as an ashtray, used as a spit cup for a little cherry Skoal, and then drunk. It's coffee, but it's both sweet and ashy, and stale, with just a slight hint of a medicinal cherry note. Not the good kind of ashy like little hints of ashiness you might find in a tobacco, like literal cigarette ashes put out in coffee. Disgusting. And that cherry medicine/chewing tobacco note, while faint, eww. **TRASH 2**

**Fresh Cream**

Similar to FA Cream Fresh, but I don't think it's better. It's quite a bit sweeter, and a little thicker and fuller on the low end, with a creamier mouthfeel. However, the front end is dry. Like dry enough to be a little throat itchy for me. Another difference is that there's a good bit of vanilla down in that base. Which can be fine, but there are a lot of vanilla creams and not that many good non-vanilla options for cream like FA Cream Fresh. But it is a sweet dairy cream and probably perfectly useable. It might be great to add to a milkshake with ice cream flavor to make it more milky.

It has one public recipe on ATF that doesn't look like something I just have to try. **TRASH 3**

**Fuji**

This is very similar to the much more widely used FA Fuji. I'm not even sure I could tell them apart in a lot of mixes, but when you try them side by side there are some noticeable differences. One, JF is smoother and not as sharp. Still sharp, just not quite as sharp. While there's some peel there I don't get that errant hint of spice to it that FA has. JF is also a bit sweeter. But there's a trade off for the sweetness - it's drier than FA.

I've already planned to use it to mix an Apple Crumble Cheesecake recipe and a Lychee Apple Hard Candy. Will also try [Truth Serum](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/251691-truth_serum/reviews), a different approach to the classic combination of pear and coconut. **TASK 3**

**Honey Peach**

Juicy, very sweet peach, lots of flavor that's mostly very ripe but not overripe peach, thick and full, but it does have a slight, light green floral high note. Doesn't really taste like honey, and it's not supposed to, it's named after a type of peach grown in China that's called a honey peach. Do get some very mild scratchiness with this one, but nowhere near the harshness of some other peaches. That green or floral bit gets a bit much over 1.5%, but 1 to 1.5% is perfect for adding ripeness, sweetness, and juiciness to another peach. Love combining it with just one other peach, such as FA White Peach or INW Peach.

I count 10 recipes that use it, already listed under other flavors. Here's one more:

[Peach Pear](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/169995-peach_pear). There are several recipes out there that combine peaches and pears, which is a combo I don't think I've ever explored before. Out of the ones that I have all the ingredients for, this one looked best to me. **TASK 4**

**Honeydew Melon**

Smooth, sweet, juicy, kinda mellow, slightly candied/artificial tasting but mostly natural honeydew flavor without any off-notes. The candied/artificial thing shows up a bit more at 3% than at 2% but it just tastes like the honeydew syrup they use to make slushies at one of my favorite boba tea places, not weird or off-putting. The issue with this one is that it slowly fades over time before eventually leveling out, so you should either plan to shake-and-vape it or plan to let it steep for a couple of weeks to see where it winds up.

Got a couple lined up already for this one, here's another:

[Jamaican 10 Speed](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/jamaican_10_speed_) The JF Honeydew probably gets a bit lost in this new recipe, but the coconut-pineapple-banana-rum combo looks so yummy. **TASK 5**

**Juicy Lemon**

Sweetened lemon candy flavor. Pretty bold, a bit tart, vibrant. Maybe not really juicy but not dry, either. Like a candy lemon that might have some actual lemon juice in there. No harshness, very smooth. Fades a little, as many lemons do, but not as badly as something like FA Lemon Sicily.

I need it for a couple of old favorites and one or two new things I've planned to try. Here's a couple more that look great.

[Deadlights](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/66332-deadlights/). Strawberry chewy candy. **TASK 6**

[FIZZY LEMON](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/311219-fizzy_lemon). Indeed, that looks like a recipe for a legitimately fizzy lemon. **TASK 7**

**Mango**

This is a weird one. It tastes like sweet mango candy, wrapped in a natural, piney mango peel, eaten peel and all. It would be so good without that peel but with it, it just comes across as very strange. **TRASH 4**

**Marshmallow**

Seriously sugary sweet. Vanilla is a little bright, more of an artificial type vanilla, and pretty forward, but it's contrasted with a bit of a darker malty note, almost like a cereal marshmallow fished out of the bottom of the bag that still has some cereal dust on it. The vanilla specifically is bordering on being a little chemically at 3% but I'm almost entirely certain that's just overflavoring and it needs to be used quite a bit lower than 3%, probably more like 1.5%, 2% max. Not creamy at all, crunchy actually, very excessively dry for a big puffy marshmallow, but just right for a cereal marshmallow. Sugary, with a lingering powdery sugary feel. You could probably clone this using CAP Simply Vanilla and some OoO Powdered Sugar added to FA Marshmallow. JF Marshmallow might not be a better ingredient than a lot of other marshmallows for versatility in mixing, but it's a better cereal marshmallow. If you want a plain cereal marshmallow, this is it.

I've already planned to work on improving my [Lucky's Charms](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/99041-luckys_charms) to replace FW Cake Batter Dip (fructose). Will also try replacing the FLV Marshmallow and FLV Whipped Cream in there with JF Marshmallow. **TASK 8**

**Milk Chocolate**

It does actually taste like milk chocolate, but I also get a mild but yucky plasticky off note and aftertaste. It tricked me into thinking I was gonna get that milk chocolate right up front, where it's silky and chocolatey, but then it just falls apart into a plasticky cream. **TRASH 5**

**Mint**

Peppermint mouthwash. Sharp, astringent, thin. Some bitterness along with a lingering sweetness that tastes like it has lots of Stevia in there. **TRASH 6**

**Pineapple**

One of Jungle Flavors' older flavors, before a change in ownership and ECX becoming Flavor Jungle. Its age shows. It does taste like sweet pineapple, but there's also rotten and oniony notes. **TRASH 7**

**Pink Burst**

Mostly tastes just like a pink starburst, tart and sweet, with a thick taffy body, maybe a little on the thin side for something so thick and chewy, but just a little. Could use more strawberry to punch up that fruity flavor. But it tears my throat up. Odd combination of a smooth, creamy mouthfeel and a vicious throat. I want to add something else smooth and creamy to see about smoothing over that harshness, but that's almost definitely going to require more strawberry to correct the balance. Still, seems like a great base to build around for a Pink Starburst or other strawberry taffy-type candy.

I need it because I want to try Deadlights (see Juicy Lemon) and a couple of others. I also want to try [Razzle Burst](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/175328-razzle_burst), but INW Lemon Mix is no more and there really isn't a great sub for that lemon zest flavor that I'm aware of. But it's only 0.25%, I'll try FE Lemon instead. It won't be the same, but it'll probably be pretty good. **TASK 9**

**RY4 Double**

Similar to TFA RY4 Dub but with some striking differences. First of all, it's more potent. 4% of this is really pushing it. Like TFA it's mostly sweet, thick caramel, but there's some actual tobacco here that comes in after that. It's kind of a toasty tobacco. There's also quite a bit of brown sugar, and even some of that sharper, almost-bitter molassesy note that's associated with dark brown sugar. I also get this just a hint of a raisin-like fruity flavor that a lot of tobaccos have, but only intermittently. No discrete vanilla that I can pick up in this one. It's more complex and interesting than TFA RY4 Double and if I'm going to vape one of them solo or taste one of them as the primary flavor in a mix it would be this, hands down, but probably means it has some comparative limitations in terms of versatility. But basically, RY4 Double with ACTUAL TOBACCO NOTES and not just dirty caramel.

I love this, so I wasn't surprised to count an even dozen recipes that use it on my must-try list.

Here's a couple more, both very simple ones.

[VCT for Dummies](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/219655-vct_for_dummies). Three-ingredient vanilla custard tobacco. **TASK 10**

[123 Roasted Pecan RY4](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/241511-123_roasted_pecan_ry4). Oh my goodness, yes. **TASK 11**

**Spearmint**

Spearmint hard candy. Artificial candy spearmint with a sweet candy spearmint body. Tastes like those disc candies that are green striped instead of the red-striped peppermint ones. Lingering minty sweetness. Not bad, just don't need it. **TRASH 8**

**Strawberry Harvest**

Mostly an artificial candy-type strawberry at heart, but different than many other candy strawberries, more complex. Top note is that bright red very sweet candy strawberry, but the base is a darker, lingering jammy sweetness, almost like a mixed berry jam that's mostly strawberry but has a bit of some darker berries in there. Bit more like blueberries than other dark berries but not clearly identifiable as a blueberry. Another one that's not bad, but also one I'll be fine without. **TRASH 9**

**Strawberry Sweet**

Pretty much the goo in the middle of one of grandma's strawberry hard-on-the-outside candies.. Sweet, syrupy, unabashedly artificial candy strawberry without much complexity to it. Relatively brawny, saturated candy strawberry. Does have a little bit of throat hit with it for me until it has steeped for three or four days, but does not fade like some other strawberries.

I need it to try a bunch of recipes noted in earlier editions of GRoMoMF. Here's even more:

[mlNikon's Stb trifle](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/224318-mlnikons_stb_trifle). I might have skipped it but the VT Sweet Cream in there sold me. **TASK 12**

[Berry Splash](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/berry_splash_3). The official recipe only has three ingredients, but the mixer also suggests three additives and I'm gonna go for all three.**TASK 13**

[Lemon Strawberry](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/321363-lemon_strawberry). There are a bunch of strawberry + lemon recipes out there to choose from, this one looks pretty good to me. FE Lemon FTW. **TASK 14**

[nubes de bebe](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/317652-nubes_de_beb%C3%A9). Strawberry Hazelnut Vanilla Custard. **TASK 15**

**Tropic**

“Pineapple + Peach with light Coconut undertones” according to Flavor Jungle. I didn't know what I was getting into with this one but damn, that's some tasty stuff. Full bodied, fully saturated flavor, mouthwatering. Sweet candy pineapple upfront, and that “light coconut undertones” tastes like the pina colada lifesaver in the lifesavers tropical pack. The peach flavor is a little harder to pick out than the pineapple and coconut but it's a bit like peach rings; the overall effect is like a mouthful of tropical-flavored candies. No harshness, no weird yucky notes. Definitely not in the “natural” realm of fruit but really nice candy flavor.

Only one public recipe using it, I'll give it a try. [Tropical Blue Slushie](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/123107-tropical_blue_slushie). **TASK 16**

**Vanilla**

Oddly dark and yet fruity at the same time, kind of cherryish, and a bit floral. Strange to find these notes that I've come to associate with really bright artificial vanillas hanging out with a darker vanilla-extract kind of vanilla. Not really unpleasant, but just kind of odd. Not creamy, kind of watery and thin, almost juicy. Don't need it. **TRASH 10**

**Watermelon**

It's a watermelon that runs a little more toward the realistic end of the spectrum as far as the main watermelon flavor, but it has a thick and oddly creamy texture. Almost like a watermelon starburst minus the starburst tartness and artificiality, or watermelon taffy, that same kind of candy creaminess. I think there's a fairly well-hidden bit of vanilla in there, it almost tastes like some kind of watermelon mixed with just a touch of TFA Vanilla Swirl. It's definitely a pleasant vape by itself, but kind of odd. Very sweet, lingering sweet watermelon flavor, but also lingering is that oddly creamy mouthfeel. I don't want to try any of the recipes that use it. **TRASH 11**

**Yellow Cake**

Pretty good cake. It's sweet and accurate, but a little thin. It's moist but not so moist that the cake body is bogged down. Accents of butter and some vanilla. I have noticed that it's a pretty submissive flavor in mixes. Cranking it up doesn't help and just causes some weird off plasticky notes over 3%; it might need some backup from another bakery flavor to make a great cake recipe.

Already planned to try 8 recipes that use it, including a couple I'm really excited about. Here's one more that I'm mostly interested in because I want to see what that marshmallow flavor is doing there: [Pucker Up](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/214856-pucker_up). **TASK 17**
