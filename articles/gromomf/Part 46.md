TASK OR TRASH - Each flavor gets assigned at least one task or it goes in the trash.

## CAPELLA

**Honeydew Melon**

Update. I gave CAP Honeydew Melon one chance to stick around, a recipe called “Melon Blow Pop.” Before trying it, I wondered what made this recipe a "blow pop" considering there aren't any gum flavors, but something about the way these flavors combine does give it a very interesting bubblegum-y aspect in addition to the candy melon and apple. And the candy apple-melon is great. Unfortunately, I also get a slight perfumy-type off note from the recipe. Specifically, a baby scent perfume. You know, whatever it is that makes baby stuff like baby lotion, baby oil, baby powder all have that same baby scent. I hate that, so CAP Honeydew Melon is history. **TRASH 1**

## FLAVOUR ART

**Royal**

Accidentally passed over this one last time. I found it to be a kind of warm and spicy tobacco; with a spice note or notes similar to cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, and ginger, but not specifically or distinctly any of those. Also found it odd that despite having no menthol taste or cooling it kind of hits me right in the same spot that menthol does.

I purchased this flavor to make [Chem Twista Lime](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/102517-chem_twista_lime) - cigarette with a pinch of lime - and will continue to use it for that. **TASK 1** But, I can't find anything else that I want to do with it.

**Shade**

I don't know what this is, but it's not tobacco. It tastes like dirty cooked fruit sweetness, like just part of cooked dark berries or stewed prunes, just the sweetness from them and not their distinct aromas, mixed with something earthy and pushing dirty tobacco but not authentically tobacco. But, it does taste like it would be a good ingredient to use in a fruity tobacco, like you would need a tobacco, and a fruit, but this could be a bridge ingredient.

Already plan to mix CBV's [Cherry Oak Tobacco](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/97500-cherry_oak_tobacco) that uses it. Will also try his [Southern Lights](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/100154-southern_lights) recipe for a bourbon-vanilla tobacco that uses it **TASK 2**, and the very solid looking [Bob's Bacco](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/273413-bobs_bacco). **TASK 3** I just wished the new ATF showed steep times because I'm not sure how long to steep these. Anyone have a guess? Three weeks sound about right?

**Soho**

I don't consider this tobacco flavor. It's more like... Dirty Trail Mix, but in the best possible way.

Slightly dirty roasted nut crust? It's an odd, complex, flavor that's oddly weak for FA (8% is not unusual for a mix) with something lightly tobacco-ish, kind of toasty, in there somewhere along with a lot of other stuff - some roasted nuttiness, something like a graham cracker-type or pie crust bakery, a bit of caramel or brown-sugar like sweetness but not too sweet, maybe some raisin-y type sweetness as well. Dry, yet smooth. It's not a rich flavor but it has plenty of dry bakery-like body.

No, I'm not throwing away FA Soho. I need it for [1-2-3 Burley](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/210327-1_2_3_burley_) **TASK 4** and it's used in about 10 recipes I'm planning to try.

Adding to that - I can't wait to try [Pistachio Brulee - Soho](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/96955-_pistachio_br%C3%BBl%C3%A9e__soho). It's a lot of TFA Pistachio and not a lot of FA Soho for a “comforting warm deep dessert tobacco,” but I still think it's going to be terrific. **TASK 5**

Will also add [Maga](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/280746-maga) for the simplicity - it's just FA Soho, FLV Mild Tobacco, and FLV Vanilla tobacco. **TASK 6**

And because I'm feeling brave, [Arcanite](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/276024-arcanite), a weird-looking recipe that mixes Soho with Meringue, White Peach, and TFA Dragonfruit. **TASK 7**

**Sour Wizard**

Held off on ever trying this for a long time because I'd already been burnt by too many supposedly sour things to get excited about FA coming out with Sour Wizard. Anyway, it doesn't really taste sour, not like sour candy tastes sour, not at 2% anyway, but it definitely has a noticeably tart “pop” to it, more so than the others. Very bright. Other sour additives don't have much fruitiness but this one does have a very slight green apple kind of taste to it. Top heavy with a dead finish but the sour-ish flavor does carry just a little deeper than just being right on top. The usual suspect acids might be the main ingredients, but FA definitely did more than just put malic and/or citric acid in a bottle with PG, and it shows. Unfortunately, I could not find a single recipe using it that I both felt inclined to mix and had all the ingredients to mix. **TRASH 2**

**Spearmint**

Aka, “White Winter.” Tastes like the disembodied spirit of weak spearmint gum. Not much body or sweetness. No leafy green stuff. Not extra methol-ed up.

I'm pretty sure I would be fine without it but there is just one recipe I want to try first, just to make sure.

[Spearing Mint, Creamy Concoction](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/161127-spearing_mint_creamy_concoction) is one. Although FA and TFA Spearmints aren't the mints I'd choose for the job, I'm really interested in this “slight spearmint note with sweetened heavy cream” profile, and the sweetened heavy cream part looks great. **TASK 8**

**Stark Apple**

Sweet red apple, fairly accurately tastes like a red delicious apple or apple juice. I think red delicious is actually the least delicious of apples, but if you don't, or you need that as a component, this offers it. I guess some people say it tastes more like a yellow apple but I always associate those with having more of a “ripe,” kinda sweaty taste. FA Stark Apple is quite sweet, with a deep natural sweetness, not a ton of flavor, but the flavor that's there is on point. No tartness or crispness - not very fresh tasting. Sweet and timid enough that I would use it to sweeten a mix of other fruits without worrying much about it getting in the way. Not dry, but not really juicy. Very smooth, does not add any throat hit. Some body, with that mild flavor on top and a medium thick sweeter base, not too thin.

I really liked [Strap-On Aid](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/36886-strapon_aid) when I tried it six years ago, let's see if I still do. **TASK 9**

There are a bunch of apple bacco recipes and at least a handful of them use FA Stark Apple. The one that looks most appealing to me is this [Starkonja's Head](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/242084-starkonjas_head__apple_tobacco), mostly because it has serious, grown-up tobaccos in there and not just RY4 Double and Soho. **TASK 10**

**Strawberry (Red Touch)**

Fairly weak for FA. I call it the astronaut strawberry, not that I've ever had one, but it's what I imagine eating a freeze-dried strawberry would be like. It tastes natural, with that subtle earthy note that brings some realism to the party, but unnaturally dry. Not juicy at all. Top notes are mild, slightly tart, and the finish is weak but there's a solid middle that tastes like a semi-sweet ripe strawberry only without any juice. It's not the best standalone strawberry by far, but it is a great tool. Seems to work really well as part of a strawberry layer to make sweet candy strawberries taste more natural and fill out the middle more, despite not working so well by itself. Cranking it up too high that earthy note starts to get a little grassy, like freeze-drying that strawberry leaves and all.

No, I do not agree with those who say it smells like farts, and no, I'm not throwing away part of the [original Strap-On](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/6487-strapon) and many of the Strap-On variants. t's in more than half a dozen things on my to-mix list.

I also need it for [Lychee Blossom](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/61783-lychee_blossom), which is a fantastic lychee recipe that I love. **TASK 11**

And I want to try [Strawberry Whirl](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/296320-strawberry_whirl_by_mixalott) which is described as “layered strawberry jam, light fluffy cream on a whirl cookie.” It had me at OoO Strawberry Jam. **TASK 12**

[StrawMelon Melee](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/270237-strawmelon_melee) because I love cantaloupe and strawberry together and this looks like a great new cantaloupe-strawberry mix. **TASK 13**

[Custard's Last Stand](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/198299-custards_last_stand) because I'm very interested in how that WF Sugar Cone fits in there. **TASK 14**

[Daveberry Cheesecake](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/115618-daveberry_cheesecake) because it's named after me! **TASK 15**

[Yuno](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/196755-yuno) because it looks like a great strawberry milk and I'm really interested in the combination of WF Macadamia Nut and OoO Cream Milky Undertone it uses. **TASK 16**

**Strawberry Green**

That's what it tastes like, underripe strawberry. Very green like you can taste the chlorophyll, and pretty tart, but very clearly a strawberry, and has some syrupy sweetness. It tastes like a small amount of it could do amazing things with other strawberries, like making them taste brighter and more refreshing, maybe making a flat sweet candyish strawberry taste more like the real thing.

Pretty excited to try things with this one, already have a couple planned. [Mike's Peach, Strawberry and Vanilla](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/271526-mikes_peach_strawberry_and_vanilla) looks like a winner, too. I'm really interested in the combination of WF Strawberry Gummy Candy and FA Strawberry Green for the strawberry and even more interested in the combination of FA Peach White and SSA Nectarines for the peach. **TASK 17**

**Summer Clouds**

I'm not sure who started calling it FA Dryer Sheets, but I can confirm that is an accurate description. It's supposed to be peach and rose, it think, but I get a hint of peach and a whole lot of dryer sheets. **TRASH 3**

**Tiramisu**

There's a really nice ladyfinger cookie buried in here, and accurate cocoa notes, but unfortunately nothing resembling mascarpone flavor or richness, and even more unfortunately, it's all soaked in, not liqueur-spiked espresso like it's supposed to be, but booze-free coffee brewed by a skunk who had recently sprayed skunk spray and burned some popcorn in the same kitchen where he made the coffee. **TRASH 4**

**Torrone**

As best I can tell it's actually accurate to a certain type of Italian nougat that contains lemon zest, almonds, pistachios, vanilla, sugar, honey, and egg whites. I've never had that, but it pretty much tastes like what I imagine all of that stuff mixed together might taste like. It's sweet and creamy and nutty and lemony all at the same time. I'm not personally a huge fan of this mostly because the lemon feels weird in there and it seems a bit busy, for a single flavor, but it's not terrible. It's a little on the thin side, but just a little; there's still enough body there to pull off a sugary creamy texture. The nuts aren't distinctly almondy or pistachio tasting and more of a generic nuttiness.

Need it for [Stag Night](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/14834-stag_night), also interested in trying [The Key To Happiness](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/93998-the_key_to_happiness), described as “a nice piece of store bought key lime pie like you find in the freezer section of your local grocery store. **TASK 18**

**Up**

This one is so odd. It's coffee, cream, and... cereal? I don't know why there's a bakery flavor in there. It's coffee forward and that coffee is not terrible, it's kind of burnt but not dark, like a light roast coffee that's been on a warmer too long or at too high a temp. There's a little milky cream that makes an appearance and then there's some bakery that is, for whatever reason, supposed to be a cereal. I guess it's cereal? It's kinda dry and gritty, almost graham cracker like. It finishes on that note and I'm not sure what you're supposed do with that other than use this to add a coffee note to a bakery recipe, or get really creative. No skunk spray or burnt popcorn or anything like that, so above average for a coffee flavor, but also nothing I want to mix that uses it. **TRASH 5**

**Vanilla Bourbon**

Thin, natural-ish and darker but not quite spicy vanilla. Really very plain to my taste, Rick calls it warm and a little floral. I'm not getting any warmth or floralness, it tastes more like an attempt at vanilla bean that doesn't quite get there but is more of a bold natural vanilla than a lot of other offerings. There's a richness or depth to the vanilla flavor, but not to the concentrate itself, it's actually rather thin, it will most likely will not add the perception of creaminess or thickness that many vanilla flavors do.

Three or four things I've planned to mix use it. Here's two more: [Premium Vanilla Custard](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/251678-premium_vanilla_custard) - obvious from looking at it that it's going to be delicious. I see you, OoO Marshmallow. **TASK 19**

And [Shunsui Kyoraku](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/251955-shunsui_ky%C5%8Draku). I'm scared of the WF Egg Yolk in there, but not too scared to give it a try. **TASK 20**

**Vanilla Cookie**

tTis is a very vanilla cookie. Loads of baked in kinda bright but not overly bright vanilla taste. Also, pretty buttery. There's a nice cookie there in the middle of that butter and vanilla. Without steeping, the cookie is just a little too sharp (nutty, overcooked, pyrazine) for my taste, but it vapes smooth overall with all that vanilla and butter. If it had just a little less pyrazine sharp overcooked nuttiness (and I'm told it does have less of that with a longer steep than the five or six days I gave it before sampling 2.5%), it could get fairly close to a Golden Oreo type of thing.

I already have at least 10 recipes I'm going to make that use it, but also:

[3 2 1 Stroopwaffel](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/244526-3%EF%B8%8F%E2%83%A32%EF%B8%8F%E2%83%A31%EF%B8%8F%E2%83%A3_stroopwaffel) I don't know how accurate that will be, but I love VT Honeycomb and looking forward to seeing how SSA Crisp Waffle and FA Vanilla Cookie mix with it. **TASK 21**

And [Makoto Shishio](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/276517-makoto_shishio), because I love the idea of an “oreo waffle with cream filling." **TASK 22**

**Vanilla Ice Cream**

Milky, plain base, not custardy at all - more like gelato. Darker vanilla. I don't love it, simply as a matter of personal preference and liking a richer style of ice cream, but there's nothing wrong with it. I've got at least recipes in line that use it, and here's one more that stood out: [Lemon Gelato](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/191182-rugly%E2%80%99s_lemon_gelato_). Looks refreshing and satisfying. **TASK 23**

**Vanilla Tahity**

This is every bit as much an almond flavor as a vanilla flavor, I get more almond than vanilla. It even has a bit of a cherry-ish note to it the way some almond flavors do. It's like sweet almond-vanilla-cherry, or amaretto and marzipan. It's a bit dry, but there's fluffy marshmallow-like body to it, and it's not dry enough to be unpleasant. I actually kind of enjoy vaping this as a single flavor. The hint of cherry is similar to the hint of cherry in amaretto, not a medicinal plastic cherry. The vanilla is very bright and artificial, like the vanilla in a vanilla coke, not a coke with vanilla syrup added like at a soda shop or Sonic, but just the vanilla from a can of vanilla coke.

Already planning to keep it long enough to mix one custard recipe that uses it, now I have two more things to try:

This recipe for [Vanilla Crescent Cookies](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/301367-vanillekipferl_weihnachtspl%C3%A4tzchen_%F0%9F%8E%84_) looks wonderful. **TASK 24**

And I'm really interested in the combination of VT Creaming Soda and WF Cotton Candy Jelly Bean in this [Blue Balls](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/247884-blue_balls) recipe for blue raz and vanilla hard candy, even if I think FA Vanilla Tahity was probably not the best vanilla for the job. **TASK 25**

**Vienna Cream**

Absolutely requires a steep, not just to come into itself, but to not be disgusting. It's weird how much better this gets after steeping for just about 4 days. Freshly mixed, it tastes like someone tried to make spiked eggnog and substituted nail polish remover for rum. After a short steep, it tastes like a very sweet, light dairy cream, on the thin side of creams but still very much a cream. with a bit of bright vanilla and an interesting sort of ice cream-like crispness to it. Very smooth, clean tasting. Have found it sometimes works when other creams don't, just takes a little patience.

I need it for four of my all-time favorite recipes, Mango Beauregarde, Notorious, Vurve's Vanilla Almond Milk, and Vanilla Cronut.

Gotta try [The Worlds End](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/306959-the_worlds_end_), too. It looks like too much TFA DX PB for the profile - banana nut bread with chocolate sauce - but looks delicious, regardless. **TASK 26**

New Flavor Count: 2,429

Just a short one this time, to get back in the groove. I went on vacation, brought COVID back as a souvenir, and have had a bunch of work to catch up on because of all that. Will finish off the Flavour Art next week.
