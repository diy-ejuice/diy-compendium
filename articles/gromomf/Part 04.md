Anyone want to watch me play TASK or TRASH again?  

# TFA

**Butter**

Way out of order as far as the spreadsheet goes. I reserve the right to do this from time to time. Or even all the time. I’ll take requests to do it if you have a certain flavor you want to see tasked or trashed.

TFA Butter is coming up now because it’s used in DJ Mills [Golden Oreo Pudding](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/37647#golden_oreo_pudding_by_deejay_mills). Golden Oreo Pudding came up because I went on a nostalgia tangent while contemplating BF Chocolate Truffle way back in Part 1. Yeah, I’m just finishing up trying the stuff I mixed for Part 1. This was the last one before I start tasting things from Part 2. Such fond memories of Golden Oreo Pudding, from four to five years ago. Now? My blood runs cold, angel is a centerfold, na-na, na-na-na-na
na-na-na, na-na-na-na

*Black Fucking Pepper: An Odessey.* I once loved TFA Vanilla Bean Ice Cream and felt deep pity for those unable to enjoy it due to detecting a black pepper note in it. Then one day while I was messing around with TFA White Chocolate, I noticed a peppery taste. Thought it might be my nic at first, but it wasn't. Soon I tasted it in TFA Vanilla Bean Ice Cream and then TFA Vanilla Custard, then TFA Butter, and eventually even Liquid Barn’s Vanilla Ice Cream. I had been cursed, ruined.

I used to think TFA Butter was an excellent butter, but now tastes weirdly peppery to me. Like, it mostly tastes like real, thick, rich, heavy basey butter, but there’s a weird spicy black pepper edge to it. And all it took was 0.35% of it to ruin Golden Oreo Pudding, and I’m guessing it’s taken a bunch of other DJ Mills recipes off the table for me as well. FUCK. **TRASH 1**.  

# BAKER FLAVORS

**Vanilla Sponge Cake**

I tried [The Safer Twinkie](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/15244#the_safer_twinkie_by_thadentman) to see if it could convince me to keep BF Vanilla Sponge Cake. It didn’t. Not that it isn’t tasty and if not a spot on Twinkie, at least Twinkie adjacent, with the only real flaw being a hint of lemon. I have no doubt that this was the best Twinkie recipe that could possibly have been concocted... six years ago... without using FW Yellow Cake. Also no doubt a better one could be devised out of new flavors. Starting with VT Sweet Cream, which tastes like straight-up Twinkie filling to me. I’ll revisit Twinkie profile later, since a realistic Twinkie recipe is something I think I’d really enjoy. For now though, it’s enough to rule out Vanilla Sponge Cake as the key to that and toss it in the **TRASH 2**.  

**Wald Meister**

It’s actually pretty tasty! It’s like cherry, vanilla, cinnamon, and ??? I’m not sure what that fourth thing is, but it’s kinda like the smell of hay. I’ve never baled hay, but I did briefly have a job walking beside a tractor that was pulling a trailer and loading freshly baled squares into the trailer. There was a hay scent in the air and that’s what this tastes a little like, cherry vanilla cinnamon hay. But a little greener, more herby. With the cherry, vanilla, and cinnamon being most prominent, with just a little herby hay in the background, the overall flavor reminds me of Something like store-brand cherry vanilla Dr Pepper. I’m not exactly sure what I could or would do with it, but I’m sure it could be tasty in a tobacco recipe. If I’d found a single recipe that uses it I’d probably give that a chance. But, I could not, so this neat little flavor is bound for the **TRASH 3**.  

**Wodka**

Other than being a little too sweet from the VG (probably nothing a little FA Bitter Wizard couldn’t fix), that really tastes like vodka. Like the worst bottom-shelf plastic bottle vodka you ever poured into a barrel of trash can punch in college. Beyond McCormick, we’re talking Popov-quality here. Skol maybe. Aren’t Baker Flavors from Russia? You’d think they’d know a thing or two about vodka flavor. If I ever had an interest in vaping vodka-flavored juice, I don’t anymore after tasting this. **TRASH 4**  

**Chocolate Truffle**  

Revisiting this. During part 2, I unceremoniously dumped the last of my Amoretti flavors, and now the only Baker Flavor left standing is Chocolate Truffle. It will remain standing, for now.

I want to get rid of my BF Chocolate Truffle, but things need to happen first. One, I need a chocolate RY4 style recipe as satisfying to me as [Raven](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/73078#raven_by_id10_t). So I set out to make one. The first version was a disaster. Spicy. Why the hell is it spicy, none of those ingredients are really spicy. Also, maple, something like licorice, and way too much vanilla. Couldn’t even taste the chocolate, and the tobacco was muted/weird. It was only successful in not tasting like coconut, which was a concern given the FLV Chocolate Deutsche I used in it. I will need to start all over again. Aaaand there’s another two-week steep **TASK 1**

RAVEN 2 v2

All FLV

Flavor | %
---|---
RY4 | 2
Red Burley | 0.75
Kentucky Blend| 0.25
Milk Chocolate | 0.25
Chocolate Deutsche | 0.75
Butterscotch | 0.75

Also in the process of deciding what to do with BF Chocolate Truffle, I tried [G’s Thin Mint](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/24377#gs_thin_mint_by_chrisdvr1) and it convinced me that I also wanted to make sure I could make Girl Scout Thin Mint profiled vape without it. Rather than trying and failing and trying again to make my own, I’ll start by trying JBird’s [Skinny Mint](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/6997#skinny_mint_by_jbird). I’ll be subbing JF Cookie for the FA Cookie, which I threw away in Part 3. **TASK 2**

# BICKFORD

**Cream Soda**

Very similar to VT Creaming Soda. Not exactly like any cream soda I’ve ever tried, but close. Vanilla is very middle of the road. It’s a little thin, but still kinda creamy. Top notes have some powdery taste to them that isn’t quite soda bubbles, but close enough to the creamy head you get on a mug of cream soda or root beer. Of note, it’s very sweet. At 2.5% it didn’t really make a super sweet impression, but my other sample (5%) made me think there is probably some sucralose in the flavor itself. Obviously not an outrageous amount, but it’s a bit sugar lippy. It also picks up a touch of some indistinct citrusy taste at 5% that I hadn’t noticed at the lower concentration.

It’s certainly a better Cream Soda than the TFA one. If it weren’t for VT Creaming Soda being so similar only a bit better (richer, deeper), I’d keep this. **TRASH 5**.

**Eggnog**

Very nutmeg forward with just a little realistic eggnog flavor behind it, so the balance is off, and although the eggnog flavor is in there, the richness isn’t. But those aren’t the biggest problem. The real problem is even after steeping for two weeks this is harsh as fuck. I can’t vape this. Had testers at 2.5% and 5% and tossed the 5% away without even opening it because 2.5% was so painful. **TRASH 6**.

**Fig**

Revisiting this. I don’t remember why my friend told me to try this at 10% but maybe it was his way of saying he’s not my friend, after all. It was awful. So much worse than it was at 2%. It’s like dirty old grape candy washed in grandma’s rose perfume. Also harsh. **TRASH 7**.

**Guava**

Pretty gross. Identifiable as something that was intended to taste like guava, but harsh and floral tart top notes sit on a base of nearly rotten guava with a hint of cat pee. **TRASH 8**.

**Pumpkin**  

Update on this one, my “September Ends” experiment (3% FLV Virginia Tobacco, 2% Bickford Pumpkin, 1% FLV Apple Filling) turned out pretty tasty. And it will be very seasonally appropriate here in about three weeks. But is it worth putting up on ATF, encouraging others to track down and buy Bickford Pumpkin, or even keeping Bickford Pumpkin in the collection? Nah. If I have a hankering for something like this I’ll just mix the real Cabin recipe and not a slightly floral knock-off.

**TRASH 9**. And that’s the last of my Bickford flavors, no more buying Bickford for me.

# CAPELLA

**Churro**

It tastes like a sweet cinnamon-glazed donut with a little play doh in the dough. The cinnamon is interesting. It’s light and sweet and kind of a cinnamon sugar glaze, not the same cinnamon that’s in CAP CDS, which would actually be better for a churro. What’s beneath that doesn’t get the heavier, chewier texture of a churro - it’s more smooth and airy like a donut and it does taste fried like a donut-- but it tastes to me like it’s been laced with play doh. Not everyone gets play doh out of CAP Glazed Donut and if you’re someone who enjoys that flavor you might like this one as well, but I just can’t get over that play doh flavor. And there isn’t really anything out there using it that has a big bright flashing neon mix me sign on it, so it’s **TRASH 10**.

**Cinnamon Danish Swirl**

I’ve used it in recipes anywhere from 2% for a hit of cinnamon all the way up to 6% for the main ingredient in a doughy Danish/roll thing, and tried recipes with it all the way down to 0.5% for the lightest touch of spice, but CDS usually gets used at around 3%, where you get bakery cinnamon on top of a sweet, rich, buttery, doughy, pastry. Not really accurate for a flakey Danish, more like a cinnamon roll dough, but not anything weird in it. The only off-notes I get from it is a bit of metallic tinge in the cinnamon, almost like the metallic iron tinge you get in blood, and it’s very slightly sour.

I would love to chuck this, but I need it to make [Pheasant Ridge](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/64553#pheasant_ridge_by_fear), which I will do like, right now. **TASK 3**.

I would also need to be able to make a Snickerdoodle Cookie vape without it.

I found one that looks really good, [CV Snickerdoodle](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/242560#cv_snickerdoodle_by_chainvapor), but if it isn’t everything I’d hoped for, I’ll have to create my own. **TASK 4**.

**Cinnamon Sugar**

It tastes like CAP cinnamon - the same cinnamon in Cinnamon Danish Swirl, Graham Cracker, and Horchata - but with a bland yet sweet base. If that sounds good to you, go for it. If you're afraid it will taste metallic, like blood or coins, maybe don’t. It tastes fine to me, definitely not as metallic as Cinnamon Danish Swirl but if I think about it too hard, I can start to get the the pennies thing. Slightly powdery but not much other texture. Not really granulated sugar, more like the stuff all over those cinnamon-flavored powdered sugar donuts. Dry.

Not perfect, but does a pretty solid job of sitting right on top where you’d want a cinnamon sugar to sit.

Keeping this. Thinking about, what if that Snickerdoodle recipe isn’t the one and I do have to make my own? Might as well start that process, just in case, and CAP Cinnamon Sugar will have a role in it, at least in the first version.  

Snicker At my Doodle V1 **TASK 5**

Co. | Flavor | %
---|---|----
CAP | Sugar Cookie | 4.5
CAP | Cinnamon Sugar | 2
WF | Cookie Butter | 2
FA | Vanilla Cookie | 1.25
FW | Sweetener | 0.5
FLV | Rich Cinnamon | 0.1

Hoping to get all the vanilla I want and crisp up that cookie a bit with the FA Vanilla Cookie, but if it doesn’t work, don’t be surprised to see a future version with that broken into two different flavors, possibly CAP Vanilla Custard or a similarly rich vanilla and JF Cookie.

**Coconut**

Very weird. It tastes like a bright vanilla marshmallow cream mixed with fake coconut flavor. There’s a very nice sweet creaminess to it and a full-bodied, velvety smooth mouthfeel, it’s just half vanilla marshmallow half coconut and the coconut that’s there is pretty fakey, bordering on suntan oil.  
The only thing keeping this out of the trash right now this that I still haven’t tried this [Black Hole Currant](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/182705#black_hole_currant_by_parad0x357) recipe that became a task in Part 3 because of the Black Currant. Should the fate of two whole flavors rest on just one recipe? Probably not. So I’ll add [Deez Dragon Nuts](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/261981#deez_dragon_nuts_by_mixnjuice) by MixnJuice to the **TASK 6** list.

**Cola**

That is not good. Warm, generic cola syrup, thick and sweet, but with a weird chemical off note that makes it taste like a flat store-brand cola laced with some kind of cleaning product, pledgy. Yep, that’s what it is, there’s some lemon to it, which isn’t super out of place for a cola which should have some citrus, but this is like a pledgy lemon. Also a touch of cherry in there. **TRASH 11**

**Concord Grape with Stevia**

THE JAM. I don’t usually like stevia in vapes because it’s sweetness comes at the price of a bitter, sort of vegetal bitter, aftertaste that doesn’t sit well with me. But I’m only getting the slightest bit of that with this and the rest of the flavor seems like it might be worth it. It’s not a full natural grape and it does suffer from what seems to be the curse of grapes, not being very assertive, but it tastes not like candy and instead very much like a dark, sweet grape jam. Easily the jammiest grape. Could probably use some help from another grape to push it forward on top. But that jammy grape body is on point.

This flavor is essential to mixing the Foment masterpiece [Gruber Grape V2](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/193593#gruber_grape_v2_by_foment_life), but that was more of a once in a lifetime experience, just to know that something I once found extremely very difficult - making a truly excellent Peanut Butter and Grape Jelly Sandwich vape, *could* be done. Not to say I didn’t vape it all up, but I’m not sure I need to do it again.

What I need is another delicious CAP Concord Grape recipe, and since I already know it works with PB, I’ll give this [Wolfwheeler PB-Grape Taffy](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/270432#shigeo_kageyama_by_wolfwheeler) a try. **TASK 7**

**Cool Anise Bliss**

CAP calls it “A perfect blend of berries and tropical fruits with a menthol and anise twist.” Tastes like light menthol and strong anise upfront, more emphasis on the tropical fruit, just a hint of nondescript berry in the background. Tropical fruit tastes mostly like pineapple, plus something a little more funky than just pineapple, maybe a touch of mango. Thick, saturated body on this one, but more fleshy than syrupy. It’s not a very strong flavor and tastes at 3% like it could be pushed up a good bit higher, like 5 or 6%, but to what end?

If I thought I might want/get to sell one-shots at Chef’s again, I’d keep this. It seems right up their alley with the anise and menthol. I don’t. It’s going in the **TRASH 12**.

**Cool Mint**

Liquified Tic Tacs? I’m not a huge fan of Tic Tacs so it’s been a minute but that sweet candied peppermint plus a touch of menthol with a good bit of vanilla definitely reminds me of them.

It’s not that there’s anything wrong with it, it’s just that there isn’t really anything out there I feel compelled to mix that uses it, or a profile I want to attempt that would likely need it. Other flavors have all my mint needs covered. **TRASH 13**.

**Cranberry**

That’s just not very good. It doesn’t really taste like cranberry, although I guess it does taste more like cranberry than any other fruit. Also, it’s a little medicinal or perfumy on top of that deeper, sweet almost-but-not-quite cranberry darker red fruit flavor.  Also, it’s oddly a bit on the thin side for something so sweet. I want my cranberry flavor to taste like it’s going to cure a UTI. This doesn’t. I want to throw it away, but CapiaDiy and Gordo are standing in the way with their [Cranberry Lemonade](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/282142#cranberry_lemonade_by_capiadiy) and [Winter Snowflake](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/182661#winter_snowflake_cookies_by_gordo) recipes. **TASK 8** and **TASK 9**

Edit: [Also This](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/xb48n7/getting_rid_of_most_of_my_flavors_part_4/io29dxk/) **TASK 9.5**

Both of those use it in combination with FLV Cranberry, which is where the real cranberry flavor would be coming from. I probably would have used FLV Cranberry with just a touch of FA Pomegranate or something like that to back it up. Maybe CAP Cranberry is the best backup for the FLV Cranberry. Only one way to find out.

**Creamy Yogurt**

I don’t care for yogurt vapes. I can appreciate how good of a job someone did making one, but the idea of vaping yogurt creeps me out a bit, for lack of a better explanation. It’s not something I’m trying to convince anyone of, it’s just the way I feel. So that’s where I’m coming from.  

Tastes like yogurt, like plain Dannon yogurt. It’s heavy and thick-ish, it’s dairy, it’s got just a slight sour twang to it. It’s not rancid. Add some sweetener and fruit and it could be a Go-Gurt. I don’t find it to be especially “creamy” though, it is creamy, but it’s just a bit chalky as well. Like yogurt laced with just a little chalk dust. It is a little bit cheesy; it might be good in a cheesecake or as a cream cheese stand-in.

It turns up in small quantities in quite a few recipes that aren’t yogurt vapes, so before tossing it just for being a yogurt, I went looking to see if there were any of those that gave me FOMO.

Found it in this [Key Lime Pie](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/273955#kay_loim_poi_live_mixing_by_enyawreklaw) by enyawreklaw. Usually I don’t mess with “live mixing” recipes, they seem at best unfinished. But that one looks too good to pass up. **TASK 10**
And then there’s [this recipe](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/148934#pina_papayaloupe_aka_not_a_mango_by_brewdog_kilo) which contains no mango flavors but boldly claims “If you like Mango, you will definitely love this.” I like mango! **TASK 11**.  

**Crunchy Frosted Cookie**

My biggest beef with this flavor is the “Crunchy” part of the name. Ain’t no crunch here.

It’s a cookie, but extremely soft and piled high with violently artificially flavored/very slightly chemically frosting. It’s not offensive-tasting to me, but I’m a little offended by them putting “crunchy” in the name. There’s no crunch or snap, nor even any grit or grain. It’s a kind of a cookie, but like one of those nearly flavorless extra soft Lofthouse cookies from the grocery store. Not homemade. Not even slice-and-bake - no human hands have ever touched this cookie. Also like Lofthouse, so much frosting. The frosting tastes very sweet and fluffy and just a little bit weird. Like you can almost taste the food coloring in the frosting.

I’m not sure what I could do with this but it might work as a base for a funfetti cake recipe or as an accent to a birthday cake ice cream recipe. But even in either of those scenarios, it’s going to need another bakery to give it a little more texture.

Couldn’t find any recipes I just had to make with it. It’s going in the **TRASH 14**. There are other options for this kind of really bright frosting anyway, like CAP Frosting, and if you want another excessively commercial frosting just with a light touch of soft bakery behind it, CAP Vanilla Cupcake V2 fits the bill.  

**Cucumber**

Fairly authentic, not as much as FA or FLV cucumbers, but still, definitely a cucumber and not fake-tasting. Not too sweet, very juicy and refreshing, mild peel note upfront. Nothing odd or offensive. Does have some fullness or body to it, enough to use as a base to build on. Soft-textured.

I could always use more juicy and refreshing juice. Couldn’t immediately think of a recipe that I need it for, but I might come up with one in the near future, and in the meantime, this [Punched Guava](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/226992#punched_guava_by_krawacabana) recipe that uses a little of it looks awesome. **TASK 12**  

**Custard Cake**

Really yummy. It wasn’t what I was expecting, which was CAP Vanilla Custard mixed with CAP Yellow Cake or CAP Cupcake. It’s not far off from the yellow cake, but the “custard” isn’t really custard at all, it’s like a good milk, plus some vanilla. Kinda reminds me of Tres Leches cake. Very rich. Pretty sweet. The vanilla is bright, not CAP VC vanilla or CAP French Vanilla. More like a touch of that CAP Simply Vanilla that’s super bright, but just a touch of it.

I’m not feeling like I need CAP Custard Cake in my arsenal at the moment, but that’s probably because I haven’t had a chance to see what people have done with this relatively new flavor yet.

Since tasting it made me think of Tres Leches cake, I was pleased to find a couple of recipes that went in that direction. I’m missing a couple of ingredients for [This one](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/260862#adc_all_day_cake_by_lonesomerhodestn) and have serious concerns about using that much SSA Clotted Cream in anything anyway (barf).

Similar concerns about the amount of SSA Whipped cream in [this one](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/280072#tres_leches_by_kylezkloudz) as well, but that flavor is really only a problem for people who are really, really sensitive to things with any butyric acid in them at all. And I still have all the ingredients. I’ll give it a try **TASK 13**

Also have all the things for this [Lemon Pound Cake](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/260774#lemon_pound_cake_lpc_by_kenowhere), which looks tasty, so I’ll give that one a try as well. **TASK 14**

**Double Apple**

Sweet-tart, bright, and juicy authentic apple. No off notes. I think the “double apple” concept is supposed to be both red and green apples in one flavor. I can sort of see that - a red apple peel upfront and more of a green apple body. But I don’t quite get that level of separation from it. There’s a bit of red apple peel upfront but it’s fairly subtle. It’s more of a floral peel than a spicy peel, but without that grassy or very tart peel of a green apple. Lots of body and a bit of mealy? I guess apple texture. Surprising from CAP, I was expecting something more syrupy and candied but this is more authentic. At the same time, it’s subtle enough that it could lend some of that body to other fruits, like watermelon. Because the red apple peel is on the soft side and green apple body doesn’t have a strong flavor, I don’t quite get that level of red-green separation from it, it’s more like a one of the more tart varieties of reddish pink apples, like pink lady or a jazz apple. Not sweet as a Fuji apple, more tart and crisp than red delicious, but not too crisp to be mixed into a cooked apple scenario. It tastes like a very useful flavor.  

Unlike a lot of flavor profiles, which have a bunch of bad options and few good ones, there are a bunch of great apple flavors. It’s difficult to narrow it down. In the end, Double Apple mostly makes the cut because I need it in case I want to mix some more [Water Malone](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/53215#water_malone_live_mixing_summertime_recipes_by_enyawreklaw).

I don’t want to do that right now, and you can’t make me. But I do want to try this [Citrapple Soda](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/157699#citrapple_soda_by_staybert). So far, Staybert + Soda = Yes. **TASK 15**

**Double Chocolate V1**

That doesn’t actually taste like chocolate at all. It’s not even chocolate-adjacent.  I’m not sure what it tastes like. Nonspecifically fruity, dirty like actual dirt, and a little plasticky, all at the same time. It’s an abomination. **TRASH 15**

**Double Chocolate V2**

Much better than V1, similar to TFA Double Chocolate but better that, too. Actually tastes sort-of like chocolate, like a fake chocolate sauce made out of melted Tootsie rolls and heavy cream. Nice thick creamy feel to it, flavorful, the chocolate is just fake-y. Also darker than a milk chocolate.

I don’t think this Double Chocolate V2 is going to make the cut, there are better chocolate choices. For most things, at least. But I’ll give a few recipes a chance to change my mind before chucking it. It certainly is a popular flavor.

[The Snickering](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/271842#the_snickering_by_lukeloop) **TASK 16**

[Chocamisu](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/226271#chocamisu_by_azzer) **TASK 17**

[After 8](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/194544#after_8_by_vensyboy) **TASK 18**

**Double Watermelon**

The more realistic of the CAP watermelons, but not realistic enough to completely shake off the artificial or candy taste. It has some issues. For one, it has a strong rindy taste that almost pushes it into cucumber territory. It’s definitely not a fully ripe watermelon, although it is kind of juicy and wet.

I really enjoyed [Boys Love Melons Lemonade](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/142457#boys_love_melons_lemonade_by_humanpuck), but not enough to keep Double Watermelon on hand to make it. There are plenty of other ways to make melon lemonade without it, I’m sure. And I didn’t see anything else using it that I just *had* to try. **TRASH 16**  

**Dragon Fruit**

Same sweet white gummy bear flavor that a lot of dragon fruits flavors do. Some slight standalone harshness that I know is easily mellowed in a mix. A floral leading edge that’s somewhere between honeysuckle and hibiscus, with some raspberry. Not sure that it tastes more like actual dragon fruit, but the floral thing does make it taste a bit more like something that came from a plant rather than a candy. There’s some dryness with those florals and it doesn’t have that creamy-type mouthfeel of TFA Dragonfruit, but it’s a rich, vibrant, full flavor.

My initial reason for having CAP Dragon Fruit was to try to clone a commercial juice called Milk of the Poppy. I’m certain that there's CAP Dragon Fruit in there, along with CAP Sweet Strawberry and CAP Vanilla Custard V2, but there’s more than that and I’m not sure what it/they are and I’m no longer interested in that project, anyway. Didn’t see anything else I desperately wanted to make out of it, either. **TRASH 17**.

**Energy Drink RF**

Flat Red Bull or RockStar mixed with a shot of pink wine, with some ABC Bubble Gum floating in it. It has that Red Bull-ish “sweet tarts melted in acid flavor,” but doesn’t have that acidic bite or any sort of fizzy anything. It’s more syrupy sweet without any kind of bold flavor, it’s soft, soft like a flavor that’s been muted with too much ethyl maltol. Trying it higher than I did at 6% might help, but I doubt it from experience dealing with that sort of muted soft flavor. I’m guessing here but I think turning it up will probably cause it to get more dry and less syrupy. There’s a hint of rose wine to it but it’s not nearly as blatantly grapey as TFA’s Energy Drink. Instead of that Juicy Fruit chewing gum hint that I get from some of the other energy drink flavors, and to a lesser extent from Red Bull itself, there’s a solid hit of pink bubblegum in the base here. There’s not anything I’d call a glaring, grotesque off-note and it is sort of pleasant, not really nailing what I think it should taste like but still passing for a generic energy drink type of flavor.

Quite a few better options for energy drink flavors, plus no recipes I’m interested in that use it? **TRASH 18**  

**Fig**

Tastes a bit off of the real thing, yet yummy. It’s dark, like a dark berry, with a good amount of what tastes like prune juice. A little funky. But has some brighter elements upfront like fresh plum or white grape. Still not quite the fig I’d mix with tobacco because of those brighter notes, but seems like it would be a great addition to darker fruits, especially grape, blackberry, blueberry where the syrupy sweetness it has might make those seem more jammy for something like dark fruit jam.

There are better options for both fresh and dried fig, but this [Go fig-ure](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/26440#go_fig_ure_by_chrisdvr1) recipe interests me, and not just because of the photo. **TASK 19**  

**French Vanilla**

Top tier French Vanilla. It’s CAP Vanilla Custard without the custard, basically. It’s still rich and full, but the buttery/oily and eggy notes are missing. I really like TFA French Vanilla Deluxe better, but this is more what I have in mind when I think “French Vanilla.” About the only thing I would add is that if you’re tired of CAP Vanilla Custard because you vaped too much of it, this might not be the flavor for you. It’s very identifiable and some would even find how familiar it is to be distracting. But it’s very full, thick, rich, and creamy with lots of a darker almost caramel- or-butterscotch like sweetness, and a little bit of milky flavor. It’s really very much like just drinking French Vanilla coffee creamer. Definitely a lot of body here and deep and bold vanilla flavor.

I need this to make more of Fear’s [Budderstotch](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/35021) and might skip a few tasks to jump straight to doing that as soon as I post this. OMG it’s so good. **TASK 20**

But wait... there’s more.

I’m going to run out of French Vanilla mixing all these...

[French Vanilla Cheesecake Cupcakes](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/61729#french_vanilla_cheesecake_cupcakes_by_fleming). An older recipe but man, if that doesn’t look good. My only concern is the CAP Cake Batter at 2% which is just about where it starts to get a little weird. **TASK 21**

[TOC’s White Fluffy Clouds](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/197071#toc_s_white_fluffy_clouds_by_tocmichellehughes), I’m predicting Zen in my mouth and maybe another recipe that gets made more than once. **TASK 22**

[It takes two to Mango](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/252417#it_takes_two_to_mango_developed100_by_stevetc) by Steve TC, a recipe that looks like it was designed to get my attention. **TASK 23**

[Cream Cheese Strawberry Cream](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/276084#cream_cheese_strawberry_cream_by_atomik13). I thought I was on my way out of the S&C vaping business, just vaped too many of the damn things over the years to the point that even the great ones are yawn-inducing but this is begging me to mix it. **TASK 24**

**Fresh Pineapple**

I think this is my new favorite pineapple. It’s got all the flavor of CAP Golden Pineapple and then some, and they did good in calling it fresh, since the Golden Pineapple has always tasted kinda stale. This is bright and juicy. And very natural. Not getting any off notes, and I hate when my pineapples taste oniony. I do think it could stand to be a little bolder than it tastes at 4%, maybe bump it up a little, but at 4% it’s not candy. It’s just a fresh juicy pineapple.

I may have to redo a few of my recipes using CAP Fresh Pineapple instead of a combination of INW Pineapple and another pineapple or two.

Starting with [this one](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/195140#iyslpc_by_id10_t)

Another Pina Colada Recipe V1 **TASK 25**

Co. | Flavor | %
---|---|----
CAP | Fresh Pineapple | 5
WF | Coconut Custard | 1.25
FA | Coconut | 1
FA | Jamaican Rum | 1
BCF | WS-23 (30%) | 0.5

I don’t imagine this will be the final version, if there’s one thing I’ve learned about trying to make Pina Colada vapes, they can be difficult to balance.  

**Frosting**

It’s garbage, and I love it.

You know how iced animal cookies taste better than plain animal cookies. This is the difference between those, in a bottle. While I still prefer more “adult” frosting flavors, the kid in me is jazzed about this one. It’s like the super bright sugar sweet frosting on a cookie rather than a buttercream cake frosting. Like just scraping the icing off a couple dozen mass-produced cookies and eating just that, all of it, at once. Sugar rush city. Especially the lingering sweet frosting aftertaste. Bold flavor, probably going to show up well in a mix.

Nothing out there I’m itching to try that uses it, yet, though.  Fine then. I’ll start with a

Basic Frosted Sugar Cookie V1 **TASK 26**.

Co.| Flavor | %
---|---|----
CAP | Sugar Cookie | 5
CAP | Frosting | 4
JF | Cookie | 1.5
WF | Cookie Butter | 1.5

**Fruit Circles**

Doesn’t taste bad, does taste like a fruit cereal, but doesn’t really taste like spot-on Froot Loops. Maybe some kind of Dollar Store knock-off Froot Loops, or maybe what would happen if you mixed Froot Loops, Trix, and Fruity Pebbles together into some kind of fruit cereal Frankenstien. Accurate sugar-glazed grainy cereal base, mix of citrus and berry fruit flavors, smooth, almost creamy down low as if it’s supposed to be cereal with milk, but doesn’t completely sog the cereal.

I wouldn’t mind some fruity cereal vapes. I’ll try a couple and see whether one is so good that I can’t get rid of CAP Fruit Circles.

[Basic Loops](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/98832#basic_loops_straight_up_fruit_loops_by_westcoastclouds). I’ll be adding that 2% FA Meringue. **TASK 27**

[Loopy Cake](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/190699#loopy_cake_by_lukeloop). **TASK 28**

**Fuji Apple**

I don’t want to keep it. I’d really like to scale back this ridiculous collection of apple flavors.

Does taste like a Fuji apple in that it has that mix of tart and sweet and it’s not bad by any means, but it does have some issues to be aware of. It’s not super flavorful in comparison to other apples, it’s a soft flavor. Bottom-heavy without a bold top note. But, it’s sweet and juicy, and might be a good option if you want a sweet and juicy background apple or even just a fruity background flavor without that sharper, bolder flavor that many other apples have. It also has some thick nice body that others don’t, mealy, kind of gritty like real apple flesh. No peel note, not much tartness to speak of, but very sweet. Seems great for filling out another apple or any fruit mix really, especially if you want a fruit juice type of thing. Just like apple juice is used to fill out so many of those. I’m not sure it’s going to work in a bakery without making it soggy and not adding as much discernable apple flavor as you probably want in a bakery.

This [Ultraviolet](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/261001#ultraviolet_grape_caprisun_by_ninedimensions) grape Capri Sun profile looks like the way I’d be most inclined to use it, though I’m surprised only half a percent makes much difference. And [Kaitain](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/63873#kaitain_a_dune_based_recipe_by_kindground) was a very good recipe that made it work in a pipe tobacco scenario.

But the thing that’s gonna make me keep it - at least for now - is wanting to try Concrete Rick’s [Midnight Marauder](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/83580#midnight_marauder_ejm_x_chef_s_one_shot_by_concreteriver) **TASK 29**

**Gingerbread**

Love this flavor! It has a lovely bakery ginger spice note with a rich, sweet, cakey body, that’s a little buttery. It’s delightful. Similar to CAP Sugar Cookie but a bit drier. It’s  too light in the sense that it’s a dark blonde when it should be a brunette. It needs some really dark brown sugar/molasses-type flavor to finish it out into a gingerbread, and a little more crunch for something like a gingerbread cookie or gingersnap. But it’s delicious and super useful just the way it is.

I need it to make [Titanic](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/48608#titanic_by_id10_t), but we already went over that with the CAP Apricot.

The best trick for darkening it that I’ve encountered has been in this [Mjuk Pepparkaka](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/206522#mjuk_pepparkaka_by_wallebiela), but there are other recipes I want to try now, starting with this one: [Pumpkin Cookies](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/209523#pumpkin_cookies_interactive_mixing_developed_by_developed) **TASK 30**

**Glazed Donut**

Play Doh. That’s literally just Play Doh, or less salty and maybe a little sweeter than Play Doh but pretty much Play Doh. And I have eaten enough Play Doh in my day to know. This is great for a kindergarten nostalgia vape. It is not a donut, I don’t even see how it would be helpful in crafting a donut vape. Gross, useless, **TRASH 19**

**Golden Butter**

Very slightly sweeter than butter, artificial butter flavor but not offensively artificial, it’s not gross or blatantly movie theater popcorn fake butter. More like that “I can’t believe it’s not butter” or Parkay “buttery spray” 0 cal squirt butter stuff. (Yes, I’m on a diet, why else would I even know what that’s like). Golden Butter similarly tastes thin for butter, almost watered down. It’s smooth but flat, not adding any real basey thickness to the vape.

I immediately wanna toss it for being a pretty inferior butter but it’s been used in so many recipes that I get a little FOMO from the idea.

This [Butterscotch Krimpet](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/143065#butterscotch_krimpet_by_daytimefrank) was yummy and Golden Butter fit perfectly there, for example.

But when I looked though a couple hundred of them, the only one that jumped out like TRY ME was Kopel’s [Butter Cookies](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/28626#butter_cookies_by_kopel). Looks yummy AF, right? Counterpoint, it’s a 5-year-old recipe and you can’t convince me that newer ingredients wouldn’t make an even better butter cookie. WF Cookie Butter FTW. My CAP Golden Butter days are behind me. **TRASH 20**

**Golden Pineapple**

So much like canned pineapple tidbits that maybe it’s my imagination but I swear I can taste a bit of the metal can in there. Sweet and free of bad off-notes unless you count that tinny sort of metallic thing, but tastes... not fresh. Think pineapple tidbits left out on a buffet for hours, like for a salad topping. Thick and deep, great for adding body to more watery pineapples like INW Pineapple at a lower dose, but a little harsh at single-pineapple %s like 4 and up and best used as a backup in the 2% or less range. Of note, lack of freshness seems like it could be a feature rather than a bug if the goal is a cooked pineapple.

There have been a TON of awesome recipes that have made terrific use of Golden Pineapple, I’m not going to list all the ones that look good to me or that I have tried and confirmed are good. Instead I want to focus on out with the old, in with the new.  Capella’s own Fresh Pineapple blows it away. I’m already working on updating a pina colada recipe to use Fresh Pineapple instead of a combination of INW and VT Sugarloaf Pineapple. But I can’t actually get rid of Golden Pineapple until I know I can also make a great [Mango Colada](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/12259#mango_colada_by_id10_t) without it, so it’s time to start working on that.
