TASK OR TRASH - Each flavor gets assigned at least one task or it goes in the trash.

## FLAVORAH

**Connecticut Shade**

People say it tastes like cigar wrapper leaf and based on recipes I've tried, I can definitely see that. As a single flavor I get dark tobacco with a strong but good coffee note and hints of cocoa and anise.

I need it for [Abuela](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/47894#abuela_by_fear). Mango cigar. A classic, created by a legend. **TASK 1**

I also need it for [None More Black](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/63181#none_more_black_by_chemicalburnvictim), but that went on the task list last week. Out of curiosity, I need to see for myself how TFA Rice Crunchies works in [Jo's Juice](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/134875#jo_s_juice_by_beeker). Goodness, those notes make me miss AlfredPudding, our shooting star. I really hope I didn't have a hand in chasing him away by showing everyone that picture I found of him blowing a cloud on some chick's cooch. **TASK 2**

Here's Rice Crunchies in another ‘bacco recipe: [salvete luciferum](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/267947#salvete_luciferum_by_chumbles). Is this some forbidden knowledge I've stumbled upon in my search for other uses for Connecticut Shade? BTW notes for this are in Latin and mean “Praise be to the highest, to our dark prince, he who casts true light upon man's lies and faith.” **TASK 3**

**Cookie**

Doughy, not even really a cookie. No crunch at all, doesn't even really taste baked, more like cookie dough. Full thick mouthfeel, rich. I also get a strong and slightly weird maple-off note.

I think it sucks as a cookie, but as a useful ingredient? We'll see. It's in a couple of things I already plan to try. I'll add:

[TOC's Don't Vape This](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/222599#toc_s_don_t_vape_this_by_tocmichellehughes). Looks gooey. **TASK 4**

**Cookie Dough**

Pretty accurate. Tastes very much just like a piece of slice and bake sugar cookie dough. Even has that grainy yet wet, kinda greasy feel it it. I do get a slight hint of maple, which I would consider an off note, but not a yucky one. It's kind of harsh though, and not a lot of fun to vape all by itself. I know that can dealt with in a mix but is pretty throat-hurty standalone. Definitely full-flavored at 1%, could probably go even lower. I did not go lower, but just for “fun” I tried it a bit higher. This was not actually fun. Don't do this. It's a throat assaulting greasy maple nightmare. I've heard of people getting chocolate from this? I think they're off their rockers. I get nothing resembling chocolate from this whatsoever.

I looked at a bunch of recipes but the only one that really tempted me is [No, You're A Dirty Cookie](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/229393#no_you_re_a_dirty_cookie_by_eyemsam) **TASK 5**

**Cool Menthol**

Highly potent menthol, at least twice if not three times as strong as the usual 10% menthol dilution. But just menthol, nothing special about it other than the potency.

I'm not a big menthol guy but I can appreciate it, especially if my seasonal allergies are acting up or my palate needs a hard reset. This [Frosted Tourmaline Sky](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/82274#frosted_tourmaline_sky_week_1_by_jenniferjarvis) recipe looks worth a try. **TASK 6**

And I could wind up regretting this, but [F'n Ice](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/165028#f_n_ice_by_dragonlady) looks like it might be self-flagellation in a bottle, and I deserve that. **TASK 7**

**Cotton Candy**

This one isn't just the usual ethyl maltol 10% and call it cotton candy. It kinda tastes like marshmallow-flavored cotton candy. Tastes like mostly ethyl maltol but there's other stuff going on in here. It's a little more sugary-feeling and sweeter, and it's not nearly as dry. There's quite a bit of vanilla in it as well, and it's a little smoother, softer, and fuller than just EM, but still with lots of that spun sugar taste. The vanilla makes it tastes like a cross between cotton candy and a marshmallow. Not harsh at all.

I want to try this [Gilded Oreo](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/232314#gilded_oreo_by_nickevz) recipe that uses it. **TASK 8**

**Cranberry**

Tastes like straight up Ocean Spray Cranberry Juice to me. A little tart, but also quite sweet, like cranberry juice drink with other unidentifiable fruit juices behind it rather than pure cranberry juice or fresh cranberry, which would be extremely tart and even a bit bitter. Smooth and juicy. Not top heavy at all, has a juicy base and some body. Some people talk about an unpleasant earthy or dirty off note with this so I looked for it and really can't find it, though it tastes like it could go that way if cranked up really high, like beyond 3%.

I need it for a couple of long-time favorites: [1-2-3 Cranberry Sprite](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/86917#1_2_3_cranberry_sprite_by_id10_t) **TASK 9** And the Crazberry Crack that I'm already planning to mix again soon. It's also in a few recipes already on my must-try list, [Cranberry Thumbprint Cookies](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/208509#cranberry_thumbprint_developed_by_developed), for example.

And I just found three more irresistible-looking mixes:

[Purple Tart](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/288126#purple_tart_by_mullas). Tart with cranberry and blueberry topping, it's the use of FW Fluffy White Cake that has me salivating. **TASK 10**

[Alucard](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/206747#alucard_by_wolfwheeler). Powdered donut filled by Wolfwheler with cranberry jelly. **TASK 11**

[Cranberry Butter Pecan Pie](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/149460#cranberry_butter_pecan_pie_by_besejuiced). Bet that tastes like Thanksgiving in a bottle, minus the drunk racist uncle. **TASK 12**

**Cream**

I get a very velvety smooth, mildly sweet cream. Good body and weight about being custardly heavy, slight dairy taste, not clearly vanilla but something like vanilla. 1% seems to be the sweet spot for me, but anywhere from 0.5 to 1.5% works. Any higher, it starts to get a little harsh for some reason. Some people also report a weird funky or spicy off-note with it, I can't find that.

There was a time when I wanted to use this like Franks Red Hot - put that shit in everything. It's in some of my favorite recipes that I've created, such as [Mango Blossom Macaron](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/46330#mango_blossom_macaron_by_id10_t), and favorites made by others, such as [Pheasant Ridge](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/64553#pheasant_ridge_by_fear), and at least a dozen different things I'm already planning to mix. It's not going anywhere, ever. I'm not going to comb through 500+ recipes looking for new FLV Cream recipes to mix. Instead, I'm going to task myself with trying to update a couple of recipes I made with it a long time ago that I can no longer enjoy because TFA Vanilla Bean Ice Cream and to a lesser extent, LB Vanilla Ice Cream, taste like pepper to me now. Used to vape so much of those two flavors that I wonder if pepper-tasting is the result of some kind of cumulative overdose of certain DAAPy vanilla ice cream flavors.

Longing ‘23 - V1 **TASK 13**

| Co. | Flavor            | %   |
| --- | ----------------- | --- |
| FLV | Cream             | 1   |
| FA  | Cream Fresh       | 1   |
| INW | Shisha Vanilla    | 1   |
| TFA | Honeysuckle       | 3   |
| WF  | Vanilla Ice Cream | 1   |
| SSA | Ice Cream Vanilla | 0.5 |

Original Recipe: <https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/31323#longing_by_id10_t>

Just hoping those small amounts of WF Vanilla Ice Cream and SSA Ice Cream Vanilla will make up for taking out the 1.5% TFA VBIC.

Cherry Belonging ‘23 **TASK 14**

| Co. | Flavor            | %   |
| --- | ----------------- | --- |
| FLV | Cream             | 1   |
| TFA | Cherry Blossom    | 4   |
| LB  | Pink Lemonade     | 1.5 |
| CAP | Lemon Lime        | 0.5 |
| WF  | Vanilla Ice Cream | 3   |
| TFA | Vanilla Swirl     | 2   |
| SSA | Ice Cream Vanilla | 1   |

Original Recipe: <https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/54852#cherry_belonging_by_id10_t>

WF Vanilla Ice Cream, TFA Vanilla Swirl, and SSA Ice Cream Vanilla to make up for taking out 5.5% LB Vanilla Ice Cream, plus just a touch of CAP Lemon Lime to push the citrus. I'll probably wind up adding some sweetener to both of these as well before they're finished, possibly even some cooling, but for now I just want to see if they're even going to work.

**Cream & Cookies**

So according to Flavorah, this is supposed to be Cookies & Cream Ice Cream (or non-trademark infringing ice cream with Oreos in it). That sort of jives with it being mostly a very sweet and bright smooth cream flavor, with just a hint of Oreo-esque chocolate, but I'm missing some of the richness and depth of an ice cream and the Oreo is a bit lacking. It tastes more like a whole lot of Oreo cream filling with just some errant flecks of Oreo cookie mixed up with it. Not really getting any of that crunchy grainy cookie body. One-on-One and Real Flavors really bring the Oreo in a way Flavorah does not. I really want to toss it and would, but that fuckin Sorteal....

[O's Vanilla Pudding Pie](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/255282#o_s_vanilla_pudding_pie_by_sorteal) **TASK 15** Edit: fixed a bad link to this one

[Cookies N' Pudding](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/270129#cookies_n_pudding_by_sorteal). **TASK 16**

Worth noting that both of those use the One-on-One Oreo in addition to FLV Cream & Cookies.

**Creme De Menthe**

This is not an authentic creme de menthe flavor but I love it anyway. It's such a rich, smooth full-flavored creamy mint that's a pleasure to vape standalone or in a recipe. The mint is somehow both bold and subdued by the sweetness and creamy mouthfeel. It's much too thick and full for an accurate representation of Creme de Menthe and doesn't have the boozy kick of a liqueur; instead it has a solid dose of sweet chocolate in there. It's like you tried to skin a Junior Mint but couldn't get all the chocolate off.

I need it for JBird's [Skinny Mint](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/6997#skinny_mint_by_jbird) and/or my attempt to slightly update that, as well as for [Mint Chip Cookies and Cream](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/117147#mint_chip_cookies_and_cream_by_shyndo), and a couple of others already on the list to try.

A couple more to try:

[Creamy Vanilla Mint Ice Cream Cone](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/254169#cvmicc_a_creamy_vanilla_mint_ice_cream_cone_by_spdrjrslm). Doesn't that look amazing? It really is SPDR week. **TASK 17**

[AF8](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/259717#af8_by_vensyboy) there are quite a few Andes-type recipes and at least a couple of them are already on the list. I like the simplicity of this one. **TASK 18**

**Crunch Cereal**

**TRASH 1** Very emphatically, unequivocally, TRASH. It tastes like breaded & fried mushrooms, sprinkled with a little brown sugar and then left out overnight to get extra gross. The mushrooms being breaded in a corn-based cereal is closest to accuracy as it gets, but it's overwhelmingly mushroomy and having “crunch” in the name when it's clearly mushrooms that have been left out overnight to get all soggy and have no crunch left at all just makes it worse, and the little bit of brown-sugary sweetness just makes it even worse than that.

**Cucumber**

Am I crazy or is this flavor salty? I mean, it's not like super salty, but it's just as salty as FLV Beer Nuts. Seems like the perfect cucumber for like one of those cucumber-flavored Gatorade or energy drink situations, which have a lot of sodium in them. All the electrolytes. Also seems like it might be the cucumber for savory type situations, like if you wanted to mimic cucumber with greek yogurt because you're a wonderfully weird individual. Aside from the saltiness, it's pretty middle of the road compared to other cucumbers I've tried, which is actually a good thing, like the best of a number of worlds. Vividly authentic with a little peel note but not too much peel. It's a little mushy and not quite as clean, crisp, and bright as I'd like but it's not nearly as mushy as TFA. Maybe a little sweet in a melon rindy way because of the VG, not a bunch of weird sweetness. It's got some body, too. Some depth. A little dry, in comparison to other cucumber flavors, probably owing to that lingering saltiness, but not dry compared to non-cucumber flavors. It's actually a pretty neat flavor, but I'm not really feeling motivated to create something out of it and as far as things others have made, these tasks are getting out of hand. So, goodbye FLV Cucumber. **TRASH 2**

**Cupcake Batter**

It tastes like a maple-vanilla cake pop. It tastes more like vanilla cake icing than cupcake batter, but it has some bakery notes, which is why I call it a cake pop, those things are cake crumbs mixed with icing. Sweet and sugary like icing. It's a little oily like cake batter, which could be off putting for some, but accurate, and could also be read as the hydrogenated soybean oil in a tub of store bought icing. I also get a maple note from it that has not been reported by everyone who's tried it (YMMV). 4% tastes like a maple cake pop, just loaded with imitation maple. At 2% I don't really get a maple syrup taste, and the vanilla comes out more, but it also tastes a little thin and under flavored. 4% is a lot more filled out, but just so much maple. So there's bound to be a sweet spot in between there around 3% where it works best, as a main flavor. But even at 4% it's not really very thick and satisfying like you expect cake batter to be. As an accent/frosting to some other kind of cake thing though, sure, why not? It's not a bad flavor, but this is called "Getting Rid of Most of My Flavors," not "Keeping Almost All of My Flavors." I'll be fine without it. **TRASH 3**

**Cured Tobacco**

Fairly generic and dry cigar filler-type tobacco. Extremely versatile. Kinda boring on its own but mixes really well with so many other things. It especially loves to fill in the gaps in other tobaccos. Depending on how much is used and what it's mixed with, I sometimes get a bit of a cedar-type woodiness, and using too much can also get a little soapy, so if those notes wind up in a mix with it, maybe use less in the next version.

It's in some of my all-time favorites, such as Abulea and Budderstotch, both of which I'll have already mixed recently when I get this far down the list, and a couple more that I won't have had in awhile:

[Long Gone Lonesome Blues](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/106454#long_gone_lonesome_blues_blueberry_creme_brulee_tobacco_by_lonesomerhodestn) **TASK 19**

And [Southerner](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/58127#southerner_by_kopel). **TASK 20**

It's also in a few I'm super excited to try:

[The Hinterlander](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/46122#the_hinterlander_by_kopel) **TASK 21**

[Knives](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/215134#knives_by_wolfwheeler) **TASK 22**

[Legacy](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/268542#legacy_by_davidn2kl) **TASK 23**

[Burleyscotch Root Beer](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/298498#burleyscotch_root_beer_by_kuri_santou) **TASK 24**

[Butterscotch Tobacco](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/283820#ry69_butterscotch_tobacco_by_amouthforwar) **TASK 25**

**Custard**

By itself, it's mildly unpleasant to me. It tastes like I'm vaping dry buttermilk powder that desperately needs to be reconstituted. You get the flavor of buttermilk but it's thin and dry without any creaminess or thickness. I know from trying some recipes that it can be a fine ingredient and possibly even work in a place nothing else would, but I'll be fine without it. **TRASH 4**
