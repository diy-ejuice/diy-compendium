TASK OR TRASH - Each flavor gets assigned at least one task or it goes in the trash.

#Liquid Barn

**Qwik**

Liquid Barn gave me this one-shot by DIYorDIE, and I never got around to trying it. Will do the recommended 15%. **TASK 1**

**Rainbow Sherbet**

Compared to other sherbet flavors, mediocre I think is a good word for it. Possibly even delightfully so? Some harshness, not perfectly smooth, but light in flavor. Not enough flavor to make it worth the rough edge as a single flavor at 6%, but used lower in a mix, could work in a sherbet or candy recipe. Mostly orange, clearly some other citrus as well but the orange really stands out to me as a bright, sweet, candy orange, but not a strong or punchy one. There's some berry in there as well, LB calls it raspberry and I guess it does taste like a raspberry, but more like blue raspberry candy than real raspberry. There's some creaminess to it but not quite the density of a sherbety creaminess or any real dairy flavor. Bottom line LB Rainbow Sherbet doesn't taste bad, but just is not very flavorful to me. They suggest 8%, I did 6% because I've found those recommendations by LB to be a little on the high side. Maybe I should have just pushed it up higher, but might get intolerably throat-hitty.

[mlNikon's Shurb Cupcake](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/235692-mlnikons_shurb_cupcake) is a little temping, but it seems like it would be be better with a better Rainbow Sherbet flavor (Molinberry, maybe) and I can live without trying it. **TRASH 1**

**Red Delight**

Doesn't exist anymore. **TRASH 2**

**Strawberry**

It's a little harsh for me. Why would a strawberry need to be harsh? None of the other strawberries are harsh. But other than that, it tastes like a combination of mostly candy strawberry with some more natural ripe strawberry flavor, like a strawberry candy that makes an attempt to taste like a fresh strawberry, and is very full bodied and deep. It has some sweetness to it but isn't cloying. A little tartness, too, maybe that's why it vapes a little throaty for me. If mixed with something smooth and creamy that might counter that, I wouldn't hesitate to mix a recipe that calls for it. FWIW, I don't remember anyone else saying they found it to be harsh.

Couldn't find a recipe I need to try that uses it. Probably because there are just too many other, better, strawberry flavors. **TRASH 3**

**Strawberry Cheesecake**

It's not a proper cheesecake. It doesn't have any crust at all, but it's also not even really a crustless cheesecake. But it certainly beats all of the other strawberry + cream type of flavors I've tried, with its balance of bright, strong candied strawberry and heavy, buttery cream. The sweetness is more in the strawberry and the cream lacks both the sweetness and that dairy tang of cheesecake, it's more like just like sugar-sweetened smooshed strawberries dipped in heavy cream.

I've already got Kittybit's 1-2-3 Strawberry Cheesecake Fluff slated to try and coming up soon.

This is a really great flavor, so there's a lot more where that came from.

[1-2-3-2-1 Strawberry Jam Cheesecake](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/155138-12321_strawberry_jam_cheesecake) - based off the aforementioned Fluff, but looks even more-ish. **TASK 2**

~~[1-2-3 Baked Strawberry Cheesecake](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/132335-1_2_3_baked_strawberry_cheesecake) - another simple strawberry cheesecake recipe. **TASK 3**~~

[Strawberry Jammy Cheesecake](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/270930-_strawberry_jammy_cheesecake_) - a more complex strawberry cheesecake that had me OoO Strawberry Jam and OoO Vanilla Custard Cheesecake (I'll use JF Cookie in place of the FA Cookie that I've tossed). **TASK 4**

[Drizzled Strawberry Cheesecake](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/171392-drizzled_strawberry_cheesecake_cream_____glazed_jam_new_york_yes_we_sweet_) - that PUR New York Cheesecake is great stuff, and combining it with LB Strawberry Cheesecake, OoO Strawberry Jam looks like a slam-dunk. **TASK 5**

And [Morning Moo Juice](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/96948-morning_moo_juice__you_can_find_the_recipe_pack_at_bull_city_flavors), a recipe for classic strawberry-banana-orange breakfast smoothie by Juicefairy. **TASK 6**

**Sweet Lovin**

I don't think this exists anymore so I don't want to waste my time on it. **TRASH 4**

**Sweet Pipe Tobacco**

Doesn't taste like any type of tobacco I've ever tried or heard of. It's kind of a very sweet cherry wood flavor. It tastes like the distilled essence of the difference between cherry wood and some other type of wood you might BBQ with.

I don't hate it, but I also don't need it. **TRASH 5**

**Sweetener**

Pretty sure this is just ethyl maltol, at about the same concentration as in TFA Cotton Candy. Since I have a big bottle of TFA Cotton Candy, I don't need this also taking up space. **TRASH 6**

**The Man**

If I remember correctly, this was a boring and bland strawberry cream. Yawn. **TRASH 7**

**Tobacco**

Tastes like the LB Sweet Pipe Tobacco, which tastes like cherry wood, plus clove, which is not an improvement. **TRASH 8**

**Vanilla Cream Tobacco**

Kinda tastes like you dropped a vanilla pudding pop in dirt. Very earthy. Doesn't really taste like tobacco. Vanilla is like a middle of the road vanilla, not too bright, not too dark. **TRASH 9**

**Vanilla Ice Cream**

Let's talk about pepper-tasters. Long ago, when people first started saying that TFA Vanilla Bean Ice Cream (and a few other flavors) tasted like black pepper to them, my first theory was that it was maybe like the cilantro soap gene. That certain people could not have a certain combination of flavor concentrate components because it would taste like pepper to them for genetic reasons. That turned out to not be the case. Although that was based on people saying it tasted like black pepper to them the very first time they tried it, it turns out that pepper-tasting is something you can develop over time, somehow. Or maybe it's contagious, I got too close to a pepper taster and contracted it.

So when I could no longer enjoy my once-beloved TFA Vanilla Bean Ice Cream because it started to taste like pepper, LB Vanilla Ice Cream came to the rescue... for a time. Then I got even more sensitive to whatever causes pepper tasting, and could no longer enjoy LB VIC.

Before it too began to taste a bit peppery, LB Vanilla Ice Cream was easily the next best thing to TFA VBIC. It was pretty similar - a vanilla bean frozen custard-type ice cream, with a spicy fresh cracked vanilla bean top note and a thick dairy cream base with some buttery notes. Not quite as custardy as TFA VBIC, but much sweeter than TFA VBIC, which was nice. Rich, creamy, silky smooth, full-mouthfeel, and just an excellent vanilla ice cream flavor. I've created a non-peppery substitute for LB VIC that works for me; hopefully that doesn't start also tasting like pepper someday. But, if you can enjoy LB VIC, you should, it's a great one if it doesn't taste like pepper to you. **TRASH 10**

**Vanilla Mint**

“Heavy spearmint with a vanilla accent,” to quote ConcreteRiver, is a solid reader's digest condensed description of this one. It's like smearing some vanilla frosting on one of those spearmint jelly candies that are shaped like bloated leaves, which IMO would be a great improvement to one of those things. The vanilla really provides a nice contrast here. Solid single flavor vape that also tastes like it could get really interesting with some dark berry flavor added to it.

I need it because I already planned to try [MBs Simple Springtime Elegance](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/91444-mbs_simple_springtime_elegance_diydownundermarchchallenge_).

Was disappointed to not see any recipes combining this with a dark berry so, fine, I'll make my own.

Berry Mint Candy V1 **TASK 7**

| Co. | Flavor                 | %   |
| --- | ---------------------- | --- |
| LB  | Vanilla Mint           | 5   |
| WF  | Wild Berry Gummy Candy | 2.5 |
| FLV | Jammy Berry            | 0.5 |

**Vienna Cream**

Whipped sweet dairy cream, relatively thin and light especially in the middle, Liquid Barn says it has a slight hint of cinnamon but I can barely find it. There's a bit of dryness like you might get with cinnamon but no real cinnamon flavor when vaped, at least for not me. I licked some of my 6% sample and could clearly taste the cinnamon so that's a little strange. Might want to use caution mixing a cinnamon flavor with it, might come out more cinnamony than expected. Bit heavier in the finish but still more of lighter whipped cream than a full-bodied cream flavor.

I don't know what 1% Vienna Cream is doing for this recipe, but I'll give [WCFP](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/76378-wcfp) a try because the other three ingredients look great together - LB White Chocolate Peppermint, Real Flavors SC White Chocolate, and WF White Fudge. **TASK 8**

**Watermalone**

This one-shot by DIYorDIE is supposed to just taste like real watermelon, with the apple in there being used to amp the fleshy texture. But, for me at least, the apple shines through too much. Tastes like someone spilled apple juice on my watermelon slice. Still, it's good. Good enough that my bottle of this is nearly empty (mostly from playing with using it as an ingredient rather than a one-shot as intended). Think I'm gonna just toss what little is left. If I want more, the recipe is available. **TRASH 11**

**White Chocolate**

Pretty underwhelming white chocolate. Barely tastes like anything at all. Creamy but missing the richness I'm looking for. **TRASH 12**

**White Chocolate Peppermint**

Delicious but really lacking in the white chocolate department. Needs some other white chocolate to punch that up if you really want white chocolate peppermint. On the other hand, if you just want a really extra creamy peppermint component, it's not too definitively white chocolately to be something else when mixed with other ingredients.

In addition to the just-mentioned WCFP and one other recipe already on my list, I'm going to try this [White Mocha Peppermint](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/177318-white_mocha_peppermint) - I'm intrigued by the use of FLV Irish Cream and a touch of FA Soho to make a mocha base. **TASK 9**

While we're on the topic of Starbucked up drink profiles, I'll also mix this three-ingredient [mlNikon's Mint Latte](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/128741-mlnikons_mint_latte). Again with the FLV Irish Cream. **TASK 10**

I'd love to try [WC Peppermintington Cookies](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/51359-wc_peppermintington_cookies), but I just can't do the TFA Butter anymore. Tastes like pepper now, even worse than LB VIC. Instead, I'll try [mlNikon's Peppermint Cookie](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/177811-mlnikons_peppermint_cookie) with JF Cookie instead of FA Cookie. **TASK 11**

Another bakery (ish) profile that uses it - [Twix a la Mint](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/253731-twix_a_la_mint) looks really interesting. Love that WF Crispy Wafer. **TASK 12**

I'm not sure about mixing strawberry with white chocolate and peppermint, but after seeing the four 5-star reviews I'll give it a shot. [White chocomint berry](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/228977-white_chocomint_berry) . **TASK 13**

[Dead Christmas](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/131433-dead_christmas_%F0%9F%8E%84_) is a neat-looking little recipe that just adds a TFA Cheesecake Graham Crust and a little CAP Vanilla Custard to the LB WCP. **TASK 14**

Finally, the one I'm most excited about, [WCP Ice Cream Redux](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/254702-wcp_ice_cream_redux). It's a bunch of ingredients and I usually shy away from having to pull a bunch of ingredients to mix something, but it looks glorious. **TASK 15**
