# INAWERA

**Dark for Pipe**

It has a weird chemical and caramel smell in the bottle that might throw off people who try to mix by scent but it's very different when vaped. Bold, sharp, earthy, darker tobacco, with hints of honey, dark chocolate, and vague dark fruit, moist overall, with some lighter, dryer tobacco in the background. Really nails the profile of pipe tobacco for me.

Already have four or five recipes lined up that use it. Found a few more I gotta try.

[Bottom of the Hill](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/113699-bottom_of_the_hill). I'm not 100% sure about mixing CAP NY Cheesecake, FA Meringue, and INW Marzipan with Dark for Pipe, but those are all good flavors, and I'm curious. **TASK 1**

[Old Tyme Pipe](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/296394-ole_tyme_pipe). Three of the "For Pipe" flavors - plus FA Soho and FLV Arabian. Looks great. **TASK 2**

[King of the Road](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/131791-king_of_the_road). Black and Dark for Pipe again, plus Gold for Pipe, Dirty Neutral Base, FLV Native Tobacco, and the nearly irresistible VT Honeycomb. YES. **TASK 3**

[Albertosaurus](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/269136-albertosaurus_). I hope I don't regret digging out nine flavors mix this, but it looks like it might be too good to pass up. “Tobacco caramel fig apple pie” is the profile. Ambitious. I'm here for it. **TASK 4**

**Desert Ship**

Spicy, dry, mild, cigarette tobacco. Although the spiciness is pretty prominent overall, individual spice notes are not very clear spice notes. I can kinda pick out anise and clove, and something sort of cinnamony as well. The tobacco itself is fairly Turkish-y light and mild. “Fruitiness” is specifically mentioned in INW's description of INW Desert Ship but I really don't get any fruit out of it. I do get a bit of dry caramelly sweetness and this might be too sweet overall for what some people are looking for in a tobacco. No ash.

This is a perfectly good spiced tobacco, but not one I can't live without. **TRASH 1**

**Desert Voyager**

Heavy honey note with some florality upfront, complex with noticeable licorice and lesser hints of leather and sandalwood. Doesn't really taste like tobacco but some dry, earthy, slightly nutty body that's similar to tobacco. I don't care for that sticky honey-licorice combo that's so forward in INW Desert Voyager but even if that's something that appeals to someone, it's not a great tobacco flavor as it would need some backup tobacco. 1% might be too much and that floral note might drop off lower, but it still mostly tastes like licorice dipped in honey and dirt. **TRASH 2**

**Dirty Neutral Base**

This is just ash. Just straight-up ash. Not specifically ash from tobacco. If FLV Commercial Cigarette is licking a dirty ashtray, this is something kinder and much less disgusting, like cleaning out your fireplace.

I need it for a few favorites, like Brigade 2506, Chem Twista Lime, Apricaught Me Slippin, and None More Black. All by Chemical Burn Victim.

And some more I plan to try (mostly by CBV). Here's one NOT by CBV, [Noir](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/267672-%E2%9A%AB_noir_%E2%9A%AB). I just know the combination of INW Black for Pipe and Vanilla for Pipe plus FLV Kentucky Blend and WF Bourbon Aged Cream is going to be good. And a little DNB probably won't hurt it. **TASK 5**

**Dragon Fruit (Pitaya)**

Easily my favorite dragon fruit flavor. It tastes like a supercharged version of the hibiscus-tinged white gummy bear pineapple-y peary candy that most dragon fruit flavors taste like. Very smooth at low concentrations, which is all you need, it's very concentrated. Also super dense and thick. Almost creamy.

I need this for a couple of favorites, both by Foment*Life: [Blue Eyes White Dragon](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/124392-blue_eyes_white_dragon) and [Chase the Dragon](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/146482-chase_the_dragon). Also need it for about a dozen recipes I have lined up to try. One more won't hurt, and [Inawera Shisha Berries and Cream](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/247071-inawera_shisha_berries_and_cream*) looks pretty tasty. **TASK 6**

**Elderflower**

I think this might be elderberry combined with elderflower. It has a dark “purple rose” flavor for a sharper, somewhat perfumy top note, balanced on top of a base that's significantly sweeter and fruitier, dark and earthy berry-like most like a blackcurrant, with some sweet apple-juice type flavor going on in the middle. A lot of depth and saturation here, complex and interesting flavor, very fruity.

There's a lack of recipes that use this and while I could probably help with that since it's not a “bad” flavor, I'm not feeling inspired by it. **TRASH 3**

**Eucalyptus with Mint**

I can barely find any mint in this, but it's strong eucalyptus flavor with extra menthololation. Herbal, camphor-y eucalyptus that's both warm and brutally cold at the same time. Very potent. Pretty much liquid Halls cough drops.

When seasonal allergies get the best of my sinus cavities, there's nothing better. I don't have a favorite recipe that uses it, though, I usually just eyeball 1.5% (this is a concentration that'll blow your sinuses out, not recommended for most people most of the time) and maybe add a little lemon. Things I haven't tried mixing with it, but will:

[Vanilla](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/152284-butter_menthol) **TASK 7**

[Grape](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/201918-aloe_you_vera_much_mr_grape) **TASK 8**

[Pink Guava](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/117231-guavalyptus) **TASK 9**

**Exotic Fruits**

Haven't tried this, will start with a 2% sample. **TASK 10**

**French Pipe**

Smooth, golden hay-like tobacco with a hint of vanilla and a touch of spice.

One of Fear's recipes that uses it was a recent addition to the to-do list. Here's another: [Posh](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/84832-posh) **TASK 11**

**Falcon Eye**

CBV said it mostly tasted like ginger to him; my theory is that his constant vaping of tobaccos mades it easy for him to pick out anything in a tobacco flavor that isn't tobacco. When I tried Falcon Eye, I got a sweet cigarette tobacco with a solid hit of spice, but while that spice tasted more like ginger than any other spice I could identify, it wasn't clearly ginger to me. It was weird, but nice. Oddly, INW calls Falcon Eye “tobacco with a hint of pear,” with no mention of ginger or spice. It did not taste like pear to me, but it did have a strong hint of that sort of earthy skin note that some pear flavors have, without the rest of the pear's pomaceous body and juicy sweetness.

I need this for my own recipe, [Falkor](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/129644-falkor) **TASK 12**

**Garuda**

A little grassy, appropriately dry, kind of tastes like a cheap little cigar. Very slight off note that tastes a little like ammonia at 2%, I would keep it lower than that.

Need it for a couple of recipes I've planned to try, and an old favorite that hasn't come up yet: [Smokin Hibiscus](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/105140-smokin_hibiscus). **TASK 13**

I'll also try [RY69 - Butterscotch Tobacco](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/283820-ry69__butterscotch_tobacco) - It had me at French Vanilla Deluxe. **TASK 14**

**Gentleman**

One of many peanutty tobaccos put out by INW. This one has a nonsense description to go with the nonsense name, “"It's got a class and something that makes everyone good in its company. Impeccable manners, perfect for posh and crowdy parties, but also great in a smaller group.” It's also decorated with a guy in a top hat... maybe that's a hint that a little Mr. Peanut is in there? It's also caramelly sweet and has a rich, toasty tobacco.

I don't have a recipe to mix with it but I'm not ready to toss it, either, because I have a hunch it will pair amazingly with banana.

Mr. Peanut's Banana Republic V1 **TASK 15**

"Is there anything more capitalist than a peanut with a top hat, cane, and monocle selling you other peanuts to eat?"

"We will coup whoever we want."

| Co. | Flavor                | %   |
| --- | --------------------- | --- |
| INW | Gentleman             | 2   |
| SA  | Banana Flambe         | 2   |
| TFA | Banana Nut Bread      | 3   |
| FLV | Native Tobacco        | 1   |
| WF  | Vanilla Ruyan Custard | 2   |

**Gingerbread**

Lots of ginger, not a lot of bread. Tastes like ginger after it's been baked into a bakery, maybe a little floral, but not much. It's mostly just really, really strong ginger, and the bready notes that are there are really light.

No recipes to be found, and I have other gingers. **TRASH 4**

**Godfather**

Have not tried. Not many recipes out there for it, but taken together, the ones I saw made it seem like 0.75% might be a good sample to start with. **TASK 16**

**Gold Ducat**

Tastes like spiced coconut rum and plain brown tobacco had a baby. It has been reformulated; the older one had more of a honey-like sweetness and was a bit darker.

I need it for the aforementioned Smokin Hibiscus and at least one other recipe in the queue. Here's a couple more that look fantastic:

[Gold Milk](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/220230-gold_milk). Syrupy! **TASK 17**

[Shisha Gold](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/206979-shisha_gold). It's just Gold Ducat, INW Shisha Vanilla and INW Custard, and a touch of sweetener. That's got to be good. **TASK 18**

**Gold for Pipe**

Lighter, more leafy tobacco. Dry, a little woody or at least woodsy, with a bit of a cinnamon-like spice kick to it. Not as moist as expected for a pipe tobacco but a nice tobacco for an oak-like woodsy note that isn't as dark as some of the other oaky tobaccos.

I need it for the aforementioned Old Type Pipe, King of the Road, and Smokin Hibiscus. Also a recipe or two ahead of those it in line such as Golden Boy by Max Savage, and an old favorite, Apricaught Me Slippin by CBV. Will also try [Garuda Cubano Way](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/148044-garuda_cubano_way). **TASK 18**

**Grapefruit**

Unmistakably grapefruit. Tastes pinkish. Tart with a tinge of bitterness but also some sweetness. No real serious problems with this one, but it's a bit too zesty at 2%. Seems like the zest wouldn't be overdone if the base were more filled-in. Instead it's a little thin. Not especially juicy, but also not dry, as the tartness makes it a little mouthwatering. Average throat hit for a citrus.

There's a grapefruit-pineapple soda recipe using it that I want to try and will be mixing soon. Also interesting, [Blushing Lady](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/175179-blushing_lady), which just adds FA Pomegranate and a little FE Lemon to it. **TASK 19**

**Grapes**

Everyone's tasters a little different, but on this one, they seem to be very different. So you'll see a lot of different notes on it. These are mine, but your mileage may very much vary.

It's one of the more flavorsome and less meh grape flavors, but weird in that it mostly tastes like sweet purple, and but with errant bits of real grape in there as well - a touch of tannic grape skin, some earthiness. Just enough to make it odd. Sweetness that tastes like white grape juice. Needs a lot of help to fully be either a real grape or a candy purple flavor. Without any help to either enhance those real grape elements or cover them up, it comes across like a mouthful of grape koolaid with some grapes in it, which is a bit odd.

You need it to try [Gruber Grape V2](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/193593-gruber_grape_v2). I've got three or four recipes in line that I need to try. But there are so many to choose from, I must've looked at 80 of them before selecting five more that are irresistible.

[Barragan](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/197438-barrag%C3%A1n) Grape Soda! **TASK 20**

[Distant Stars - Neutron Star](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/211447-distant_stars__neutron_star). I saw about three different recipes that use both FLV Guanabana (love!) and some grape flavors - what an interesting combo. Creator says “best mix I ever created.” **TASK 21**

[Panther Blood](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/151840-panther_blood). Really interested in that TFA Blackberry and INW Grape combo. **TASK 22**

[Green Blood Soda](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/183924-green_blood_soda). Contains elements of Panther Blood and Green Bastard, plus soda! **TASK 23**

**Gusto Mojito**

Weirdly tart spearmint gum. I don't get any identifiable lime out of this, just some strange tartness present in the background behind a spearmint gum flavor, and no rum, though it is very sweet. The mint is prominent and the gum base is light; it's less like a stick of gum than one of those chicklet type gums with more intense mint and more sugar and less gum than a classic stick of chewing gum. It seems like it might be possible to turn this into something like a mojito with the addition of some lime and rum flavors, but it also seems like there are easier and better ways to make a mojito vape. **TRASH 5**

**Gypsy King**

Have not tried this. I'll do a 1.5% sample. **TASK 24**

Also, got this specifically to try [Black&Mild Wine](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/55753-blackmild_wine), might as well go ahead and do it. **TASK 25**

_No Getting Rid of Most of My Flavors last week due to a death in the family and only a short one this week, same reason, but I hope to get back on track next week._
