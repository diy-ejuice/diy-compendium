TASK OR TRASH - Each flavor gets assigned at least one task or it goes in the trash.

## Capella

**Blueberry Jam**

Update: I tried [Le Croissant Mytrille and Citron](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/262735#le_croissant_mytrille_and_citron_by_warbstar) to help me decide whether I needed to keep CAP Blueberry Jam. It was a lovely blueberry + lemon croissant recipe, 5 stars. But then I compare it to [French Mornings](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/145323#french_mornings_by_kittybit) because I just tried that one recently, and how many dark berry croissant recipes do I really need? French Mornings has more can't-put-it-downness and if I had to pick one, it would definitely be that one.

I also made [Bang-a-Meringue](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/43714) to that same end. I thought it tasted good and did what it was supposed to do, but the best part of it was drowned in blueberry. Worth noting that my thoughts of this might be impacted by some lingering blueberry fatigue from all the blueberry things I tried near the end of my time on Noted. But the bottom line is that I tried two of the best-looking recipes I could find that used CAP Blueberry Jam and was not impressed enough to keep it around. **TRASH 1**

## DIY Flavor Shack

**Angel Food Cake**

Delicious, light, fluffy, airy, sweet. The only thing I'd say is off about it is that it's a little buttery; there's no butter in angel food cake. Room note is spot the fuck on. You could use this flavor to trick people into thinking you have Angel Food Cake in the oven, which is kinda mean if you ask me, but it's a thing that you could do.

Angel food cake with lemon cream cheese frosting? Sounds good to me! [Límónique](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/119132#limonique_by_sixstrings952) **TASK 1**

Unfortunately, this might be the last thing I ever do with it. The original Angel Food Cake has been discontinued. They've replaced it with a V2 but they have such a bad track record as far as V2's that replace great flavors not measuring up to the OG, that I'm not going to bother ordering it and couldn't recommend anyone else do that, either. So the next step after Limonique might be having to come up with my own angel food cake with lemon cream cheese frosting recipe.

**Banana Cream**

Very very similar to LA Banana Cream, which tastes like banana Laffy Taffy. I believe they used mostly LA Banana Cream to make this, but they've added some things to it to make it very slightly smoother, creamier, thicker, sweeter, and more mellow, with a hint of vanilla on the exhale. There's definitely some added cream in there, though I'm not sure which cream, possibly a very low % of some custard. If you don't like LA Banana Cream at all, you probably will not like this, but if you do, you probably will love it and consider it a slightly improved or refined version of LA Banana Cream.

How could I not mix [Exploding Cream Strap-On](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/36466#exploding_cream_strap_on_by_dodgerfog33)?! **TASK 2**

**Blueberry Muffin**

Excellent. Really tastes like a blueberry muffin. The blueberry is just a little brighter and less clearly baked in as the blueberry in FLV Blueberry Muffin, but it actually has real bready muffin base under it that's got a little thick richness to it.

There's a recipe on ATF, [BIG RED'S BLUEBERRY FLAPJACKS](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/209047#big_red_s_blueberry_flapjacks_by_bigred) that looks pretty decent, except for a few things. The main one being that TFA Vanilla Custard tastes peppery to me. I love some of the aspects of the recipe, though. I'm just going to have to make so many substitutions that it becomes a new recipe. I'll do that but if I ever post or share the recipe, I'll make sure to give Big Red credit both for the profile idea and for a few major pieces of the recipe.

BB (Pan)cakes V1 **TASK 3**

| Co. | Flavor           | %   |
| --- | ---------------- | --- |
| DFS | Blueberry Muffin | 4.5 |
| VT  | Bilberry Ripe    | 1.5 |
| CAP | Cake Batter      | 1.5 |
| VT  | Golden Syrup     | 1   |
| FA  | Custard Premium  | 1   |
| WF  | Angel Cake       | 1   |

That should do it!

**Cafe Coffee**

I think they discontinued this and never replaced it. Which really, really sucks, because I've suffered through a ton of shit-ass coffee flavors and this one was in the top 10 out of 40 or so. I don't know of a great recipe that uses it, though, and since it no longer exists, there's little sense getting attached to one now. I'm just going to toss it, sadly. **TRASH 2**

**Cafe Napoleon**

This one got V2'ed and that is a huge shame. It was in my top five out of like 40 coffees. Yeah, this is not going to be one I just throw away because I can't get more. It's more like a “use it til every last drop is gone and then break out the sackcloth and ashes” flavor. Tastes like a fresh cup of medium roast coffee very very overloaded with something like International Delight caramel-flavored coffee creamer. Coffee note is just plain no-frills coffee in the top notes, nothing anything off about it. Cream is not as heavy as real cream, kind of has that coffee creamer thing going on, not especially milky either, just flat cream that's heavily infused with caramel flavor, and lots and lots of that cream. Coffee comes back in the finish as just an accurately bitter coffee taste, then there's a lingering sweet caramel flavor. Other than needing some more coffee to be better balanced into something any normal human would actually drink, I can't find anything wrong with this or think of any reason not to use it anywhere where you want coffee, cream, and caramel.

Well, let's get to using it up, then.

[Holy Grail RY4](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/30652#holy_grail_ry4_by_dodgerfog33). This might have been the formula for the original Holy Holy Grail RY4, but few would ever know because the original Cafe Napoleon is no more. But, I still have some, so I'm about to be one of the few. **TASK 4**

[Gods Nectar](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/42138#gods_nectar_by_dodgerfog33). I'm pretty sure Cafe Napoleon _was_ a major part of the original Holy Holy Grail RY4. I just want to hold on to that magic as long as I can. **TASK 5**

[Morning Glory](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/84671#morning_glory_by_ruderudi). Some of this guy's recipes look really good and this one is definitely one of those. **TASK 6**

[And the Apple version of that](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/162814#morning_glory_apple_of_my_eye_by_ruderudi). **TASK 7**

**Choco Milkshake**

Have not tried, but apparently they no longer offer this, so I'm just going to **TRASH 3** it.

**Coconut Pound Cake**

It tastes like fake coconut flavor, butter, and vanilla, with a very small amount of cake batter-type flavor. Doesn't really taste cooked. I think you could probably “cook” it by adding some of something like a soft cookie, maybe CAP Sugar Cookie or CAP Crunchy Frosted Cookie, but then it'll probably still be like a pound cake flavored with fake coconut instead of having real coconut in a pound cake. **TRASH 4**

**Coffee**

Well, it's a bit weak, not a strong flavor even at 6%, and it's a little dry, like the kind of dryness that's common with flavors that just don't come across as being full saturated, but aside from that, it tastes like coffee with some sugar without any off notes. I don't see anything I want to make out of this so I'm going to toss it. **TRASH 5**

**Creme de Cafe**

Similar to their Cafe Coffee, but with a dairy cream finish instead of a weak, blank finish. Still dry at first where the coffee flavor sits and still not a very bold flavor even at 6%, rich but not very rich nonvanilla slightly sweet dairy cream, better with cream filling it in than Cafe Coffee. No off notes, just weakness and dryness. Another one I don't have anything to mix for, and no inspiration to try to come up with something on my own. **TRASH 6**

**Donut**

Appears to have been discontinued before I even got around to trying it. Oh well. **TRASH 7**

**Gooey Butter Cake**

This one's also been axed by DFS, so I'll ax it as well. There's a V2, but I'm not really interested in that. **TRASH 8**

**Holy Holy Grail RY4**

There's a mistake in my starting flavor count, as Holy Holy Grail RY4 was inadvertently entered twice on my spreadsheet. Maybe it's just so good it commanded two spaces. Rather than correcting the error, I'm going to make it right by ordering a new flavor, the Holy RY4 one shot from Flavor Jungle. **TASK 8**

It was going to have to happen sooner or later, because once the HHG RY4 I have is gone, it cannot be replaced. Flavor no longer exists, very sadly. I may cry into the bottle of [Cardinal](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/24962#cardinal_by_fear) I'm about to mix. **TASK 9**

**Holy Vanilla**

Another irreplaceable flavor that's been discontinued, which sucks because it is amazing. Or was amazing, I guess I should say. I'll be sad when it's gone but might as well go ahead and get that out of the way by mixing up some great stuff.

[Yellow Matter Custard](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/97838#yellow_matter_custard_dripping_from_a_dead_dog_s_eye_by_lukeloop) I've loved before and will love again. **TASK 10**

[Fitz's](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/67821#fitz_s_by_mrburgundy) is another one I'd like to enjoy one last time. **TASK 11**

[After the Party](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/29443#after_the_party_by_mrburgundy). I've wanted to try this for a long time, but just never got around to it. **TASK 12**

[PistachiOMG](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/148966#pistachiomg_by_staybert). Can't imagine I'll regret using a little of the last of my Holy V on this one. **TASK 13**

[Jazz Hands](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/54618#jazz_hands_by_kopel). I might regret this one, that FA Lavender can go sideways pretty easily, but I'm going to give it a shot anyway. **TASK 14**

[1-2-3 Van the Man](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/79281#1_2_3_van_the_man_by_deweysuds). Why not? **TASK 15**

**Lemon Pound Cake**

I've tried it, it wasn't super great, and now it's been discontinued and I have no reason to keep it. **TRASH 9**

**Pixie Stix**

Disgusting, and I couldn't find it on their site anymore, either. **TRASH 10**

**POG**

Brown sugar guava flowers. Deep, dark sweetness in there like brown sugar or caramel. I can't find any orange in there at all. I can't necessarily find any passionfruit here either, but there's something floral. It's not like the passionfruit floral edge though, it's deeper and darker and tastes more like a violet. It's not any more tart than something like CAP Sweet Guava can be said to have some tartness to it. It definitely tastes like guava, but that dark sweetness makes it tastes more like a cooked guava .An odd flavor and strange thing to label POG, but not unpleasant. If the floral can be mixed around, might use it in a guava jam scenario, or lean into the floral with some FA Violet and do some kind of purple tropical floral concoction.

At least this one still exists, but it's too odd for me to really want to try to figure out exactly what to do with it. **TRASH 11**

**Pound Cake**

Another one that still exists!

But, it tastes like burnt, weird buttery vanilla bakery. It tastes like you tried to cook a pound cake at way too high a temperature and burned the outside while leaving raw batter in the middle, then turned it inside out. Top note is just a very buttery and rich, sweet vanilla cream, then way too much AP to the extent it tastes beyond just baked or nutty and into sharp and burnt, like the edges of a tortilla chip left in the oven too long so that's black and little bitter. Thought this might be over-flavoring at 4% so I took it down to 2%. It's much less offensive down there but still pretty much tastes the same. As a pound cake, I think it's garbage. As an ingredient, I think you could probably use it at 2% just like you might use 1% TFA Acetyl Pyrazine, if you also want some butter, vanilla, and creamy sweetness in addition to the AP. I don't want that, though. It's just too much APness. **TRASH 12**

**Red Passionfruit**

Dirty tropical hairspray at 2%. Pure hairspray inhale, I wanted to spit it out but of course it's vapor so there's not really anything to spit. Exhale has some earthy, musky tropical fruit notes along with the hairspray, but I couldn't tell you whether it's passionfruit, guava, mango, it's just like this vaguely tropical ripe fruit aroma added to hairspray. Could be over-flavoring making it taste like hairspray but the underlying vagueness does not make me feel motivated to dilute and try again. **TRASH 13**

**Yellow Mango**

It is not good at all. Cleaning product off note on a dry, sort of dirty or dusty mango flavor that otherwise tastes a bit like a Mango La Croix. Combination of chemical and dirty notes, yum! **TRASH 14**

## DuoMei

I only have a few of these in very small bottles and it's too much of a pain to obtain more, so it won't be long before they're all in the trash. But will I throw out mostly full bottles now or empty bottles later? That depends on the flavor.

**Luzon Mango**

I just threw away Reka Sexy mango for tasting like this last week. This tastes so much like Sexy Mango that I think Recka might just be some guys in a basement in Malaysia taking DouMei concentrates, diluting them down, and adding sucralose and WS-23 to them. So yeah, rancidly overripe mango, but it's a little less gross to me without the added sweetener that Sexy Mango has. Again, this could be some people's favorite mango, but I think it's disgusting. **TRASH 15**

**Mochi**

It does taste like mochi, not a plain neutral mochi base, which would be a lot cooler. It has lemony citrus and slightly floral tea notes that are nearly as prominent as the mochi itself. Shame, that. **TRASH 16**

**Passionfruit Mango**

Difficult to source, not a great passion fruit, not barely a mango at all. Need to say more? **TRASH 17**

Okish passionfruit, a little more musky earthy side and not nearly as tart and acidic as it should be, smells like passionfruit in the bottle but doesn't vape as tart and acidic as passionfruit should be. At the same time, nowhere near as sweet as you'd expect if it were supposed to be something like a passionfruit syrup. Even bigger problem is it having mango in the name and I'm not really finding the mango in here aside from a little more funk in the finish than a passionfruit should have and a bit of a peachy aftertaste.

**Paw Paw**

Tastes almost identical to VT Paw Paw, but many times more potent. Same underripe cantaloupe kinda floral top note, same creamy banana like feel with some banana taste. Main difference is this is both sweeter and a little more funky and ripe, and a little less floral. It makes it a little more mango-y. If it were easier to obtain than VT Paw Paw I'd buy it instead, both for the slight differences and for the potency, but because it's so similar I'm not sure it's worth the effort to track it down. I'll just stick to VT if I want to vape Paw Paw flavor. **TRASH 18**

**Peanut Butter**

Tastes like a mouthful of burnt peanut butter with a side of vomit. At 0.25%. I have been told to drop it down to 0.15% and then it's good but I'm not even going to bother with that. **TRASH 19**

**Philippine Mango**

Super tasty. Tastes somewhere between an actual mango and peach nectar. Bright, sweet, and citrusy up top, has some funk on it but only enough to be a mango-peach and not a peach, sweet and pulpy and a little nectary to syrupy body with a tiny bit of banana-like creaminess down real low. I wouldn't bother to replace it when it's gone but that doesn't mean I shouldn't enjoy it while it lasts.

Mangummy V1 **TASK 16**

| Co.    | Flavor           | %    |
| ------ | ---------------- | ---- |
| DouMei | Philippine Mango | 0.5  |
| TFA    | Banana Cream     | 1    |

| FLV    | Tequila Agave    | 1    |
| CAP    | Super Sweet      | 0.25 |

0.5% is full flavored for DouMei Philippine Mango.

**Yellow Mango**

Pretty sure this is the best single-flavor mango I have ever tried. Makes me want to stop mixing and just vape this all day because it's literally perfect. Bright and really sweet, yet with a little musky funky ripeness at the same time, without going overboard into overripe. Really comes the closest to a full-on, full flavored, super-natural, perfectly ripe Champagne Mango as I've tasted. Comes across as thick, almost chewy, sweet, and sticky. You can almost see the gnats landing on it - when these extra sweet hyper-flavored mangoes are ripe they really attract gnats. Once again, I can mix different mangoes together and with other flavors and make my own mango goodness just fine without it. I'll be ok when it's gone, but it would be nuts to toss it while there's still some left.

Do Me Mango V1 **TASK 18**

| Co.    | Flavor                  | %    |
| ------ | ----------------------- | ---- |
| DouMei | Yellow Mango            | 0.6  |
| TFA    | French Vanilla Deluxe   | 2.25 |
| WF     | Cotton Candy Jelly Bean | 0.75 |

0.5% is full flavored for this mango as well, but I want to try pushing it just a little.

## Eisaromen

Felix sent it to me.

**Kakoa (Cocoa in Luxemborgish)**

2% tastes like it might do for chocolate milk in a mix. It's like milk chocolate powder. This one tastes fairly similar to milk chocolate, but it's dry and powdery, and too dark, like eating dry Nesquick powder specifically, but not dry Hot Cocoa mix. There's a difference between Nesquick powder and hot cocoa mix that's hard to put into words, but if you smell them side by side you can smell the difference, and this one is closer to Nesquick powder. It seems to me that if you're going to try to force a milk flavor to combine with a darker chocolate flavor to make milk chocolate or chocolate milk, which usually does not work because of the separation of the flavors, this one stands the best chance of actually working, because it already leans more in the milk chocolate direction and just needs a little help.

I'm just going to try it with some FA Milk and see what happens.

Choco Milk Experiment V1 **TASK 19**

| Co. | Flavor        | %    |
| --- | ------------- | ---- |
| ASM | Kakoa         | 2    |
| FA  | Milk          | 2    |
| TFA | Whipped Cream | 1    |
| CAP | Super Sweet   | 0.13 |

I'm fairly skeptical about this really working but hopefully with the TFA Whipped Cream in there doing a little emulsification it just might.

I've got just a little more mucking around with less ubiquitous brands first - Elli's (of Germany I think), Euro Flavor, Faerie's Finest... but I'm getting closer and closer to shit getting real - Flavor West, Flavorah, Flavour Art - all those are coming up quick.

New Flavor Count: 2,753
