# Capella

**Blackberry**

Update. I gave CAP Blackberry one recipe to convince me to keep it, and [French Mornings](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/145323#french_mornings_by_kittybit) was the one I picked. I’m glad I did, it’s delicious. Good enough that I think I would make it again. Only.... I don’t want to, at least not yet. My favorite thing about the recipe is best explained by the recipe note: “The choice of the jam was tricky, as I'm generally pretty tired of strawberry and raspberry this and that. I wanted something dark and deep.” I want that, too! It’s really good. I just want to see if I can make a dark and deep berry croissant I like even more, without CAP Blackberry. If I can't, I’ll always have French Mornings as a backup. So, I’ll hang on to CAP Blackberry for now, but try to mix this without it:

Dark and Deep Frenchie V1 **TASK 1**

Co. | Flavor | %
---|---|----
VT | Croissant | 3
WF | Croissant | 2
CAP | Sugar Cookie | 1
VT | Bilberry Ripe | 1.5
FLV | Jammy Berry | 1
FW | Sweetener | 0.25

I’m not expecting the first version to make me happier than French Mornings, but it should tell me if I’m headed in the right direction or if I should just give up and keep CAP Blackberry.

# Chemnovatic

Oops, I left off a couple of these last week.

**Corn Flakes**

I don’t think I’ve tried this one yet. I’ll mix a sample at 2.5%. **TASK 2**

While I’ve got it out: [There is no spoon](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/240075#there_is_no_spoon_by_n0ctem). **TASK 3**

And [The Mysterious Nightshade Popsicle from Quito](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/273282#the_mysterious_nightshade_popsicle_from_quito_by_azzer) **TASK 4**

**Donut**

A sample at 3% tasted super gross, but I have to note that I’ve been told to try it again much lower. It tasted like I was drinking a puked up slurry of weird butterscotch candy. That vomity BA taste seems to be its most prominent characteristic. There’s some bakery flavor in there so that’s where I can sort of get donut, but just enough to get weird. It’s very sweet but it’s a candy-type sweetness and it’s very buttery, so it really comes across more like it’s supposed to be a butterscotch candy than a donut. And puke.

When it comes to Donut flavors, I really like Wonder Flavours version. It’s not perfect, but it’s going to be hard to beat.

I don’t want to try CNV Donut much lower yet, maybe I will later, but first this recipe: [Kenpachi Zaraki](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/276362#kenpachi_zaraki_by_wolfwheeler). If I like it at all, I’ll revisit CNV Donut, if I don’t, I’m just going to toss it.  **TASK 5**

# Club der Dampfer

My German friend Felix sent me quite a few bottles of flavors from this German flavor company. Danke, Felix.

**Ahornsirup**

Maple syrup.  Mostly tastes like maple syrup mixed with honey, which is a thing you can buy at the store if you want. But unfortunately, with that honey taste, comes the awful honey “cat pee” off note. I might mention that it also has that hay-like grassy note that you get from some tobaccos, but without the rest of the tobacco taste, for whatever reason. So basically it’s a mess, and not very good, I would avoid it. **TRASH 1**

**Apfelkuchen**

Apple Cake? Nope. That’s weird. There’s some cinnamon apple in there, but it’s also weirdly boozy and even more weirdly, chocolatey. Also has a slight butyric sour note.It’s like mixing a shot of apple pie vodka with chocolate milk only the milk has gone off.  I don’t know what the hell kind of apple pie this is supposed to be, but it’s wrong. Just all terribly wrong and badly fucked up. **TRASH 2**

**Aprikose**

At 2.5%, I can tell it’s supposed to be an apricot but it has a strange chemical/perfume off note. It’s like an apricot coated in a fine layer of Johnson & Johnson baby powder, not exactly, but really similar to whatever J&J uses to get that specific baby powder scent. Shame because it’s very flavorful while quite a few other Apricots are fairly soft flavors, but that off-note is distracting. This time I’ll try it at 1.25%, and see if it still gives that nice punch of flavor without the baby powder off note. **TASK 6**

**Cranberry**

This is another one where what’s wrong with it is, that’s just not what cranberry actually tastes like. It tastes more like a tart and sweet red grape. It’s not a bad red grape flavor at all, that’s just not cranberry. The tartness upfront is like a red grape skin and the body specifically tastes like red rather than white or purple grape. It’s just not a cranberry. I’m not hurting badly enough for a red grape flavor to seriously use this. **TRASH 3**

**Dattel**

Date. This flavor has a very nice authentic dry-ish and just musty enough sweet date body and finish. Maybe a little fermented-tasting but overall really solid. However the top notes are a bit gnarly. It has a strange warmth to it, like a warm spice without the spice, and comes across a bit medicinal because of the way it combines with the kinda grape-like fruit up front. Like how sometimes medicine feels warm going down. Not quite the same as boozy but very similar, a warming grape medicine top note.  I bet if you wanted to mix date with spice, CdD Date would do very nicely. Cinnamon, clove, ginger, nutmeg - any of those might fix that by giving the disembodied warmth a recognizable spice to attach itself too. Otherwise seems like it would be a struggle to tame that in a workable way. **TRASH 4**

**Dunkle Pflaume**

Dark Plum. Nearly unvapeable at the recommended 2.5%, but maybe better lower.  At 2.5%, there’s just so much wrong with it. The off notes are diverse and intense. It’s perfumy, medicinal, a little plasticky, and has a weird warm spice like potpourri, AND it has something like a green banana note, not the full banana, but just the part that makes it still green and not great to eat.. I’m sure it’s at least a little better at a lower concentration, some of these off notes are bound to disappear or at least be less intense, but don’t care to bother with it and because it’s probably still not great. Underneath all the nonsense in CDd Dunkle Pflume there’s a dark cherry mixed with peach plum-like flavor with a powdered sugar type of sweetness. More of that would be great, but it’s just such a mess.  **TRASH 5**

**French Toast**

I don’t think I’ve tried this one yet. I’ll mix a sample at 2%. **TASK 7**

**Grapefrucht**

Solid natural grapefruit, little zestier and harsher/citrus throaty than I’d like it to be but full-flavored and without glaring off notes. Only slightly pinkish, not a fully white or ruby red grapefruit. Also a bit top heavy. I’m going to toss it even though it’s not bad, because I don’t see a recipe for it and don’t feel inspired to make one when I could just as easily use FW Ruby Red Grapefruit, FLV Pink Guava, MF Grapefruit, VT, SSA, FA, a couple of INWs. So many grapefruits I don’t have to ask Felix to send more of. **TRASH 6**

 **Honig**

Honey. Horrendous cat piss room note, not nearly as bad to vape as the smell that clings to a room would have you think, but still pretty nasty. Very sweet and syrupy, but enough of that cat pee flavor coming though to make it sickening. Not extremely floral, but the bit of flower flavor that’s there tastes more like chrysanthum than clover or rose, which is kind of interesting. It tastes like it might work as a honey accent at a dilution level, maybe. But this 0.25% at steeping for a week and half is still very strong and very bad. **TRASH 7**

**Kaktusfeige**

I believe this is the most accurate “prickly pear” flavor I’ve tried. A bit of tanginess that tastes like it was stolen from a barely ripe strawberry, but mostly tastes like if watermelon bubblegum grew on trees and you could just pick it. Entirely natural, yet strangely reminiscent of watermelon bubblegum. Also has something a little green and slightly funky keepin it real-istic. And a kind of guava note that tastes more like CAP Sweet Guava than actual guava. No idea how this will perform in a mix, but it’s an excellent prickly pear if you’re looking for one, especially if you’re in the EU and it’s easier and cheaper to get your hands on this stuff.

I was of two minds on this one. Despite being impressed by it, I really don’t want to strain myself trying to make something out of it. I’ve already made myself a prickly pear recipe that I’m happy with using a mix of flavors, and if I’m using a prickly pear flavor, chances are it’s being used a little more for the juiciness (INW New Prickly Pear) than the actual flavor. On the other hand, it tastes quite good. Don’t want to waste it when I could have myself a Prickly Sprite.

Kaktusfeige Soda V1 **TASK 8**

Co.| Flavor| %
---|---|----
CdD | Kaktusfeige| 2
CAP| Lemon Lime | 3
VT | Fizzy Sherbet | 2
INW | Prickly Pear | 1
BCF | WS-23 (30%) | 0.25
CAP | Super Sweet | 0.25

**Kasekuchen**

Very weird that this is called cheesecake, it tastes like old, dried out Hershey’s chocolate. You know how an old chocolate bar starts to turn white, like a dog turd does, and if you’re brave or desperate enough to eat it anyway, it has a crumbly, powdery texture instead of smooth and creamy, and has lost quite a bit of its flavor? This is that. It specifically tastes like Hershey’s in that it has that distinctive Hershey’s milk chocolate sourness to it - and that sourness is as close as it comes to cheesecake. **TRASH 8**

**Kiwi Gold**

Tastes like lemon lime kiwi. Tart, green strawberry-ish kiwi top note, but I also picked up a hint of lime and a bunch of lemon. The lemon is like almost lemon curd, thick and sweet and almost creamy, but also kinda syrupy. Not lemon juice. It’s an odd flavor but definitely not a bad one. When I tried it I was very tempted to just mix it with some VT Fizzy Sherb or FLV Citrus Soda to fizz it up, maybe a dash of one of these other, more authentic kiwis or one of the candyier ones, either way, and just make a simple Kiwi Sprite. Didn’t have time at the time, but I do now.

Kiwi Soda V1 **TASK 9**

Co. | Flavor | %
---|---|----
CdD | Kiwi Gold | 2
FW | Kiwi | 3
FLV | Citrus Soda | 1.25
BCF | WS-23 (30%) | 0.5

It’s basically using Bert’s Soda Base, shout out Staybert, the soda guy, but I think the Kiwi Gold lemon aspect means I don’t need the CAP Lemon Lime that’s in Bert’s Soda Base.

**Lakritz**

Licorice. Tastes like herbal, European-style licorice, complex, not that flat black American Twizzler or Jelly Bean. Sweet, molassesesy, but a little lighter than that really dark black molasses. Problem: They’ve added some menthol-type cooling to it. And I get that licorice is a cool spice, but not like this. And it’s really light, so it seems like people who want some menthol with their licorice will want more of it than this, and people who don’t want any menthol with their licorice will hate it, so what’s it even good for?  It’s good for the **TRASH 9**, IMO.

**Mango**

People who live in Germany are very lucky to have easy access to this one. And I am very lucky that Felix heard what I had to say about it and promptly sent me some more. I love you, Felix.

This is an extremely good mango flavor, better than any made in North America or Australia or other parts of Europe, in my opinion. No shit. It’s important to note that you can almost certainly make something just as good if not better by mixing two or more mango/other fruit flavors together. But if we’re talking single-flavor mango, this is like, top two. It has just this full spectrum of mango flavor from the citrusy high notes to the deep ripe base, and it’s very flavorful. Plenty ripe, without going over into cloying gross overripeness like some do. Just the slightest hint of that piney flavor that really makes it a complete, natural mango flavor, if that’s what you’re in the market for. Also, it packs a big punch of flavor but is still really smooth.

Unless it’s still as easy as “ask Felix for more,” I might not be jumping through whatever hoops it takes to get more of this when I run out. I do have other excellent mango flavors. But I’m sure not tossing it until I run out, so let’s see about using it up.

There are a couple of recipes on ELR I checked out. One of them is just mixing a bunch of Mango flavors together into a supposedly “Perfect Mango,” plus some cooling, but one of those flavors is a mango flavor that I absolutely despise and want nothing to do with, and lots of it, so that’s out. However, just mixing CdD Mango by itself with some cooling and maybe a little sweetener sounds great. I seriously don’t think I’ll get tired of that before a 50ml is gone. It’s that good of a single flavor.

Chilled Mango V1 **TASK 10**

Co. | Flavor| %
---|---|----
CdD | Mango | 2.75
BCF | WS-23 (30%) | 0.25
FW | Sweetener | 0.25

Another ELR recipe is called “Mango de’ Merda” and if the word “Merda” looks vaguely familiar to you, well... CdD apparently has a flavor that’s supposed to taste like LITERAL SHIT. CdD Kuhmist. It means “cow dung.”

What the fuck?!  If I wanted to relive my elementary school field trips to the Fort Worth Stock Show & Rodeo I’d just go to the Fort Worth Stockyards. I’m not vaping cow dung flavor, what the actual fuckity Cleveland steamin fuck?!! You scheiß porno-watching bastards have gone entirely too far this time.

Although, it’s just a three-ingredient recipe and the other ingredient besides mango and FUCKING FECES is TFA Bav Cream and you know, a very simple mango cream made hat way sounds pretty good, minus the BOVINE BUTT JUICE of course.  

No Shit Mango Cream V1 **TASK 11**

Co. | Flavor| %
---|---|----
CdD | Mango | 3
TFA | Bavarian Cream| 3
TFA | Vanilla Swirl | 2

**Maracuja**

Supposed to be passion fruit. This doesn't taste bad, but it doesn’t really taste like passionfruit. Whatever they’re doing to try to make it taste funky and tropical comes across more like a golden raisin to me. More of a slightly fermented note than a ripe tropical one. But they have the bright and tart top notes right. So it’s a tart, juicy, golden raisin, which is just wrong, but also kind of interesting. Could be fun for someone, but not for me. **TRASH 10**

**Milch-Schoki**

That means milk chocolate but by taste it is definitely dark chocolate, very dark, not milk chocolate, and it tastes like dark chocolate liqueur. There’s some creaminess to it but there’s an alcoholic off-note. I like Godiva Dark Chocolate Liqueur and I like this, but people who want to vape milk chocolate or even just chocolate that’s not weirdly boozy are probably going to be turned off by it. Also has a very slight fruity-sweetness that’s a bit off. Also, it’s one of those flavors where the flavor runs out and gets dry and makes me think my wick is starting to get dry when it still has quite a ways to go. It doesn’t seem worth the hassle to me. **TRASH 11**

**Minz-Kaugummi**

Mint gum. Don’t remember having tried it. Will mix a sample at 2% but I got to say, even if it tastes dead-on, my main complaint about mint flavors in general is that too many of them taste too much like mint gum vs fresh mint so I’m probably not going to like it. **TASK 12**

**Pistazie**

Pistachio. Have not tried. Will mix a 2% sample. **TASK 13**

**Rose**

Pretty intensely rose, also very sweet, a little tart, but not lemony. It’s a bit like just putting sugar and powdered citric acid on a fresh, raw rose and shoving the whole thing in your mouth. Has a strong depth of flavor with a lot of mid-range and lower notes, and not so much of that grandma perfume top note. It’s more tart than perfumey. Also a little green and vegetal underneath that, like you got a bit of stem and a petal or two in there as well, but not a darker earthiness like FA Rose has that tastes a little like poop. The greenness might be covered up in a mix, and this might be a good rose flavor for a sweeter application for someone looking for a more intense rose for whatever reason. When it comes to vaping rose flavors, this is number 2 for me behind FLV Rose Essence. And do I really need multiple rose flavors? No, I don’t think I do. **TRASH 12**  

**Salatgurke**

Cucumber is the proper translation but the more direct translation probably means salad gourd or maybe green salad penis, IDK. Regardless, it’s too sweet for a cucumber. LIke way way too sweet, sweeter than any other cuke flavor I’ve tried. Candy sweet with a mouthwatering candy body. It’s weird, but I didn’t find it unpleasant at all. It tastes like green candy. Like maybe how lime candy would taste like if you left out all the citric acid and lime oil. Just weird and green but not tart or clearly tasting like anything except juicy and green. **TRASH 13**

**Saure Limette**

Sour Lime is the translation but not only is it not at all sour, it’s not even a great lime. It’s definitely citrus, but it doesn’t even really taste like lime. It tastes like half the fruit notes from Fruity Pebbles cereal. That was the first thing that came to mind, vaping it. Fruity Pebbles. It’s missing some stuff, some other fruit notes, a cereal body, but the citrusy part of Fruity Pebbles is here, inexplicably called Sour Lime. It’s not gross, but it’s badly named and needs the rest of the Pebbles stuff. **TRASH 14**

**Schlagsahne**

Whipped Cream. Not super terrible, but it has an overly sour taste. Like slightly spoiled whipped cream. Like a whipped cream bikini that’s been on too long before being licked off. More like yogurt than whipped cream, really, it kind of tastes like a very sweetened vanilla yogurt, that sourness is a bit yogurty, except there’s also a mild buttery element to it and I can’t say I’ve had a yogurt this buttery. I dunno about you, but I lick whipped cream bikinis off fast, long before they have a chance to turn yogurty. **TRASH 15**  

**Tabak No. 1**

Described as a sweet, strong tobacco to me. Not entirely a dessert tobacco by itself, but seems like a great tobacco for mixing with dessert. Bold but not dark, realistic hay-like/grassy tobacco, not ashy, a little smokey, with a distinctly caramel taste behind it that’s very sweet but pretty dry. Add some vanilla and you’ve probably got yourself some RY4 that kicks the ass of most single-flavor RY4s. Or you could add something other than vanilla and make some other kind of heavily caramel-flavored tobacco. I wouldn’t hesitate to try a recipe using it, but I didn’t see one I really, really wanted to try, so I’m going to make my own. But I did see one that used some interesting flavor combinations, [Red Oak Cherry](https://e-liquid-recipes.com/recipe/3177935/Red%20oak%20cherry) that got me thinking, and if this works, that’s where some credit is due.

TFA | Cherry Extract | 3

**Tabak No. 178**

This was described to me as “mild burley tobacco.” I don’t know how accurate that is, but it tastes great. It’s got a really prominent roasted nut note that’s not distinctly a specific nut, kind of like a peanut-pecan-almond hybrid, but is very distinctly roasted. At the same time, it’s clearly tobacco, with somewhat dry, mild pipe tobacco underneath that roasted yummy nut. Not terribly sweet, but does have some light brown sugar almost maple sweetness. I wish it had a little stronger tobacco, but that would be easily fixed.

**Tabak No. 245**

This was described as a sweet, strong tobacco to me. It’s a realistic tobacco flavor that’s bright and grassy like hay, but not too bright, not too dry, and very sweet. It’s more cigar-type tobacco than pipe or cigarette tobacco, like one of those sweet flavored cigars but with just the sweetness and not whatever the flavor is. Full-bodied and it doesn’t have any weird off notes. On par with the best tobaccos from INW and FLV. It’s just sweet tobacco, I’m not getting much of anything extra added to it other than increased sweetness, probably more than you want from a tobacco that’s not being used for some kind of dessert tobacco recipe. That extra sweetness isn’t clearly anything but has a creamy, butterscotch-ish quality to it.  

Watch me just lean into those cigar-ish and butterscotch-ish qualities.

**Waffle**

Haven’t tried it, can hardly wait to. I still haven’t found THE Waffle flavor that makes all my waffle dreams come true. Maybe this is the one. I’ll start at 2%. **TASK 19**

**Walderbeere**

Wild Berry. Have not tried. Will mix a 2.25% sample. **TASK 20**

**Waldminze**

Wood mint? Um, ok. I’ll give it a try finally, at 2% I guess. **TASK 21**

That’s it for now. Next up: Decadent Vapours.
