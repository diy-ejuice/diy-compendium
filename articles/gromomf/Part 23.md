Aaaaaaaaand we’re back. Couldn’t find the time and energy to devote to getting rid of flavors for the past two weeks but things are settling back into a routine.

Starting flavor count: 2,634 (down from 2,973)

TASK OR TRASH - Each flavor gets assigned at least one task or it goes in the trash.

## Baker Flavors

**Chocolate Truffle**

Update, again. Chocolate Truffle has been the only Baker Flavor to survive the culling, all because I need it for two profiles.
One is a Girl Scout Thin Mint. Turns out [this recipe](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/6997#skinny_mint_by_jbird) hits that spot (with JF Cookie subbed in for the FA Cookie), although, I think it could use a little update, so next time I’m going to mix this:

Skinny Mint ‘23 v1 **TASK 1**

| Co. | Flavor            | %    |
| --- | ----------------- | ---- |
| FLV | Chocolate Deutsch | 0.8  |
| FA  | Vanilla Cookie    | 2    |
| FLV | Creme de Menthe   | 2.25 |
| FLV | Milk & Honey      | 0.5  |
| FW  | Sweetener         | 0.5  |

Basically the same recipe, I just want a little more Menthe and a little sweetener, and am hoping that I can use FA Vanilla Cookie in place of both the FA Cookie and the FLV Vanilla Custard.

The other profile is a chocolate RY4 like [this one](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/73078#raven_by_id10_t). On that front, I mixed an all-FLV attempt with RY4 2%, Red Burley 0.75%, Kentucky Blend 0.25%, Chocolate Deutsche 0.75%, Butterscotch 0.75%, and Milk Chocolate 0.25% and let it steep for two weeks. I feel like I’m on the right track with these flavors and the more of it I vape, the more it grows on me like it might be done, but my first impression is that it was a bit too sharp, like slight over-flavoring. It’s definitely good enough to finish the bottle already. Since it isn’t clear which flavor or flavors I might have used a little too much of, I’m just going to cut back on all the flavors a little and see what that does for it.

Raven 2, v3 **TASK 2**

All FLV

| Flavor             | %    |
| ------------------ | ---- |
| RY4                | 1.75 |
| Red Burley         | 0.66 |
| Kentucky Blend     | 0.13 |
| Chocolate Deutsche | 0.66 |
| Butterscotch       | 0.66 |
| Milk Chocolate     | 0.13 |

## CAPELLA

**Cinnamon Danish Swirl**

Update. I mixed [Pheasant Ridge](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/64553#pheasant_ridge_by_fear) and as soon as I took a rip I knew I would not be getting rid of CAP CDS anytime soon, even if I find or create a great snickerdoodle recipe and apple butter cookie recipe that don’t require it. Now I feel like I should try to find more solid gold uses for it. It’s a similar sentiment to “if you can’t beat ‘em, join ‘em.”

[Derailed 1-2-3](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/176318#derailed_1_2_3_suicide_bunny_clone_by_slushy) **TASK 3**

[Cinner](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/207568#cinner_by_kontravention) with JF Cookie instead of FA. **TASK 4**

[Cinilla RY4](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/211695#cinnilla_ry4_by_thefloridaman) **TASK 5**

[HAZMAT Custard](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/143321#hazmat_custard_by_slushy) **TASK 6**

[Almost a Sugar Bear](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/292330#almost_a_sugar_bear_by_fadedjay1) **TASK 7**

## Flavor West

**Pink Lemonade**

Oops, I meant to include this one last time. Sweet candy lemon windex at 4%. Seems like it might be usable down low as an accent to add some lemony acidity to other fruits but not as a main lemon flavor, strong cleaning product off note.

On the other hand, some really subpar flavors have been used to create some amazing stuff, so I want to give [Cotton Joose](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/235261#cotton_joose_by_coil_pop) a try before I go chucking FW Pink Lemonade. I do love that WF Cotton Candy Jelly Bean. **TASK 8**

**Pralines & Cream**

Oops again, I was so discombobulated by grief and holidays I inadvertently left this one off the last edition as well.

FW Pralines & Cream is good shit. Sweet and nutty, pecan forward but with lots of brown sugar. Seems to be missing the “cream” part but that’s fine with me. It’s named after the ice cream flavor but instead it’s just the nutty sweets inside the ice cream, similar to butter pecan, but with more intense caramelized sugary sweetness and no butter taste. Nice roasted pecan here, a little dry yet smooth at the same time, like some marshmallow flavors. Ready to go for some vanilla ice cream flavor for actual pralines and cream, or chocolate to make it a turtle-type flavor, or possible an addition for a pecan pie with pie crust flavors and blending in some butter and custardy flavors.

I used it to make this [tobacco turtle](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/90552#mitch_mcconnell_by_id10_t) recipe five years ago and I’m sure it could use an update both because Holy Vanilla is no more and because I’m older and wiser, but I’ll mix the original first (if I have any Holy V left) and think about how to do that. **TASK 9**

That was based on this simple [Salted Caramel Praline](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/86940#salted_caramel_pralines_by_coop34) that also uses Holy Vanilla but I already have an idea of how I want to try revising that one.

Salted Caramel Praline ‘23 V1 **TASK 10**

| Co. | Flavor                 | %   |
| --- | ---------------------- | --- |
| WF  | Salted Caramel         | 3   |
| FW  | Pralines & Cream       | 4   |
| WF  | Tahitian Vanilla Cream | 3   |

[Melted: The Cream of Pralines](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/190890#melted_the_cream_of_pralines_by_bjorama) looks fantastic and has glowing reviews, sign me up! **TASK 11**

Want to try this [Praline Ice Cream](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/218726#praline_ice_cream_by_sensory_overload) as well. **TASK 12**

And of course [Prapple Bacco 2021](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/235253#prapple_bacco_2021_by_nowar) goes on the list. **TASK 13**

Finally, [Sweet Nuts](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/194221#sweet_nuts_by_microbe), because while the mixer admits to missing the mark of their original intent, it was at least inspired by something I adore, “wonderful, sweet, cinnamony toasted pecans you sometimes find at fairs or carnivals.” Or Buc-ee’s. I can’t go on a Texas road trip without stopping at Buc-ee’s coming and going and can’t leave Buc-ee’s without them. **TASK 14**

**Rainbow Sherbet**

Very sweet, orangey sherbet stuff, with a very slight baby powder off note at 4%. It’s mostly orange - that’s the one fruit that really sticks out - but other fruit stuff is going on as well, which I can’t really separate from the orange. It’s not really, really creamy, but the orange note tastes similar to orange sherbet and there’s some creaminess there. Besides having a baby powder off note similar WF Champagne Soda, it has kind of a powdery feel to it that makes it seem like they might be trying to do the fizzy powdery candy type of sherbet, but from an American company, I doubt that.

FW Rainbow Sherbet is very sweet. And it ought to be sweet, it’s got actual sugar in it, so it’s bad for your coils and cotton and probably not good for you.

I’d avoid it, but it definitely doesn’t taste as bad as some other Rainbow Sherbet flavors. If you really wanted to use it, that baby powder taste might not come through in a mix. Add some more orange and some rich but not too rich cream and could probably make a pretty good Orange Sherbet, but I’m not going to stick around to find out. **TRASH 1**

**Raspberry**

Mostly a very artificial tasting red raspberry candy candy flavor, which would be fine if that’s all it was, but it has a bit of a weird, bitter, medicine-like chemical top note. It also vapes a little dry, and tastes a little like cotton candy, like there’s too much ethyl maltol in it. It’s also a little harsh.

4% FW Raspberry seriously tastes like raspberry cotton candy drizzled with medicine, but it’s better at 3%. Less bitter, less dry, less harsh, even though it still tastes a little mediciney. So it might not be as bad a little lower in some kind of red candy mix. Seeing nothing I want to make out of it, **TRASH 2**

**Razzleberry**

I love this flavor. It is 100% candy, no one would mistake it for real fruit. But it is super good candy. It tastes like a darker candy raspberry, or more precisely, a mix of candy raspberry and candy blackberry, which is what I think it’s supposed to be, like those bumpy little black and red candies that are sugary on the outside and gummy on the inside. Fair amount of tart, almost sour top note. Not thin at all, a nice, deep flavor and a thick body that’s a little chalky and a little chewy at the same time, like Chewy Sweet-Tarts.

FW Razzleberry is sweet, but because it tastes so much like candy, it seems like it could stand to be even sweeter and a little Super Sweet would go really well with it. It also tastes like a small amount of it could do amazing things to a candy strawberry or even candy cherry mix, though I wouldn’t bring it anywhere near something that’s supposed to be a natural berry. Overall, just a really excellent candy-type flavor.

Been itching off and on to do something with this one and now that I’m finally getting around to it, I want to start with these:

[Crobat](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/251500#crobat_purple_and_blue_fruits_by_danielthevapeman) **TASK 15**

[Mage Blue Razz](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/277728#mage_blue_raz_by_sensory_overload) **TASK 16**

[Frosty Blue](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/224218#frosty_blue_by_kontravention) **TASK 17**

**Red Bowl**

It tastes like Red Bull, without any glaring issues aside from having to crank it up to 8% to get a good, not-strong-but-maybe-strong enough flavor out of it. Which basically means it tastes like a whole pack of sweet tarts melted in battery acid, sweet and tart with some acid but not a clear citrus flavor, a bitter licking-a-battery edge to it, something not quite cherry and not quite grape either, and some faint Juicy Fruit gum in the background. Mostly syrupy with something powdery at the end. A little of the soft side even at 8%, not like an ethyl maltol muting but more like too many flavors crammed into one bottle. Finish even emulates that weird chemical aftertaste of Red Bull. I think this might be the most authentic Red Bull-type flavor, though I found it personally less enjoyable to vape than some of the ones that were a little off the mark but still basically taste like Red Bull.

I’m not really wanting to vape Red Bull. I don’t even drink it unless it’s mixed with vodka and I’m planning on making some bad decisions and hoping to not remember them very clearly. **TRASH 3**

**Red Licorice**

Bold Red Vines-ish flavored top notes. Mostly cherry, with something like raspberry behind it. Has a kind of cool spice to it that I didn’t understand until I saw that TFA Red Licorice shares an aroma called Methyl Salicylate METH-il sa-LIS-i-late
That comes from the wintergreen plant, with only a few flavors such as Bubblegum and Wintergreen - as well as all of their root beer flavors. I’m guessing that aroma is in actual Red Vines because the flavor is pretty spot on, especially TFA’s, but also FW. Some sweet, waxy candy body but kind of top heavy and even a little thin, with a bit of accompanying throat hit. Has an odd off note like the taste of koolada minus the cold sensation, kind of chemically, faint enough that it’s not nasty, but still. TFA Red Licorice is a little better. **TRASH 4**

**Red White & Blue**

From the name alone you’d probably expect something like a bomb pop, but Flavor Jungle tries to sell it with “Show off your patriotic streak with Red White and Blue, the famous combination of raspberry, blueberry and yogurt flavors. We recommend mixing this flavor with fruit or custard flavors in your DIY recipe.” Meanwhile, FlavorWest describes it as a blend of Starfruit, Blackberry, and Strawberry “perfectly mixed to create a sweet, delicious and aromatic flavoring.” So what the hell is it?

It really doesn’t matter because it contains 20 to 30% sugar syrup and no one should be vaping that, but I get neither of those things. It tastes like blueberry lemonade. So no raspberry, strawberry, yogurt, or starfruit. Just blueberry lemonade. But the blueberry is a little candied and the lemonade is very weak, and there’s a faint chemical/plasticy type of off note. All this does is make me want a GOOD blueberry lemonade vape. **TRASH 5**

**Rice Treat**

Take a rice crispy treat wrapped in plastic. Cut a slit in the plastic wrapper to vent and toast in a toaster oven until plastic is burned off and rice krispies are slightly brown. Now you have FW Rice Treat. It’s very sweet and kind of gooey in the marshmallow department which is nice, but there’s a little plastic off note on top and it tastes overly toasted in the middle. **TRASH 6**

**Rockstar Type**

Doesn’t taste exactly like RockStar but it does taste like some kind of odd, bubble-gummy citrus soda. It’s missing most of that bitter battery acid “energy drink” edge and it’s not very fruity, but does have a little citrus bite to it. It’s very sweet but not too dry, actually a little wet or mouthwatering. A bit soft all the way around even at 8% but not weak, just about in line with what you’d expect from a lightly flavored soda. That citrus bit keeps it peppy on top and the liquified bubble gummy flavor builds to the finish. One of those silly bubblegum or cotton candy-flavored sodas is the most obvious use that comes to mind, but it seems like you could also bury that bubblegum under a vanilla and come out with a pretty solid vanilla cream soda.
I’d be fine without it but there’s [a recipe mixing it with FLV Mango](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/34869#insomnia_by_dazcole) and I am intrigued. I’m not going to mix that recipe, mostly because I can’t take the throat razors of FA Passionfruit, but

Mango Rock v1 **TASK 18**

| Co. | Flavor        | %    |
| --- | ------------- | ---- |
| FW  | Rockstar Type | 8    |
| FLV | Citrus Soda   | 1.25 |
| FA  | Indian Mango  | 2    |
| CAP | Super Sweet   | 0.5  |
| BCF | WS-23 (30%)   | 0.5  |

Looks like something I might be able to fuck with.

**Root Beer**

Root Beer Barrels, all day. Full-flavored, full bodied, saturated syrupy sweet body. Hard to describe why they are more like the candy than actual root beer other than it’s flat, but it’s also a bit heavier on the spicy and herbal side, with a lot less wintergreen and vanilla. Some people taste too much wintergreen in FLV Root Beer but I think it’s just and comparing FW’s version to that makes me pull the **TRASH 7** lever on this one.

**Root Beer Float**

Not a float. Tastes like root beer barrel candy if there were some imaginary cream-filled version of them. Nice thick sweet texture, smooth vanilla finish.

Again, it’s not bad, but I can put two flavors together and have something much better. **TRASH 8**

**Rose Tobacco**

Holy god that’s awful. It’s rose and lemon pledge candy. No sign of tobacco anywhere, not even a little hint of dirty earthy whatever. Just very sweet pledgy lemon hard candy body that tastes like it was spritzed with grandma’s perfume. I found that some of the rose flavors have a citrus and even clearly lemon quality for whatever reason, but this one is straight up lemon-scent furniture polish, and not pleasant at all. Probably the only thing I could think do with this is if you wanted to make fruit loops with rose water instead of milk and you found ways to tamp down both the perfumey floral and cleaning productness of the lemon while also adding a cereal texture and then, I mean, yes, that seems do-able, but why? Why would anyone do that? It would be an abomination. **TRASH 9**

**Ruby Red Grapefruit**

AWESOME. Appropriately bitter grapefruit zest over a sweet and very red grapefruit body. Lots of zest, and it’s throughout and lingering. The body part is a little waxy like candy, but against that zest it’s mouthwatering overall, and there’s a blood orange sort of earthiness that makes it both taste more natural and more like a ruby red grapefruit than a white grapefruit. It’s a punchier, bolder flavor with much more citrus tartness than most other grapefruit flavors. A bit harsh for flavors overall, but on par for citrus. Does vape a little warm, like citruses unfortunately can do.

I need it for the beloved [Terrorhawk](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/13499#terrorhawk_by_concreteriver) **TASK 18**

I also need it for [Grunch](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/162546#grunch_by_kopel) - gross-sounding name, fantastic vape. **TASK 19**

[Summer Somewhere Else](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/176101#summer_somewhere_else_by_nachef) is somewhere else on my to-do list already, now it can be joined by [Flamingos & Sunsets](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/296204#flamingos_sunsets_by_ninedimensions). **TASK 20**

[Fruit From The Stars](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/194510#fruit_from_the_stars_pleiades_by_ninedimensions) looks like a beautiful mess I might wanna get into. **TASK 21**

And I gotta try this weird [Little Cup cake](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/235693#little_cup_cake_by_mixinvixens). **TASK 22**

And why not a [Watermelon Grapefruit Citrus Soda](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/154753#gwar_citrexecutioner_watermelon_grapefruit_citrus_soda_by_queeryourvape). **TASK 23**

**Rum**

It tastes like using degreaser to clean up a greasy mess, with some cherry and brown sugar notes. **TRASH 10**

**Rum Tobacco**

Unfortunately this does not taste like rum or tobacco. It tastes like brown sugar and throat hit on top of a small small amount of light tobacco mixed with rotting vegetable leavings, like potato eyes and carrot tops. I don’t know how FW even manages to do tobacco so badly. **TRASH 11**

**Salt Water Taffy**

I don’t think I’ve tried this one. I’ll mix a 4% sample. **TASK 24**

While I’ve got it out, might as well give this [Mango Chew Chew](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/92944#mango_chew_chew_by_fluffymarshmallow) a mix. **TASK 25**

This one commands, [Don’t Eschew The Chew](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/192647#don_t_eschew_the_chew_by_bananaslamma) so I guess I’d better not eschew it. **TASK 26**

And finally, my friend’s recipe that looks really weird to me, [Cool Caramel Chew](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/198528#cool_caramel_chew_by_kittybit). Peppermint and caramel, really? **TASK 27**

**Salted Caramel**

Right, so, no salt. None. Zero. Hard to stay mad at it over that for long, though. I’m pretty sure that until WF came out with their salted caramel, this was the best caramel flavor out there. There is some great caramel flavor here. Rich-tasting and a little creamy and buttery but not super-thick or even as thick as I want it to be. Smooth. Could be the only or main caramel in a caramel-forward recipe but could also benefit from some thicker cream. No off notes, other than a slight, vague, intermittent nuttiness where there should be more sweetness, I guess that’s supposed to be the “salt.” Not really as sweet by itself as you want a caramel to be but that’s an easy fix with sweeter flavors or sweeteners; or could be a bonus in situations like tobaccos (which it blends very well with) and alcohol flavors like bourbon and rum (which it also blends well with). Wild range on this one, a small amount will make a big difference in a mix, but you can also push it really high if you want caramel upfront.

Even though WF’s version is quite a bit better, I need FW Salted Caramel for several recipes already on my to-mix list, including the Cool Caramel Chew recipe that I just added to it literally a minute ago.

I made a recipe with this [Grape Escape](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/78817#grape_escape_by_id10_t) and at the time I was proud of myself for my success at mixing a grape Swisher sweet vape, but now that I think about it, just how badly do I want to vape a grape Swisher? Not that badly, it turns out. It’s not a good enough reason to keep FW Salted Caramel. Same goes for ConcreteRiver’s [25 Bucks](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/22505#25_bucks_by_concreteriver). Great, you made a raspberry Swisher-style vape. But did anyone ask for one? I DO think my [Two Kentuckies](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/90550#two_kentuckies_by_id10_t) recipe is a reason to keep Salted Caramel, if I remember correctly. It’s been awhile. Better mix a fresh batch to refresh my recollection. **TASK 28**

There is definitely not enough tobacco in this [EZ RY4](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/226427#ez_ry4_by_rug_ly), but I want to try it anyway, mostly because it looks like it might be very nice as a base with just a little added baccy (I’m thinking 1% FLV Native, MaxSavage style). **TASK 29**

This [Salted Caramel Tiramisu](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/271765#tiramisu_au_caramel_sale_by_kuri_santou) uses both FW and WF Salted Caramel for some reason and I’m going to mix it up and see if I can tell what that reason is. Also, where can I get a real salted caramel tiramisu to eat, please? **TASK 30**

Same mixer, this time with a [Cinnamon Dusted Caramel Apple Dainty](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/266639#cinnamon_dusted_caramel_apple_dainty_by_kuri_santou). I’ll be subbing JF for the FA cookie, but either way, that cookie layer looks fantastic, and why not put cinnamon apple and salted caramel on it? **TASK 31**

Not many flavors tossed this week but it still feels good to get back to work on it.

New Flavor Count: 2,623
