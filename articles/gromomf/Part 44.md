## CAPELLA

**Graham Cracker**

Update. I was keeping this one anyway for one of my own recipes, but found some more to try in search of other reasons for keeping/restocking it.

[Warlike Mailboxes](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/145963) came out terrific after steeping for a couple of weeks. After steeping for a couple weeks the tobacco is very robust and forward, but I love the pleasant highlights of spice and smoke and the undercurrent of creamy butterscotch, graham, and vanilla. It goes on the list of favorites because I could see occasionally wanting this for variety, but should be noted that if I had to pick just one butterscotch and tobacco recipe, the winner would easily be [BUDDERSTOTCH](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/35021#budderstotch_aka_burleyscotch_v2_by_fear). Both recipes have the same wonderful blend of tobaccos, but the butterscotch comes out swinging in the Budderstotch (which is truly a dessert tobacco with a balance of butterscotch, tobacco, and vanilla), while it serves as more like just a strong accent in Warlike Mailboxes.

Another one was ok, but the combination of marshmallow flavors in it turned out to be a little too much and gave it a little of that fake marshmallow taste that I don't care for. The another one tasted as advertised, cupcake with marshmallow goop and Teddy Grahams on top. I gave it five stars and will gladly vape the bottle, but I’m leaving it off the extra most bestest favorites list because the cake comes across just a little too dry for me.

CAP Graham Cracker is also in about five different things I’ve already planned to make, and a couldn’t find anything else. But it’s also in one of my new favorite recipes, [French Mornings](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/145323#french_mornings_by_kittybit), so I’ll make some more of that **TASK 1**

## FLAVOUR ART

**Mad Mix (Mad Fruit)**

So apparently this is supposed to taste like an energy drink? It kinda does taste Red Bull-ish, and I can certainly imagine a small amount of it being used to give a bit more tart punch to another, softer energy drink favor. But by itself this is hard to vape at 3%, despite being a fairly light flavor. Harsh right on top, makes my throat want to close up to reject it. Feels like vaping a harsh lemon, without a lot of citrus flavor, but with that tart, acidic bite. Flavor itself is more of an essence of Juicy Fruit gum, a little on the thin side, with some chalky, dry but slightly sweet body. A hint of something like a candy cherry, without that cherry candy plastic nightmare off note, deep down in there. Lingering sweet-tart note reminiscent of a cherry pixie stick but more chalky than powdery.

I don’t really want to mix any of recipes I saw that use it, so **TRASH 1**

**Madagascar (Vanilla Classic)**

It’s like the disembodied spirit of homemade vanilla ice cream. Dark, like McCormick’s vanilla extract, and slightly sweet. Not a spicy vanilla, but not a bright candy vanilla either. Just dark. Very thin without being dry. Lingering vanilla extract flavor.

I need it to make [Custard NOW](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/73934#custard_now_by_ediblemalfunction) **TASK 2** and I want to try [Custard NOW, Loaded](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/210414#custard_now_loaded_by_ediblemalfunction) **TASK 3**

Also, a couple more decadent-looking custards, [curleh mustache](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/236633#curleh_mustache_by_chumbles) **TASK 4** and [Dead Man’s Custard](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/282706#dead_man_s_custard_66_by_fucksex), **TASK 5** the former having some interesting and delicious-looking accouterments, the latter looking like a simpler classic custard with more modern flavor concentrations.

An odd recipe that looks right up my alley, [Booze at the Malt Shop](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/155764#booze_at_the_malt_shop_by_unappreciatedrobot), a bourbon-spiked chocolate malt. **TASK 8**

And because I love a good citrus bakery and really want to see how this one works out with CAP Lemon Lime and VT Fizzy Sherbet instead of the usual FE Lemon and whatever lemon tart or lemon meringue flavor, [7up Poundcake](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/222817#7up_poundcake_by_renickuluss). **TASK 7**

**Mandarin**

Sort of straddles the line between a mandarin and a tangerine. Somewhat waxy, but sweet and slightly juicy, with some sweeter tangerine type zest notes and more of a mandarin base. Mild throat hit that builds over time for me. Makes for a great accent to other oranges or to add a hint of mandarin/tangerine to a recipe.

I’m not attached to it, it’s very far from my favorite orange-y type flavor, but I need it for a couple of recipes that I’ve already decided to try, so I’ll hang on to it for a little while longer. And even longer than that, because I found a few more:

I see two folks tried to clone “NOMS X2 Cactus Jackfruit Mandarin,” whatever that is, so I’m going to try them both find out whether I love either of them.

[Desert Nectar](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/249271#desert_nectar_by_baer) has a scary high amount of INW Cactus, but it’s mixed with a really interesting combination of things, CAP Sweet Lychee, CAP Sweet Tangerine, a ton of TFA Jackfruit. I’m looking forward to trying it out, without having high expectations (although if the 5-start reviews keep piling on, those are going to start rising). **TASK 8**

[Cactus Jack](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/172045#cactus_jack_by_easternfog). A much simpler version, with a slightly less scary amount of cactus. **TASK 9**

And Sam’s [Proper](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/273636#proper_by_eyemsam) milk and honey recipe. I’ll just use FW Sweetener for the PUR I don’t have, because 0.75% CAP Super Sweet would be a lot of sucralose for me. **TASK 10**

**Costa Rica Mango**

Their original mango, not to be confused with the newer FA Indian Mango.

It kind of tastes like a green banana wrapped in a mango peel. Top notes dry, green, a little sour, underripe, rindy, body a slight a bit of odd underlying creamy mouthfeel with some musky funk to it so it’s not thin but the body is not even remotely like a natural juicy ripe mango.

Far from the worst mango in my opinion, but remember what we do with mediocre mangoes? **TRASH 2** them.

**Mango Green**

Intensely piney to the point that it leaves a sharp pine taste in my mouth like I’ve just been chewing on a pine needle, but also has some of that funk of a very ripe mango, so more like a rotting pine needle. I don’t really know what people want from a green Mango flavor, I only want ripe mango, but I imagine it’s something more like VT Green Mango, which does have that piney peel note but has a base more like sweetened lime juice and doesn’t have this really powerful, lingering for a really long time, pine needle taste plus tropical funk.

If I saw a recipe that used it and otherwise looked good, I might give it a shot, but it seems like VT Green Mango would be a better choice if you were into this sort of thing, and there are currently no public recipes at all on ATF that use it. **TRASH 3**

**Mangosteen**

I have no idea how accurate this flavor is because I've never tried a real mangosteen. 1%- mild, tastes like some kind of exotic berry. 3% - Unique, tastes like very sweet peach combined with sour grape and just a hair of the vanilla musk perfume worn by my first love decades ago. Sweet and juicy, also like that girl, not dry. I like it. 4% - Perfume now too strong, unpleasant floral note, abort mission.

I’m looking forward to trying these recipes that use this really interesting flavor:

[Jackie Ohh](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/60702#jackie_ohh_by_jellobiafra). Mixing it with Jackfruit and Vanilla Swirl seems like a good idea. **TASK 11**

[Eastern Jewel](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/267810#eastern_jewel_by_davidn2kl). So does mixing it with whipped cream and marshmallow. **TASK 12**

[Violet Hops](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/62859#violet_hops_floral_herbal_exotic_by_echodub). This one is a little more out there in the realm of the weird, but it looks like the TFA French Vanilla and WF Frozen Yogurt will be a very nice counterweight to the Yakima Hops, FA Violet, and Mangosteen. **TASK 13**

**Maple Syrup**

This is a pretty good, clean maple flavor without all the off-notes that some other maple flavors have, but it’s far from perfect. First, it's kinda flat like imitation maple versus the real deal. But more significantly, it’s called Maple Syrup but it’s more like just maple without the syrup, it lacks sweetness and doesn’t have that syrupy body. This could make it like the perfect maple note for a tobacco or if you’re doing something like a dry maple cookie. But not if you want something syrupy. It’s thin and top heavy and dry. But not weak. It has this annoying habit of growing after a steep and can really take over your top notes, so you have to test everything after a couple of weeks and make sure it isn’t overrun with maple, and if it is, go back and use a little less until it’s right. I could be wrong and it could be too bright for real maple syrup, it might need something else to darken it, but it seems like VT Golden Syrup might be good for really making this like maple syrup.

I need this for one of my favorite recipes, [Banana Bread French Toast](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/149328#banana_bread_french_toast_developed_by_developed). **TASK 14**

It’s also in at least half a dozen things I’ve already planned to try, and now two more:

[Wanksta](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/272366#wanksta_by_davidn2kl), a sweet peanut butter tobacco recipe. **TASK 15**

And [Stacked](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/271142#s_t_a_c_k_e_d_by_sensory_overload), which is said to be “a delicious stack of buttery waffles topped with maple-syrup glazed bananas.” **TASK 16**

**Marshmallow**

This is a lot of people’s favorite marshmallow. I think it’s oddly a little dark and malty, never had a marshmallow that tasted quite like that, but otherwise it does taste pretty much like a marshmallow. It’s sweet and neither especially thick nor super thin. A little dry, which a marshmallow should be, kind of powdery. More like a cereal marshmallow than a big fluffy marshmallow and definitely not a marshmallow cream. Little bit of darker vanilla in there. It’s another one I wouldn’t use for candy (except chocolate candy or candy with nuts) because that maltiness seems like it would be out of place, but it works very well in things like cereals and bakeries, custards, some ice creams. It doesn’t act as an invisible blender/softener as well as TFA Marshmallow because it separates a little, you usually get a touch of a marshmallowy finish with FA.

Need it for and old favorite, [Black Custard](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/158168#black_custard_by_staybert), and a new one [TOC’s White Fluffy Clouds](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/197071#toc_s_white_fluffy_clouds_by_tocmichellehughes). I also need it (for now) for one of my own recipes, but a remix will probably use a better marshmallow. Already have plans to mix about 7 recipes that use it. Just one more: [Magilla’s Custard](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/206844#magilla_s_custard_by_seakow) looks like a very nice buttery custard with just a hint of banana. **TASK 17**

**Marzipan**

My tastes have changed. When I tried FA Marzipan for the first time years ago (likely while by senses were still recovering from smoking), I thought it tasted just like Jordan Almonds and tasted nothing like cherry. But I’ll be damned if the sample I mixed up more recnelty doesn’t taste like flat cherry soda with a splash of almond extract in it. Weird. I think the soda + extract analogy works because it’s a bit on the thin side; like liquid consistency, nothing to give the illusion of a “thick” mouthfeel. Yet, at the same time, it’s full-bodied, with lots of flavor start to finish. It starts out very flat cherry soda on top and then sweetness and almond flavor builds. It’s very sugary sweet like soda or candy. I still like it, but I’m a little sad that it tastes like cherry to me now.

I need it for [Manson and The Pebbles](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/227657#manson_and_the_pebbles_developed_by_developed) and possibly a slightly improved version of that in the future.

Also want to try [GIGI](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/116376#gigi_by_cob), which looks like an updated Grack Juice with better cooling and cherry and floral notes joining the icy grape-cactus weirdness. **TASK 18**

And this [Cherry Cheesecake](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/292331#cherry_cheesecake_by_fadedjay1), using Marzipan and JF Strawberry Sweet to fix INW Cherries. **TASK 19**

**Mellow Sunset**

FA says, “Mellow Tobacco provides a mild and gentle tobacco flavor with a slight earthy taste.“

That tastes awful. Before reading FA’s the description I could not tell what it was supposed to be. But it tastes like vague kinda lemony citrus and something that is either supposed to be tobacco or tea... like tobacco with tea bitterness.. Or tea with tobacco grassiness and a bit of ashiness.. I don’t know. Doesn’t really taste exactly like either. Also has some caramelly sweetness with a hint of licorice in the finish, which just tastes wrong up against everything else. It’s like tobacco/tea Nonna’s Cake. Lemon and licorice. Fucking Flavourart. **TRASH 4**

**Meringue**

It’s sweet and sugary and has an airy, fluffy feel, with a subtle creaminess down low, with and a fairly prominent lightly toasted top note. Almost like a toasted marshmallow, which isn’t far off from meringue, with a slight eggy difference that makes it a very authentic meringue, somewhere between the top of a lemon meringue pie and a drier, crispy meringue cookie.

This is an ingredient in an astounding 1,127 public recipes on ATF. Obviously I’m not getting rid of FA Meringue, or even listing all the reasons for keeping it and things I’ve planned to try that use it. I will find a couple of new things to mix, though.

[Soho Time](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/96967#soho_time_snv_new_skool_tribeca_type_by_juicefairy) Most recipes by the lovely and talented Juicefairy look like they have too many ingredients, so I’m really interested in trying this old one that has only two, FA Meringue and FA Soho. There must be something special about that combo for her to not have felt the need to add anything else. **TASK 20**

[Simple Vanilla Custard Meringue Tobacco](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/291157#simple_vanilla_custard_meringue_tobacco_by_jimbo8), another simple recipe with a relatively (compared to the average amount of it used in recipes) high amount of FA Meringue. The other ingredients are just WF Vanilla Ruyan Custard (love!) and INW Shisha Vanilla. **TASK 21**

**Metaphor**

Odd lemon cake donut. The lemon tastes a little pledgy. Not full-on cleaning product, but like a cereal lemon rather a natural baked-in lemon or a fresh lemon juice drizzle or a lemon frosting. Like a cake with the same artificial lemon flavor in it that’s used to make fruit loops. The cake tastes like a dense, fried cake donut, with a crispy edge and a little oil. It just begs the question, does this come without lemon, Flavour Art, please?

I see some smart-looking recipes out there using it as part of a fruit cereal (Froot Loops/Pebbles) situation or harnessing that lemon to boost berries, but I have other reasons for not wanting to try those and no other reason to keep FA Metaphor. **TRASH 5**

**Milk**

I believe this is as perfect a milk flavor as you’re going to get. Clean, mellow, dairy taste, thick-tasting without crossing over from milk into half-and-half, even has a palate coating kinda feel to it like actual whole milk. Full mouthfeel satisfaction, very much emulates drinking whole milk, almost perfectly exemplifies the difference between cream, whole milk, and skim milk where it’s just right like goldilocks, not too thick, not too thin, just right. If you twisted my arm and forced me to say something negative about it, it could stand to be just a hair more malty/nutty/savory but it does not have any off notes or balance issues or other problems that I can identify.

I need it for my [Pank Milk](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/184392#pank_milk_by_id10_t) and [Saturday Morning Macaron](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/95350#saturday_morning_macaron_by_id10_t) recipes.

I need it for my [Hello Daddy Hello Mom](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/84337#hello_daddy_hello_mom_by_id10_t) recipe, but I threw that one together in a weekend after trying TFA Cherry Extract and it’s about time I mix some more and think about updating this 5-year-old recipe. **TASK 22**

I also need it for Manson & The Pebbles, and five recipes I’ve planned to try (3 of them by Wolfwheeler, I guess he really likes FA Milk, too).

Also, [Cow Tales Caramel](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/281555#cow_tales_caramel_by_kuri_santou), that looks amazing, possibly better than eating the actual candy. **TASK 23**

And [Wookie Cookie II](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/308017#wookiee_cookie_ii_by_cam9535) - a dairy forward milk & cookies recipe that looks terrific to me. **TASK 24**

**Morning Sun**

It’s mostly a non-vanilla cream with a noticeable but light dairy twang reminiscent of FA Cream Fresh, with a vague fruit note that tastes somewhat like kiwi, but not just kiwi, and there’s something else fruity in there behind it.FlavourArt calls this "A milky flavour carefully blended with the sweetness of freshly cut fruit ... the perfect continental all day breakfast!" Not very rich, but a thick, smooth texture. There’s a very light something baked hiding in there that people have called a pastry or cereal but I swear it’s just some FA Meringue. The whole thing reminds me of a very watered-down Coop’s Kiwi Cheesecake, which is just FA Kiwi, TFA Cheesecake Graham Crust, and FA Meringue.

There’s absolutely nothing offensive here, but I’m not sure what it’s really good for, except maybe a one-shot for lazy mixing a light vape that you could indeed vape all day without wearing yourself out. It just seems like a wildly inessential flavor. Just add a bunch of FA Cream Fresh and a little FA Meringue to your favorite fruit or combination of fruits and make your own Morning Sun. **TRASH 6**

**MTS Wizard**

Never vaped this standalone, but have tried some recipes that use it. I think it’s probably just triacetin, which is a component that gives an interesting full kinda oily mouthfeel and works as a flavor emulsifier. It’s in TFA Smooth and TFA Whipped Cream as the main reason you’d use either of those flavors.

It’s used in one recipe I’ve planned to try, called Duchess Reserve Final. It’s also used in Kopel’s [Fireside](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/52486#fireside_by_kopel). I can’t remember whether I liked that one enough to consider it a favorite recipe, so I’ll mix it again and see. **TASK 25**

**Mulberry**

Dark berry potpourri/perfume. Pretty much tastes like the berries from the mulberry tree in my backyard, but covered in this potpourri/perfume thing that tastes like a milder version of the perfume that makes FA Blackberry so terrible. I would avoid this one, it doesn’t taste useable. **TRASH 7**

**Mustard Water Soluble**

Smells like Chinese hot mustard. Vapes like some kind of weird mix between that and Dijon mustard. It’s a little harsh and I’m not sure why you’d want such a thing but hey, nothing seriously off target here. **TRASH 8**

New Flavor Count: 2,448
