# CAPELLA Fuji Apple  

Update. I’d forgotten just how juicy CAP Fuji Apple is, but [Midnight Marauder](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/83580) reminded me. It also gave me a new recipe to add to the list of favorites, and another reason to keep CAP 27 Fish (and all of the other ingredients to make it). Click the link. Read the description. If that sounds good to you, give it a mix. I don’t think you’ll regret it. It MIGHT even change your mind about vaping licorice flavors. **TASK 1** to mix some more!

Because CAP Fuji Apple it is so juicy and has that nice apple body, I really want to mix it with watermelon, [Water-malone](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/53215#water_malone_live_mixing_summertime_recipes_by_enyawreklaw) style. My beef with Water-Malone is that although it is tasty, that CAP Double Apple sticks out too much, it’s too sharp. I saw this Water-Malone-ish recipe, [Country Melon](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/265561#country_melon_by_riotcoon), but it’s missing the watermelon aside from the little bit of watermelon in FLV Wild Melon, and I don’t need FLV Cucumber in there. I already plan to mix this [Malonee](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/283658#malonee_mwc_pool_party_by_buriedalive) recipe very soon. It looks like what it set out to be, Water-malone, only better. The only differences are taking out TFA Dragonfruit and replacing it with CAP Hibiscus, taking out CAP Double Apple and replacing it with CAP Cantaloupe, and adding some cooling. I’m going to make another Water-malone remix.

Seed Spittin Summer V1  **TASK 2**

Co. | Flavor | %
---|---|----
CAP | Fuji Apple | 4
FA | Red Summer | 2
FLV | Watermelon | 3
FLV | Wild Melon | 1
FW | Sweetener| 0.5
BCF | WS=23 (30%) | 0.25

Ditching the CAP Double Apple for the juicier and more subtle CAP Fuji Apple. Ditching the Dragonfruit for more realistic watermelon. Keeping the same FLV Watermelon/Wild Melon combo. Going a little easier on the sucralose sweetener. Adding cooling a la Melonee, but going easier on that as well. Betcha this shakes out to be a top-shelf watermelon vape even better than Water-malone.

# FLAVOUR ART

**Decano Tobacco**

It barely even tastes like tobacco, but it does taste like something that would add interesting notes to tobacco. It’s sweet and tastes like some kind of hybrid of tea-hay-tobacco, with some bright almost citrusy notes and also some darker anisey spice notes. But it doesn’t taste too earthy dirty or have that weird bell pepper off note that a bunch of FA tobaccos have. It’s not bad by any means, but I’ll be fine without it. **TRASH 1**

**Desert Ship**

**TRASH 2** True story, having this be the first DIY tobacco flavor I ever tried turned me off of all tobacco flavors for like two years before I tried FLV tobaccos. In retrospect it’s not *that* bad and doesn’t even come close to the 20 or 30 worst flavors I’ve tried. But it’s still pretty yucky. It mostly tastes like wet Camel cigarettes that someone tried and mostly failed to dry out in a toaster oven, then mixed up with a bunch of minced green bell pepper, a little ashy mud, and a hint of sweet vanilla. Not too dry, fairly smooth. Maybe in some kind of mix FA Desert Ship works, but after trying several over the years, I doubt it. But I don’t know why so many of these FA tobaccos have this weird green bell pepper note in there. Seems pretty disgusting to me, but I also don’t really like green bell pepper.  Think about it. What can you possibly make using a green bell pepper that wouldn’t be at least a little better if you used some other pepper instead?

**Doughnut Crispy**

As with the Custard Extra 2, another new-ish FA flavor that inexplicably tastes like it has corn in it.

Doughnut Crispy tastes like the skin of a donut wrapped around corn. Like an apple fritter but with corn instead, a corn fritter. It has the crispiness of a fritter vs the softness of a regular glazed donut. I think 2% might have been two high. That donut skin fritter thing is correct, so maybe a lower amount ditches the corn note and works for the outside of the donut or for a fritter base with support from some kind of bready flavor, maybe WF Sweet Bread. But I’d probably reach for WF Glazed Donut first, it’s pretty much the same thing but without the corn and not quite as crispy.

Already planning to keep it around at least long enough to mix [Baker’s Pipe](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/292531#baker_s_pipe_by_dippindabbin) and [Pony’d Up Donut](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/290828#pony_d_up_donut_raspberry_orange_by_dippindabbin). Might as well try [Africa](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/274299#africa_by_davidn2kl), which is a recipe too weird for me to taste in my head but not so weird that I don’t want to see what it tastes like in my mouth. **TASK 3**

**Dragon Fruit**

Very similar to FLV Dragonfruit, with that hibiscusy floral top note and sweeter almost pineapple body, but it’s thicker and a little more funky and ripe, while being a little more tart at the same time. More punchy overall in the fruit department. It tastes even more like something found in nature. Fairly juicy, especially for FA. Doesn’t taste like something I’d want to mix with creams because it seems like that would clash with the floral and ripe tropical goings-on here, doesn’t seem as suited to tea as FLV, leaves some question for me as far as what to do with it other than mixing with other fruit flavors, especially pineapple ones but really anything tropical, and making something fun, like some kind of real fruit punch.  

Speaking of mixing something fun and tropical, I need it for one of my new favorite recipes, [Deez Dragon Nuts](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/261981#deez_dragon_nuts_by_mixnjuice). **TASK 4**

I hate for that to be the only reason to keep it, but I don’t see anything else I want to mix that uses it.

**Dusk**

FA says “Dusk is a soft and very delicate tobacco, suitable for use all day long. Wisely combines the soft taste of licorice with a background of fine tobacco and wood.” It is indeed soft, and very smooth. I would call it an intricate, detailed flavor. The tobacco is indeed woody, and it doesn't have the weird green bell pepper-ish off note or awful chemical off notes I get from several FA tobaccos. The black licorice is there, but fairly light. If you love licorice, you might be very disappointed that it isn’t stronger. They didn’t say anything about dark chocolate or berry notes and this has a lot of chocolate and a little berry, as well as a hint of mint. More chocolate than licorice and maybe about the same berry as licorice. It’s not bad if you want a woody tobacco-chocolate-licorice-berry-mint flavor, but if you just want licorice and woody tobacco you might be let down. There’s nothing I want to make with it. **TRASH 3**  

**Eclipse**

FA says “Suddenly everything goes dark and began the journey in your emotions. Driven by the heat of the sun and pampered by the romance of the moon.” Nonsense name, nonsense description, nonsense flavor. It tastes like dark chocolate mint tobacco which sounds good to me. Like, really good. I have a couple of recipes that match that description on my to-mix list and I’m excited about them. Will probably be vaping the shit out of those. This flavor doesn’t really do it for me, though. The tobacco is smooth and fine - very dark and cigar wrapper-ish - and the mint is a nice little accent (not as bold as I want it to be), but it has a weird, soapy “laundry detergent” floral high note, and it’s fairly thin and dry. **TRASH 4**

**Egg Yolk (Cooked)**

 It’s not far off but it’s sharper than an egg yolk should be and a little gamey, like I don’t know what kind of bird this egg came from but it’s not a chicken. You know how if you accidentally overcook a hard-boiled egg, the yolk is gray on the outside? Imagine if you had to eat a pile of just that gray shit that’s caused by an interaction between sulfur in the egg white and iron in the egg yolk. And you don’t have any salt or pepper for it. Foul.  **TRASH 5**

**Euphoria**

“When the freshness of citrus is married with the harmony of exotic fruit and soft tobacco notes, a positively beautiful flavour emerges,” say FA. No, no it doesn’t. Or maybe it does, but this isn’t it. It tastes like wintergreen tobacco. There’s some kind of minty coolness to this and it tastes like wintergreen to me. I get the citrus and some other unidentifiable pruney fruit along with that smooth tobacco, but I get more of that wintergreen type of flavor upfront and the overall effect is like some kind of bizarro dirty root beer. I think there’s a hint of anise as well.   **TRASH 6**

**Florida Key Lime**

It fades, or I should say “settles down” quite a bit, so that’s something to plan for. Not particularly juicy but not dry either. It’s a fresh, very bright, natural tasting lime. Very little zest, more of lime juice with a medium thickness, syrupy sweet body, perhaps a bit overly sweet for key lime but a very nice lime.

I plan to mix The Commodore's Magnocean Water, Strawrora Limealis, Tea-ki, Roronoa Zoro, and 1-2-3 Tropico already.

I see four key lime pie recipes that all look good and two key lime cookies that look good, too. I don’t know what else to do besides mix them all and compare them.

[THE Key Lime Pie](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/288827#the_key_lime_pie_by_dippindabbin). FA Key Lime and VT Persian Lime together, plus WF Bavarian, JF Cheesecake Graham Crust, SSA Sweet Yogurt, and INW Yes We Cheesecake. **TASK 5**

[Key Lime n Piel](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/103553#key_lime_n_piel_updated_by_mrzigglesworth). Just the one lime, plus TFA Cheesecake Graham Crust, FA Graham Cracker, FA Meringue, CAP NY Cheesecake, and TFA Whipped Cream. **TASK 6**

[mlNikon’s Key Lime Pie](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/109385#mlnikon_s_key_lime_pie_mixinvixens_by_mixinvixens). Again with the TFA Cheesecake Graham Crust, plus FA Meringue, FA Milk, and VT Vanilla Buttercream Frosting. **TASK 7**

[Keys to the Kingdom](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/49453#keys_to_the_kingdom_by_flexmaster_kermit). The simplest of the four, with FW Graham Cracker, CAP NY Cheesecake, and a whopping 4% FA Meringue. **TASK 8**

[Key Lime Cookie - KLC](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/136662#key_lime_cookie_klc_by_rockyharlow). Just four ingredients, the Key Lime plus CAP Sugar Cookie, FW Hazelnut, and FA Meringue. **TASK 9**

[Key Lime Cookie](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/194874#key_lime_cookie_by_bob82fl), very similar, but with INW Yes We Cheesecake instead of FW Hazelnut. **TASK 10**

**Forest Fruit**

A dark berry (blackberry, blueberry, touches of raspberry and maybe currant) blend that’s a little top heavy and a little dry but has a nice sharp punch of flavor. I’ve always tasted a little something else besides berry in there, sometimes it seems more like a stone fruit (peach or apricot), sometimes I think it tastes more like pineapple.  Sweet, not super tart. Natural tasting, not candied. Drawback: serious throat hit, bordering on  harsh. Can be tamed with creams and other flavors, though.

Already plan to try 8 recipes that use it. Found a few more:

[Punkberry](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/160383#punkberry_by_runtdastardly). It’s that Kentucky Bourbon and Toasted Marshmallow combo for me, plus i’m curious about what a lot of Oba Oba does in there. **TASK 11**

[Sweet Sunset](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/261550#sweet_sunset_anne_by_mephistopheles). Can’t wait to see what that fresh-tasting VT Ginger Root does in there. **TASK 12**

[Venomous](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/142233#venomous_by_slushy). Blue raspberry, mixed berries, and... coconut? **TASK 13**

[Backwoods Berry](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/157413#backwoods_berry_by_ediblemalfunction). Looks candified with the additions of WF Bumbleberry and Sour Ball Candy, I’m into it. **TASK 14**

**Cream Fresh**

It really does smell like old man breath in the bottle (thanks for that Skiddlz), but vaping it, I get a sweet, smooth dairy cream without any off notes at 2%. Too far over 2% it starts to get a little sour and almost rancid tasting. It tastes thick but feels thin, if that makes any sense, I would say it’s more like a medium mouthfeel versus a full mouth feel and more of a mid-range flavor than a heavy base note though it will sort of attach itself to a lower base note. Not great for being the main or only cream in a creamy recipe, but great for milking up other creams or adding just a touch of mid-range dairy cream to a recipe.

Obviously I’m not throwing away FA Cream Fresh, even though I have a personal preference for so many other creams and milks over it. It’s in 713+ public recipes on ATF and I won’t even try to list all the recipes I need it for and I plan to try.

Just one more to add at the moment: [MacNut Banana Cream](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/217637#macnut_banana_cream_by_jakinbox). The additions of FA Honey and VT Macadamia Nut make this one look really interesting to me, just different enough from the usual banana cream things to make it worth checking out. **TASK 15**

**Fig Fresh**

I’d say this is an excellent ingredient, but not a great fig. There’s something a little fresh figgish about it but it might be more the power of suggestion than the actual flavor. It’s more like an unclear sweet juicy fruit flavor that doesn’t taste like anything specific, but has elements of peach and pear. Very sweet, almost syrupy. It’s quite bright and even a little floral. Not a perfumy floral, just a natural fresh fruit floral. Has a little bit of throat to it, like a peach throat hit. Has some darkness to it down low, which is where it is a little figgy. Seems like FA Fresh Fig could do neat things to just about any fresh fruit flavor, especially giving them a natural-tasting sweetness. If your fruit isn’t sweet enough, but you don’t want to use sweetener or make it taste candy-like, a little of this seems perfect for that. Definitely not a dark, dried fig like you’d usually want with tobaccos and such. Kinda juicy.

Already plan to mix this fantastic-looking [Port Royale](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/223346#port_royale_fig_stachio_custard_tobacco_by_fadedjay1). Frankly, there’s not much else out there I really want to do with it but I would like to experiment and see how it pairs with some other ingredients. So, I’ll try mixing small samples two-flavor combos of 2% FA Fig plus:

2% FA Indian Mango **TASK 16**

2% FLV Sweet Coconut **TASK 17**

1% TFA Papaya **TASK 18**

1.5% FA Pomegranate **TASK 19**

3% VT Blood Orange Champagne **TASK 20**

2% OOO Powdered Sugar **TASK 21**

3% WF Sour Watermelon Candy **TASK 22**

2.5% WF Strawberry Gummy Candy  **TASK 23**

And 1.5% WF Thai Apple **TASK 24**

Some of those will no doubt be bad, but watch one or more of them be a two-flavor banger or at least the starting place for something incredible.

**Fuji Apple**

The fresh, crisp apple that everyone has. It has its downsides. It’s a little sharp. It has a peel note on it that runs a little spicy. It fades a bit. It’s a little thin, not a ton of body to it, but juicy. But it’s a great sweet and tart and sweet and I said sweet twice on purpose, fairly clean and accurate apple flavor without any real problems except maybe that almost-spicy peel bothers you, or you don’t like how sharp it is without steeping. Does have a little throat hit when you use it at a higher % as the main or only apple in an apple mix, but drops off over time. Vibrant without steeping. Sweet enough to act as an sweetening additive to a fruit mix, juicy enough to juice up other flavors. The bit of fading it does can be a good thing if you want a background apple and plan for it.

Here’s the thing. I think JF Fuji is a very, very similar flavor. I’m not even sure I could tell them apart in a lot of mixes, but when you try them side by side there are some noticeable differences. One, JF is smoother and not as sharp. Still sharp, just not quite as sharp. While there’s some peel there I don’t get that errant hint of spice to it. JF is also a bit sweeter, which is just nuts because FA is already really sweet.

I think I’m going to toss FA Fuji in favor of JF very soon, but before I do, I’m just going to check it as a sub in some mixes and make sure that’s as good an idea as I think it is. Starting with the original [Strap-On](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/6487#strap_on_by_id10_t).

Slightly Better Strap-on **TASK 25**

Co.| Flavor | %
---|---|----
JF | Fuji Apple| 2
FA | Red Summer | 3
FA | Red Touch |3

**Gin**

Mostly just juniper flavor. Which is of course the main thing with gin, but certainly not the only thing. It’s not even boozy, but it’s a little harsh, which I guess could substitute for boozy. Some odd sweetness on the tail end but I think that might just be VG poking through a thin, top-heavy flavor and contrasting with the evergreen flavor. Also it’s pretty dry, like it would definitely need something wetter like cucumber or cactus.  But if you just want to add a little juniper to something to imply a bit of gin, it’ll probably do. There’s a little bit of something lemony about the soft base here, not much, but maybe something to be aware of if you’re mixing gin and lemon you might not need as much lemon as you think you do. And it tastes like a tiny bit of it might do some interesting things to all sorts of fruits. It might be the secret ingredient you need to make a fruit really pop.

I don’t need this. I don’t even need to mention the expensive, difficult to obtain, super-amazing Flavormonks gins. I don’t need it because even FLV Juniper Gin and VT Botanical Gin are so superior to FA’s. **TRASH 7**

**Grape Concord**

Basically grape skin without the juicy sweet inside of the grape. A more natural dark grape, with just the tiniest bit of purple artificial grape in there. Has that tannic grape skin note, and is a little tart, but also quite floral, not at all sweet, and has an unpleasant bitter floral aftertaste. I also found it to be a little harsh. Not at all juicy.  Probably very useful in a small quantity to make another grape flavor taste more like hand-picked fresh grape, but not very good as a solo grape. Nothing I want to mix uses this. **TRASH 8**

**Grapefruit**

It’s not inaccurate at all for a kind of yellow grapefruit, definitely not a red one, but it is thin and not especially juicy. It’s appropriately bitter and has a crisp tartness but lacks that base depth. It’s a light flavor that tastes like it might get swallowed up in a mix as a grapefruit, but would provide a tart and bitter accent.

I could do without it - I have other grapefruit flavors I like more - if I didn’t already have plans to try a couple of recipes that use it. In the meantime, this [White Tea with Grapefruit](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/193195#white_tea_with_grapefruit_by_rug_ly) recipe caught my eye. I don’t have the OoO White Tea it mix it and I’m sure it’s best with that, but I’m still digging the idea of grapefruit with tea and thinking that FA Grapefruit being less aggressive than some of the others makes it an excellent choice for that. I have an idea. I’m going to sub 10% TFA Sweet Tea for the White Tea, and add 0.25% WS-23 for a little touch of refreshing coolness. **TASK 26**

**Green Tea**

Nasty. BURNT. Tastes like you left green tea boiling and ruined it. **TRASH 9**

**Guava**

Bitter musk cologne. More like a manly cologne than a floral perfume. It doesn’t taste like any kind of fruit. The closest it comes to any part of any fruit that I can imagine is lime pith. Not lime peel, just the bitter spongy white part lining the rind. **TRASH 10**

**Ham (Cooked)**

It’s like the slime from a can of Spam but at least Spam can pork goop is salty, this has no salt, just pig slime, it’s repulsive. It’s full flavored and thick yet oily textured as well which just makes it that much grosser. It also tastes very slightly sulphuric. **TRASH 11**

**Hazel Grove**

Realistic nut, very lightly sweet, really has some nut meat body to it, slightly roasty, not thin like many FA flavors, not too dry, around 1.25% starts to get a little bit of a green nut skin off note so stay at or below 1% and you’re good.  

I would be tossing this if I didn’t want to try [Top Tier Cookie](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/248694#top_tier_cookie_by_sensory_overload), but since it’s sticking around for now, [Amandette](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/213193#amandette_by_saspi) - buttery soft almond cookie with hazelnut-vanilla filling looks pretty good. **TASK 27**

**Honey**

From experience, FA Honey works pretty well if all you want is an accent of honey, but it can be hard to work with. It’s very strong and potent, and it gets weird fast. You don’t want to go too far over 0.25%, which is plenty for a honey accent. If you do, it likely will be more than an accent and likely will not taste good. For the most part it tastes like plain clover honey at 0.25%. It runs a little to the floral side, but not a perfumey floral, more of deeper, lower floral note. Tends to sit on top of a recipe a bit and stand out as separate from the mix. Not exceptionally teeth hurtingly sweet like honey should be, but sweet. Room note is a bit weird; it instead of cat piss like TFA Honey, it’s more like the pee of a diabetic after drinking tons of coors light; definitely a hint of ammonia, but also a tad yeasty, and sweet-smelling. I don’t get that yeasty ammonia when vaping it at a low %, but it’s a little noticeable when walking into a cloud and if you push the flavor too high that will be almost all you taste, floral sweet yeasty ammonia.

I currently need this for one of my all-time favorite recipes, [Notorious](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/37519#notorious_by_notcharlesmanson), although maybe someday I’ll try to make this even better and will use a different honey to do it. **TASK 28**

It’s also in the MacNut Banana Cream I just added to the list today. One more: [Honey Butter Ice Cream](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/134228#honey_butter_ice_cream_by_folkart). That looks good and the praise in the reviews sold it to me. But I will not be making a dilution of FA Honey, I’m perfectly capable of dripping just 0.05% into a 50ml. **TASK 29**

**Hypnotic Myst**

“Complex and intriguing, sweet but gentle. A good vape after a tough day.” is FA’s entirely unhelpful description. It tastes like a mostly orangy but indistinct citrus and some soft sweet cream, or at least a really creamy feel and body without a distinctly dairy cream taste, with an oddly bitter undertone that might be tea but also isn’t directly an identifiable tea taste to me. It’s weird. It’s strangely both dry and very smooth, especially for something so citrusy. I don’t know what to do with it for sure because it isn’t exactly anything relatable, but I could definitely see playing with it up against anything orange or tea. Three recipes on ATF use it. None of them I want to make, not because of the Myst, but because of the other ingredients. **TRASH 12**

New Flavor Count: 2,461
