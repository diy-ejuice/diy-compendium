#Heartland Vapes

**Vixen**

Now that they have more competition and are no longer mixing house juice to order, things have gone downhill. But back in 2014-2015, when there were only two vape jobs in town instead of at least half a dozen, one place was by far the busiest. You could not go in there any time of day and not have to stand in line, more than half the people in front of you were always all buying the same thing. This weird watermelon-cinnamon juice. Tasted like cinnamon red hots candy and watermelon hard candy at the same time, with too much sweetener and a little weird chemical off note. I didn’t care for it, but so many people were hooked on that stuff, it was bizarre. I began to wonder if they put meth in it. I found a better shop before they stopped making it, so I’m not sure if it ended with a bang or a whimper, but some years later I saw Vixen - watermelon-cinnamon flavoring - for sale at Heartland Vapes and got curious enough to order it. I already knew that vape shop sourced their nicotine base from Heartland. Recognized it instantly. Sure enough, the juice that took the town by storm was just Vixen from Heartland Vapes plus Super Sweet. But again, I never liked it. **TRASH 1**

#Herrlan

**Chocoshake**

Chocolate potpourri. Seriously, tasted like eating chocolate covered potpourri. I’m not exaggerating. It made me gag and choke. **TRASH 2**

**Cranberry**

Slightly floral, as well as weirdly warm, but also very tart yet sweet and does taste like cranberry. Starts off puckery tart, like acidic, and a little harsh and warm, kinda floral, then with a much sweeter, softer base where the cranberry kicks in, but the whole thing together just tastes a little like medicine. Maybe this is what actual cranberry juice tastes like, without all the grape, apple, and pear added like the cranberry juice you usually get at the grocery store, but it’s not super pleasant to me. Also, it seems like straight cranberry juice would be insanely cranberry-forward, whereas the actual cranberry here is sort of soft, not especially bold at all, and pretty much takes a backseat to just straight tartness. I could see using a little of it to tart up something else, but it really needs more in-your-face cranberry flavor. **TRASH 3**

**Lebkuchen**

This is sweet ginger potpourri. It was really hard to choke down to the point where I could rewick. I only tried it at 2%, but that’s in the middle of the recommended use range for the stuff and I wasn’t brave enough to re-dilute it and try again, it was just too terrible. I’m traumatized by it. **TRASH 4**

**Schokolade Vollmilch**

It’s thick and chocolatey but it also tastes like a fart. It’s literally the closest thing to something tasting like actual crap that I’ve ever vaped, usually when I say something tastes like crap I just mean it’s bad, but this is poo. Rich creamy chocolate covered scheisse. The more of it I vaped trying to get my wick dry enough to change it, the less it tasted like chocolate covered feces and the more it tasted more like a chocolate covered really musty chocolate covered fruit like a prune, but still. Nasty. **TRASH 5**

#HiLiQ

**Coffee**

Stale, slightly sweetened coffee with a good bit of flower garden dirt in it. **TRASH 6**

**Matcha Cream**

Have not tried this, will do a 1.5% sample. **TASK 1**

**Red Lychee**

Does not taste like a lycee. There’s a little bit of fruity tartness in there, but it bizarrely tastes like sweetened rosewater . Nothing offensive, just not what I was expecting at all. In the bottle it smells as much like lychee as any of the other lychee flavors, maybe a little more berry-like, when vaped it’s a full-bodied rosy floral with just a bit of sweet-tart fruitiness to it. **TRASH 7**

#Inawera

**555 Gold**

It’s mostly roasted peanut, very nutty, with a tiny bit of brighter mild tobacco upfront and a hint of smokiness. Some caramelly sweetness. Kinda dry but has almost an oily mouthfeel, like peanut butter. INW website also mentions vanilla notes but I’m not finding them, not at 1.5%. Not a strong flavor at 1.5%, but still full-bodied.

I need it for a couple of favorite recipes, [Ruyan Butter](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/214258#ruyan_butter_by_mindfloodz) **TASK 2** and [Screamin’ Demon 555](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/218855-screamin_demon_555). **TASK 3**

It is also used in three other recipes, and now in line behind those goes:

[555](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/253286-555_%F0%9F%92%AB). A very simple nutty tobacco custard. **TASK 4**

[Bacco Custard](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/255163-bacco_custard) another simple custard tobacco, one that looks more vanilla & custard and less nuts and tobacco. **TASK 5**

[Empire](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/296643-empire). Kind of a banana nut bread RY4 thing. **TASK 6**

[For The Children](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/315733-for_the_children). Described as a “sweet, creamy funky banana with a subtle hint of nuts and light tobacco” and looks to fit the bill. **TASK 7**

**Airwaves**

Apparently it’s supposed to be a blackcurrant mint gum with some menthol and eucalyptus in it that’s popular in Europe? I’ve never tried it that, but it this flavor tastes mostly like the color purple. The flavor is very dark sweet-tart berry raspberry mixed with the skin of a purple grape but much sweeter. There’s a cool mint underneath but I can’t tell what kind of mint it is at 1%. Full saturated flavor but not necessarily a gum chewing gum texture, more like a juicy thick bubblegum texture. At 2% the tartness on top ramps up considerably and there’s a bit of earthiness to that berry I didn’t notice before, though I’m still thinking raspberry and dark purple grape skin gummy candy. Had a blackberry merlot once that kind of tasted like this, but that was sweet garbage and this is much more tart. The mint here is clearly pepperminty and the coolness is more mentholated, and there’s a touch of vanilla filling it out. I didn’t get any eucalyptus at 1% but there’s a vegetal quality to this at 2% that I guess could be eucalyptus. It’s super weird but it’s interesting and very refreshing. 4% is not horrible or anything, but the berry actually gets a bit overwhelmed by what I can best describe as like menthol with extra menth and it’s a little medicine-y and definitely eucalpytus-y. Seems like this is best in the 1 to 2% range. I don’t have a clue what to do with this, but you might play around with raspberries, grapes, blackberries, and things like that and see what happens. **TRASH 8**

**Aloe**

Tastes like one of those aloe drinks. It’s fruity, kind of citrusy, and much sweeter than cactus but otherwise similar. Very smooth, very wet. A little of the weak side I think if you want it to be the main flavor; 2% doesn’t seem like too much at all.

I’ll try this [Brujeria](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/190360-brujeria) recipe that’s all-INW cactus-y stuff - Aloe, Prickly Pear, Cactus, and Dragon Fruit. **TASK 8**

**AM4A**

Smooth golden pipe tobacco. Some spice notes. Thick and full-bodied, bordering on creamy and rich. Something about this is not quite coconut but something coconut-esque, like TFA Red Oak’s coconut ish thing it has going on. Also has some darker, honeyed prunish sweetness.
Already planning to try three or four recipes that use it, one more won’t hurt - [Euphora](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/115430-euphora). If only I had one of those fancy e-pipes for it. **TASK 9**

**American Dream**

They named it American Dream like it’s something awesome. They described it as “Sweet American tobacco flavour with hints of Vanilla and Caramel” like it’s an RY4. But I really just get a light peanutty and slightly sweet tobacco with no discernable vanilla or caramel, with a smooth, creamy feel. They might as well have called it INW Boring Dystopia... Maybe it wasn’t so poorly named after all. It’s not a terrible flavor, but if you’re going to call something “American Dream” you should really have it come out guns blazing. **TRASH 9**

**Anton Apple**

Natural green apple, mostly. Fairly clean, none of that bunch of that acetone or grass business that many of the green apples have, though it tastes at 2% like it might go nail polish remover higher, or it could go floral or grassy, not sure. Some people have reported acetone off notes with it at 3%, I do not get them at 2%. Sweet and bright, with a crisp little bite of tart skin in the middle rather than right on top. Lingering sweet finish. Main issue with this is that it’s not the most in-your-face green apple flavor, it’s a little on the soft or mild side, but that could be a good thing, depending on what you’re using it for. I’ve tried it in a mix at 2.5% and it did show up without off-notes, but wasn’t really the main flavor. Also a small amount of it can make a big difference in brightness and tartness, but still not give a full apple flavor. Also it’s quite thin, almost a green apple juice without that real thick mealy apple body, yet also not very juicy. It’s a little dry and very slightly harsh, just enough that I want to mix it with something juicy and avoid other slightly harsh ingredients.

This is in a couple of recipes I’ve already planned to try. The one I’m most excited about is Take Me Home by DanielTheVapeMan, and here’s another of Daniel’s recipes using it: [Venusaur](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/250501-venusaurgreen_and_red_fruits). **TASK 10**

**Apricots**

This is not good. An authentic under ripe apricot, maybe? Bold flavor that mostly tastes like an apricot, but not nearly as soft and sweet as it should be, and some peachy floral and a sharp green bitter vegetal edge like a peach so underripe that it’s still hard. **TRASH 10**

**Arabesque**

This is a very strange, very busy flavor. I think it’s supposed to taste like Camel cigarettes, but I don’t think it does, at all. It mostly tastes herbal tea and lemon mixed with a spicy tobacco to it. The first thing I taste is warm, nutmeggy spice, followed by a bit of lemony citrus and somewhat minty black tea. Underneath that, the body is a sweet, moist tobacco, and in the finish some cinnamon, and it starts to get a little bready. Like a cinnamon roll. For real it’s like a cinnamon roll topped with tobacco, lemon zest, tea leaves, and nutmeg. It’s pretty nuts. I don’t know what the heck to do with INW Arabesque, but it’s not as terrible as I’m probably making it sound. There’s not really any terrible off-notes, there’s just a lot going on and it doesn’t seem like all of these things really go together. **TRASH 11**

**Arabic Tobacco**

Pretty much tastes like drinking cold day-old hot chocolate that someone used as an ashtray the night before, like a bad start to the morning after a wild Christmas party. It’s got a strong and overly sour dairy flavor, creamy hot cocoa-type chocolate, and a little accent of smokey and slightly ashy tobacco. INW Arabic wouldn’t be bad if it were just a hot cocoa-smokey tobacco combo, that actually sounds pretty good to me, but that spoiled milk flavor is strong and pretty gnarly, like it turned my stomach a bit. I’m pretty sure there’s some butyric acid in there and I can’t understand why that would be a component in any tobacco flavor. **TRASH 12**

**Banana**

Runts, with hints of something like under-ripe banana, but the very slight green notes that taste just a little more “grassy” than underripe banana. **TRASH 13**

**Biscuit**

Dry and sharp, yet buttery. Can be coconutty - I have to use it fairly low to avoid getting a coconut off note from it, and there are people who are more sensitive to the gammalactone or whatever is in there that’s coconutty - they will taste coconut in it at any concentration. But I don’t get any coconut with it mixed at 0.75%, which is about as high I think as you probably ever need to go with INW Biscuit. It’s definitely a full-flavored vape at three quarters of a percent. So, it’s strong. People also say it takes over a mix.I don’t think it does quite that, but it does stick out in one with an annoying identifiability sometimes. It also makes me really thirsty for some reason. It’s dry, but how thirsty it leaves me feeling goes beyond this bit of dryness. Maybe I’m weird and others don’t notice this. Anyway, it’s a full-bodied thick buttery yet dry nondescript darker cookie-like pastry flavor with a bit of sharp nuttiness to it.

One of these days I’m going to toss the INW Biscuit for the very similar but notably better Jungle Flavors Biscuit. I can’t think of a reason to ever build a recipe with INW Biscuit when JF Biscuit exists. But, today is not that day, because I don’t think it works well as a 1:1 substitute, you’d definitely need between 1% and 2% JF per 0.75% INW, and not having that exact ratio down could mess up some recipes already on the to-mix list.

Here are some more that look too good to pass up:

[Wookiee Cookie](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/280703-wookiee_cookie) - just a simple cookies and cream that looks finely crafted. **TASK 11**

[Triple C](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/311038-triple_c). Caramel cookie custard - I need to see how that SSA Milky Caramel Fudge works in there. **TASK 12**

[Monstered Cookie](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/271047-monstered_cookie). Cookie with almond and orange marmalade. Unique profile that looks like it probably works very well. **TASK 13**

[RY4 Schnobi’s Revenge Reloaded](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/274064-ry4_schnobi%C2%B4s_revenge_reloaded). It’s the TFA Bavarian Cream/French Vanilla Deluxe for me, but the tobacco trio and other ingredients look great, too. **TASK 14**

**Black Cherry Tobacco**

My only real beef with this is that it should be called Black Cherry FOR Tobacco rather than black cherry tobacco. I can’t find the tobacco in it anywhere. Not even a little touch of that “dirty” that we’re sometimes supposed to pretend is tobacco, like with TFA RY4 Double or FA Soho. It boldly tastes like sweet, dark cherries with a lot of body and without any off notes at all, but instead of being juicy like a fresh cherry, it’s quite dry. Seems like it would be perfect for mixing with tobacco because it wouldn’t make the tobacco soggy, but in a fruit mix it would need other ingredients to bring that juiciness. Hence black cherry FOR tobacco, though it seems like it would also be great in other settings as long as it’s not being counted on for juiciness.

It is not at all a bad flavor, but I don’t need it or feel inspired to do something with it. **TRASH 14**

**Black Cherry For Pipe**

Although Black Cherry is the first thing I taste, it mostly gives way to a dark pipe tobacco that mostly takes over, though it stays a bit fruity throughout, it becomes more figgy toward the end. Although the dark, sweet cherry isn’t as prominent as the tobacco, and I want a little more of it, I don’t get any of the usually cherry pitfalls or any other off notes at all. It tastes like it’s just INW Dark for Pipe with INW Black Cherry Tobacco on top. Seriously it just tastes like black cherry pipe tobacco, and is good enough to vape standalone, which sets it apart from most other cherry flavors. If you’re not a tobacco person? Sorry boutcha. If you are a tobacco person and you’ve put off trying this because cherry is scary, don’t worry, it’s great. Full-flavored at 1.5%.

Can’t wait to try this reportedly bangin two-flavor mix: [Casablanca](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/64558-casablanca_aka_duly_noted_for_pipe_1), a cherry vanilla pipe tobacco. **TASK 15**

**Blackcurrant**

Graham (RIP) told me that he thinks Currant tastes in general like “grape with an extra chromosome.” I think that description fits this particular blackcurrant flavor more than any others. It tastes like grape koolaid made from a very questionable water supply, with less sugar than kool aid should have, because it’s sweet but not as sweet as kool aid. It’s not actually tart. It’s not floral either. Instead it tastes a little acerbic in a vinegar-ish way. It also tastes like there’s something just a bit savory in there, like broth. Grape kool aid with a few drops of vinegar and low sodium beef or chicken broth in it. It’s gross, especially with that underlying grape kool aid taste. Maybe it’s a perfect authentic blackcurrant, but gross. Seems like it could do something interesting to another grape or berry in a low amount, but I don’t know about using it as the main flavor for anything.

It’s probably getting tossed soon, but I want to try this [Blue Raspberry Slush](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/281098-blue_raspberry_slush) first. **TASK 16**

**Black for Pipe**

Very dark, almost rich, kind of smokey but not like FA Black Fire or FLV Sweet & Smokey-level smokey. Hints of anise and fig-like notes. Damp but not too moist, definitely a pipe tobacco.

I need it for [Brigade 2506](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/55565-brigade_2506), [None More Black](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/63181-none_more_black), and [Apricaught Me Slippin](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/54094-apricaught_me_slippin). Three favorite recipes, all by ChemicalBurnVictim. **TASK 17**, **TASK 18**, and **TASK 19**

It’s in about half a dozen things I’m already slated to try. Here’s three more to add to the list:

[Schnobi’s Viking Tobacco](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/304215-schnobi%C2%B4s_viking_tobacco) that uses SSA Scandinavian Fruits with a trio of INW tobaccos. **TASK 20**

[Cinder & Smoke](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/136385-cinder_and_smoke), a Boba’s Bounty-inspired mix. **TASK 21**

[Camel Driver](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/193255-camel_driver), tobacco with rum and dates. **TASK 22**

**Bloody Orange**

The one thing I noticed about this is that it’s lemony. It’s quite lemony, right up front. Beyond that, I get a clear, sweet, juicy, flavorful blood orange body, with all that ripe earthy red sweetness that sets a blood orange apart from other oranges. I did notice a little bit of a bitter, pity note, right between the lemon and blood orange. It seems like INW Bloody Orange would be perfect for a blood orange lemonade recipe, since it already comes with some lemon, but the lemonyness could be distracting in another setting. There are no recipes using it that I want to make. **TRASH 15**

**Blue Dwarf**

I can’t say I’ve ever chewed a blueberry gum ball, but if I did, I assume it would taste exactly like that. Everything about INW Blue Dwarf from the sweet candy shell top notes to the chewy thick base just hollers GUMBALL, but it’s also clearly a blueberry candy flavor. Don’t know what to do with this, maybe add it to a fruity ice cream and say it’s the blue gumball eyeballs on one of those cartoon-character ice cream truck ice cream bars, I guess. Some sort of blue Smurf Ice Cream might even be what it’s based on, I’m not sure. It’s definitely not found in nature, and sometimes, that’s ok. But, I’ll be alright without this little blue oddball of a flavor. **TRASH 16**

**Blueberry**

Candy blueberry upfront with a rotten blueberry medicine backnote. The medicine part is weird, it’s like menthol without any cooling or mint, which doesn’t leave much obviously, except some weirdness. But worse than that is the rotten part. It’s like a musty armpit. **TRASH 17**

**Bubble Gum (yc)**

More of a dry chalky baseball card type of gum than a big juicy piece of Hubba Bubba, but hard to find anything else wrong with it, seems to have a touch of sweet vanilla sticking out in the finish, but nothing offensive there. It’s a bit one dimensional but that one dimension has some depth to it, it’s more basey than a bunch of other gums. Flavor is a little soft, like it’s already had a bit of the in your face bubblegum taste chewed out of it, and it’s dry, but there’s some chalky sweet body to it as well. It’s certainly not objectionable as a single-flavor bubble gum. Appropriately sweet.

I’m gonna give this [Guava Melon Bubblegum](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/172606-guava_melon_bubblegum) a mix. I’m a sucker for CAP Sweet Guava and I love the idea of it mixed with melon and bubblegum. I’m imagining that it tastes a bit like prickly pear fruit. **TASK 23**

New Flavor Count: 2,316
