TASK OR TRASH - Each flavor gets assigned at least one task or it goes in the trash.

#INAWERA

**Milk Chocolate**

Accidentally skipped over this one last time. Supposedly the old version was amazing. I don't know, never bought it. But the reformulated one tastes very weird. I can kind of tell that it's supposed to be chocolate, but it's very musky or earthy, like dirt. Some people get an off note they describe as band-aids or latex, but it tastes more like dirt to me. **TRASH 1**

**Natural Grapefruit**

I haven't tried this. It might be the same as INW Grapefruit (but probably not INW White Grapefruit). Will do a 2% sample. **TASK 1**

**Natural Mint**

Has some natural mint herbaceous edge to the finish but seems less natural than SSA Garden Mint (best natural-tasting spearmint I've tried). Also seems to be more of a mixed mint than a straight up spearmint, starts out with a burst of peppermint and then more of a spearmint body that's a little bit candy sweet and mint-extract-ish before you get that hint of vegetal.

After trying a bunch of mints flavors, it looks like most of the recipes that use it could probably be better with a different one. But there are few I need to try before scrapping it.

[Black Blossom Tea](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/115859-black_blossom_tea) it's a floral sweet tea with a bit of mint. It looks heavily floral, but at the same time, the trio of floral flavors it uses - CAP Hibiscus, TFA Cherry Blossom, TFA Honeysuckle - are the gentlest, least flowers-all-up-in-your-face aggressive florals. I think I'm gonna dig it. **TASK 2**

[Arctic Queen](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/60268-arctic_queen) a simple, frigid mint tobacco by Fear. **TASK 3**

[Apricot Julep Tobacco](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/111671-apricot_julep_tobacco_yearofmixing). Looks like it tastes like the Kentucky Derby, minus the horse crap. **TASK 4**

**Nugat**

Mostly a very sweet honey cream. It's thick and full with a gooey sweetness and a little bit of non-descript slightly peanutty nuttiness. This would make it seem like a great nougat flavor, but I'm getting a one-two punch of funky off notes here. There's a solid hit of butyric barfiness and just a bit of a weird rubbery chocolate in there. **TRASH 2**

**Orange**

Potent. At 0.25%, tastes like candied orange peel. Not orange candy, but candied orange peel. No recipes using it on ATF, and a prefer VT Orange Marmalade for this sort of flavor. **TRASH 3**

**Peach**

Depending on how much is used and what it's mixed with, it either tastes like a real peach or peach rings candy. Higher concentrations are full bodied and bold, with a chewy, thick texture that's only slightly separate from the more peach candy top note. Lower concentrations are softer but still full bodied and fairly robust, taste much more like a natural sweet yellow peach, and are able to shine through as a peach in a recipe. I do get some very mild irritation with this one but nowhere near TFA/CAP Juicy Peach or several others.

I need it for Fuzzy Strap-On. And it's in a couple of recipes I've planned to try, including one that's already mixed and just waiting to be cracked open. Here's one more I don't think I'll regret shaking up: [Peach Smoovie](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/23266-peach_smoovie) **TASK 5**

**Peanuts**

It's not a terrible flavor - tastes like candied peanuts (almost honey roasted, but not quite), but it has a metallic aftertaste that's too distracting for me. **TRASH 4**

**Pear**

INW Pear was reformulated years ago, which is why you see a lot of old recipes using it and not as many new ones. The new version of INW Pear isn't terrible, but it isn't great either. I didn't get anything I'd specifically call an off-note, but the whole thing is a little off. It tastes almost as much like yellow and green apples as a pear. I can see how it's supposed to be a pear, but also it's like it's got some green apple tartness upfront, but not really a crisp flavor, more like an overripe or oxidized and soft or starting-to-go-bad green apple or yellow apple body. Like a green apple skin wrapped around a yellow apple-pear hybrid. Also, it's a bit throaty. **TRASH 5**

**Pharaoh**

Bizarre. Bright, citrusy tea flavor with a dull (not cold), mint accent. I saw it described as a “mix of Turkish and Virginia tobaccos” and as an “old American cigarette flavor” as if it's supposed to be a Camel cigarette and just... no. Not remotely. There's maybe something vaguely tobacco-ish about it, but really not much more than “tea leaves and tobacco leaves are both leaves,” as it really, really tastes more like black tea with hints of lemon and mint. I wouldn't call INW Pharoah unpleasant at all, but for something that's supposed to be tobacco, it's very strange. **TRASH 6**

**Pinacolada**

Virgin pina colada. No rum taste. Nice sweet and natural pineapple that tastes like INW Pineapple, sits on top over the coconut. Balance is pretty even but leans a little more coconuttty. The coconut here is interesting. It's very bright “white” and clean tasting, but on the thin side. The coconut base tastes like sweetened coconut with a slight vanilla off note and feels kind of soft and fluffy rather than rich and creamy like coconut cream, as a result it kind of makes me think of a coconut-flavored marshmallow dipped in pineapple juice, rather than a pina colada, but it's an entirely pleasant vape. How bright it is compared to most other coconuts is different, it's like comparing a bright fruity vanilla like FA Tahiti to a darker, richer vanilla like FA Vanilla Bourbon. Could maybe add some Hard Candy and turn it into a pina colada candy, like one of those gourmet suckers. Could turn it into a halfway decent pina colada with just some rum, but it seems like to get a really good one you'd be beefing up the pineapple, creaming up the coconut, and adding rum, and at that point you might as well just DIY the pina colada from the ground up.

Because of my love for the OG In a Godda Da Vida recipe, I have to try Slushy's In a Godda Colada. But that's already on the list. I made a couple of recipes with it back in 2016 but those are ancient history and I'd do it entirely differently if I had known then what I do now. What else can I do with it? I'll take page from Graham's Magma Carter recipe for a strawberry-pina colada gummy candy and see if I can create strawberry-pina colada hard candy.

**Pineapple**

INW Pineapple is very juicy, sweet, fairly natural tasting, and doesn't have anything I would call an off-note. No harshness. But it does have some cons: It's very weak for INW, so it's less cost-effective than many of their other flavors. 5% and higher is not unreasonable, even at 5% you might want to back it up with another pineapple. Another con, it's fairly thin and one-noted, not a thick/fleshy pineapple or complex flavor. Watery. That can work for beverage pineapple juice but doesn't do much for other thicker pineapple applications without help.

This is used in so many favorite recipes and recipes that I've already planned to try that I won't bother listing or counting them. Adding a couple of new recipes that just dropped last month:

[Maui Mango](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/maui_mango) mango-pineapple-mint. **TASK 7**

[Twist it all up!](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/twist_it_all_up) I love the look of this simple, four-ingredient pineapple-coconut-lime mix. **TASK 8**

**Pink Panther**

Fairly strong, 1% is plenty flavorful. INW calls it “strawberry, rhubarb, and red currant.” So I was a little scared because of the rhubarb and I've had some run-ins with rhubarb before, but this is nice. I don't get an easily identifiable strawberry or red currant, just a thick and very sweet berry thing. If I had to guess I'd say it tastes more like a raspberry than anything else, but not exactly raspberry. Syrupy sweet almost candy raspberry, like super duper sweet, but that little bitterness from the fairly subtle rhubarb counterbalances it, and provides a great contrast. It is pretty good just by itself, but none of the recipes using it look like things I want to mix, and I don't know what to do with it. **TRASH 7**

**Plum**

I heard this was great before it got reformulated a few years ago, but didn't have a chance to try it. This new version sucks though. It's weird and does not taste like plum. It's like you wrapped fruity cereal in a grape skin and garnished it with a flower petal. It's a bit floral on top, not in a perfumy way but literally like a flower, not sure the specific flavor but maybe cherry blossom, like a flower that grows on a tree. It's got some waxy dark fruity tartness under that flavor that's very much like just the skin of a dark, thick-skinned grape. Maybe plum skin? But skin, regardless. It's in no way juicy and the sweet yet dry body and finish is very much like a fruity cereal minus the citrus. I will say that the cereal aspect is less pronounced at 0.75% than I remember it being at 1%. But it still tastes very much like grape skins and cherry blossoms and is still quite dry for what I think should be a juicy fruit. **TRASH 8**

**Prickly Pear**

I love this because it has some of that INW Cactus juiciness, but it doesn't taste like INW Cactus more than just a teeny bit. It does get a little floral over 2%, below that it's mostly just like an apple-melon-pear juice thing with a little guava-like tartness and funkiness to it. Not exactly like a Prickly Pear fruit, but similar, and sweet, and yes, pretty juicy. If I see this in a recipe I know there's a good chance I'm in for a real treat of refreshing fruity goodness.

Seven or eight recipes that use it are already slated for mixing, but one of my own hasn't come up yet because the flavors it uses haven't come up yet. [Prickly Pearry](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/195175-prickly_pearry). I'm excited to try that again. Maybe I'll think of a way to improve but probably not. It's a really good recipe. **TASK 9**

**Purple Gum**

Soapy. Tried it at 1%, 2%, and 3% and they all tasted awfully soapy to me, like a floral, laundry detergent or drier sheet soapiness, just underneath some vague candied fruitiness. **TRASH 9**

**Purple Rain**

It definitely tastes pastel purple. INW calls it violet and vanilla. I swear I get a little bit of lavender in there as well, and it's a bit odd because I don't think violet has any business being as tart as this is, but if you're into florals, you'll probably love it. It's like tart purple flowers on a sweet and slightly creamy vanilla base. A little throat with the florals but not harsh, and the vanilla finish smooths it over. Maybe a little perfume-y but not out of line for a serious floral. Very potent 1% is plenty of flavor.

I only have a small amount of this one left, probably just enough to mix Kopel's Jazz Hands recipe. If I have enough left after that or decide to buy more, I'll try [Purpled Rain](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/222176-purpled_rain) too. **TASK 10**
