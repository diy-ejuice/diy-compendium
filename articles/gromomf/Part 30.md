## CAPELLA

**Custard Cake**

Update. My first thought on trying CAP Custard Cake for the first time was “someone is going to create an awesome Tres Leches cake out of this.” So of course I had to try one... but it tasted just a little gross to me. I hoped the barfy butyric note from SSA Clotted Cream wouldn't come through, but it did, just enough to ruin it. I already have [another CAP Custard Cake recipe](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/260774#lemon_pound_cake_lpc_by_kenowhere) steeping, but now I'm still left wanting a great Tres Leches. I'll give [this one](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/280072#tres_leches_by_kylezkloudz) a mix. **TASK 1**

**Cucumber**

Update. Tastes like good ingredient, juicy and refreshing. I couldn't think of a recipe I needed it for, but I tried one that stood out and was not disappointed. [Punched Guava](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/226992) goes on the list of favorites. Awesome stuff, really hit the profile. It gave me a reason to keep CAP Cucumber and removed some lingering doubts I had about FLV Energy Drink. Although, if it ever comes down to choosing between this a pretty similar recipe, [Zenitsu](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/197324#zenitsu_by_wolfwheeler), Zenitsu is going to win, just a personal preference for Jarritos Guava over Monster Guava.

Looking for more potential reasons to keep CAP's Cuke, I found nothing that grabbed me, but I have an idea: Adding 0.5% CAP Cucumber to Zenitsu to see if I can make it even more juicy-feeling and refreshing than it already is, without messing it up. **TASK 2**

**Creamy Yogurt**

Update. I misplaced and could not relocate my bottle of TFA Key Lime Pie that I needed to try one recipe using Creamy Yogurt, but TFA Key Lime Pie sucks anyway and I didn't have super high hopes for the recipe. The other recipe I picked out that used CAP Creamy Yogurt, [Pina Papayaloupe](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/148934#pina_papayaloupe_aka_not_a_mango_by_brewdog_kilo) was very neat and I'll enjoy it down to the last drop, but I don't feel like it's something I just have to have a second time. Any one of a handful of good single-flavor mangoes would be just as enjoyable to me. Conclusion, I can do without CAP Creamy Yogurt in my life. **TRASH 1**

## FLAVORAH

**Donuts**

Extremely potent. Extra yeasty sweet dark brown bread. If you like the brown bread they bring you at Outback Steakhouse but just wish it had a lot more yeast in it, this might be the flavor for you. Speaking of the Outback, if you wanted to build a vegemite vape this might be a good starting place. It is not a donut. **TRASH 2**

**Dragon Fruit**

The only dragon fruit I've ever tried tasted very much like this, but I've heard that's because it was picked before it was fully ripe and transported and that I'd have a very different sense of dragon fruit tastes like if I got it fresh picked from an Asian market in Asia. Anyway, the dragonfruit I had tasted like a very light, somewhat floral pineapple, but it did not have a lot of flavor. Sweet, but not a ton of sweetness either.

FLV's take on it is quite floral and less white gummy bearish than others, but with some of that not-quite-pineapple base. The top note is very hibiscus-like, floral but not at all perfumy. But not the syrupy CAP hibiscus but more like unsweetened hibiscus tea, with a little bitterness to it. Very much like the slight floral note in a real USA supermarket dragon fruit. Oddly thin overall, yet saturated and sweet. Gives it a nearly beverage-type feel, if only it were a little wetter. Some noticeable throat something, but not the standalone harshness of some other dragon fruits. This is definitely the dragon fruit I would use for something like a dragonfruit tea, but that would need something juicier in the mix. I don't dislike it, but I'm not tempted by anything others have made out of it and don't feel like creating something with it, so... **TRASH 3**

**Eggnog**

Nowhere near eggy or rich enough to be a perfect rendition of eggnog, but a bit of heavy sweet cream with some richness and very slight egginess, with a solid dose of nutmeg and a light hint of cinnamon on top. So, lacking in a way that could be “fixed” if desired with a heavy custard (if using it literally as an eggnog and not some kind of thick warm spice accessory), but nothing at all off-tasting and nice spice that's forward without being overbearing. Tastes enough like eggnog that it seems to be begging for booze - rum, bourbon, whiskey, brandy - you name it.

I need it for this masterpiece: [BURLY BOIZ](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/69680#burly_boiz_by_matthewkocanda) - tobacco, vanilla, bourbon, banana? Yep. **TASK 3**

Been meaning to try this one for a long time: [Spiced Peaches & Cream](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/97742#spiced_peaches_and_cream_by_shyndo). **TASK 4** Here it is again [with 2% TFA Juicy Peach added](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/140879#spice_it_up_eggnog_peach_pie_cream_by_queeryourvape). I won't be mixing that, but I will definitely be thinking about what I could add to it to give it a little something special.

I love this [Nog Milk](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/79010#nog_milk_thechristmasmix_by_mlnikon) but it really, really wants me to add some booze. Gonna try 2% FA Jamaican Rum to start, might switch to (or add) VT Light Rum later. **TASK 5**

Also want to try:

[Spiced Eggnog Cookie Custard](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/252542#developed100_spiced_eggnog_cookie_custard_by_chasing84), but I think I'll cut that 0.6% CAP Super Sweet in half. **TASK 6**

And Daniel's [Pumpkin Pudding Remix](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/213178#pumpkin_pudding_remix_by_danielthevapeman). **TASK 7**

**Eisai Tea**

Is it just me or is FLV Eisai Tea the only green tea that doesn't have something very wrong with it? It's very clearly green tea, slightly earthy and musky in a way that green tea should be, full-bodied and while not as in your face as matcha green tea, tastes a bit like that. It has almost a creamy density and feel to it. It's not floral, or grassy, or anything like that, it pairs well with just about anything. It's basically everything I want in a green tea flavor, especially if I'm using it as something other than a beverage, because it does lack that sort of wet beverage feel to it.

I need it for my [GTKK 2019](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/136863#gtkk_2019_by_id10_t) and hopefully soon an improved version of that. In the meantime, I can hardly wait to try [Matcha Yoghurt Drink](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/162528#matcha_yoghurt_drink_by_kittybit), it looks ridiculously good. **TASK 8**

And this: [Mango Iced Tea](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/307829#mango_iced_tea_by_technokasper) that's hot off the presses - created less than a month ago. I'm a little concerned about 1% CAP Super Sweet, but... I mean... Mango Iced Tea. **TASK 9**

**Elderflower**

Complex and unique but rose-ish flavor, somewhat darker and more earthy and herbaceous than rose, less perfumey than rose, very similar to the rose-ish floral part of lychee, with a touch of citrus-like tartness, and an oddly but wonderfully creamy-feeling light and slightly fruity body. Nice depth here. Strange because I know it's a white flower, but it tastes almost purple. Slightly sweet, but with an oddly bitter finish that might be off-putting to some people. Doesn't taste alcoholic or quite like St-Germain, but similar.

I need it to make [Yoda Soda](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/158275#yoda_soda_by_staybert), and so do you, even if you don't know it yet. Such an awesome recipe. But I just added it to the to-mix list last week. I only wanted to find one other potential reason to keep it, but I think I might have found two:

[Elderberry](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/222206#elder_berry_by_ruderudi). Forest Fruit with Elderflower, Coconut, and Cream. **TASK 10**

And [Springtime](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/41479#springtime_by_kopel). A bouquet of florals with Pink Guava and Coconut. **TASK 11**

**Energy Drink**

Tastes like a whole pack of sweet tarts dissolved in battery acid, with a bubblegum back note. So pretty much spot-on energy drink. Definitely not green or blue Monster, and I get more of an original Rock Star (in the black can) or Red bull vibe from it. Very sugary sweet. Not harsh despite the battery acid, actually really smooth. Lots of depth here as well, not a thin or top heavy flavor. I want to try:

[Energized Mango](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/221042#energized_mango_by_kittybit). **TASK 12**

[Mango Blast](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/221292#mango_blast_by_wvance). **TASK 13**

[Caffeine Free](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/268721#caffeine_free_by_mixnjuice). That looks insane, mixing an energy drink flavor of all things with those ingredients (Cream, Whipped Cream, Vanilla Pudding). I can hardly wait to try it. **TASK 14**

**Fig**

Sweet, dark, musky, nearly fermented, nowhere near as bright and fruity as some other figs. Very deep and thick. Instead of bright fruitiness, there's a bit of “almost cinnamon but not quite spice” to the top notes. Kind of like a date. Not quite a raisin, but closer to that “raisiny” note that some tobaccos have than raisin. That's primarily what I'd use it for, to give tobaccos that special raisiny type of taste they have.

I need it for one of my absolute most favorite ever recipes, [Giant Swan](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/247312#giant_swan_by_concreteriver). **TASK 15**

And another old favorite that I recently added to my to-mix list [Wild Horses](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/131078#wild_horses_by_tamvapes). Since Wild Horses has me feeling like I can trust Tam with both FLV Fig and tobacco, I should probably mix up another FLV Fig and tobacco recipe Tam has created and shared. That's just common sense. [Ride with Me](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/141663#ride_with_me_by_tamvapes). **TASK 16**

Sebastien has a couple recipes with Fig and tobacco, too. I'll the one that looks best to me first, and if I like it, maybe the other one later: [Drunk Cardinal](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/283834#drunk_cardinal_by_sebastien) **TASK 17**

**Fire Cinnamon**

Seems to be FLV's answer to “just the top” cinnamon without the depth and fullness of their other cinnamons. Does have some body to it, but it's light, neutral, and fairly thin, also a little dry, with some lingering spicy cinnamon. Not a full-on candy but not a clear bakery spice, either, seems like it could be versatile and go either way depending on whether it's mixed with a sweet candy base or some bakery thing, but probably not the best choice for either. No off notes. Could also be the cinnamon in on top of a cocktail for, with booze and lots of added sweetness, something along the lines of Fireball Whiskey. Not bad, but I don't need it. What I need is to get rid of some flavors today. **TRASH 4**

**Fried Dough**

Extremely potent. Has a definite “fried” or at least greasy flavor but it's as aggressively yeasty as FLV Donut, just with grease instead of brown bread. The overall effect is just greasy yeast. It seems like oily yeast could be useful in building a donut, if used lower than 0.25% - might need to make a dilution – because 0.25% is so aggressively yeasty. But, by itself, it is not especially pleasant to vape. I haven't seen anything made out of it that doesn't look like it would be better if something else had been used in its place. **TRASH 5**

**Frosting**

Vanilla buttercream-type frosting or cake icing. Sweet and accurate frosting flavor. Accurate powdered sugar taste but creamier, not excessively dry, actually pretty smooth. Dense, fluffy. Great, fairly prominent, not too bright vanilla. Needs a steep to fill out, I also get some TH from it until it has steeped for a week. After it steeps, has some depth and richness to it, but not a custardy richess, just a bit of buttery-ness that is more a feeling than a taste.

Pretty much tastes like store-bought icing, but also reminds me of how little difference there is between a marshmallow and a frosting flavor, unless the frosting has a fair amount of dairy cream. FLV Frosting does taste more like frosting than marshmallow to me, but if you told me it was supposed to be a marshmallow, I wouldn't have any reason to disbelieve you.

I wouldn't even put this in my top 5 frosting flavors, but it's in at least a handful of things I already plan to mix.

I'm going to add [Puff'd Up](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/114490#puff_d_up_by_steamon) because it looks delightful. **TASK 18**

And [Deeznuts](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/232719#deeznuts_by_eyemsam) because it's kind of my fault this exists, and because I might steal it and use it as a base for something else later. **TASK 19**

**Ginger**

I love this. It tastes like ginger syrup with a tiny bit of pleasantly floral and citrusy complexity. It's not like sharp fresh ginger or spicier dry ginger spice, it's thick, sweet, and syrupy, like something you'd use to make homemade ginger ale - just add carbonated water. Doesn't seem very suited for bakeries at all, but seems perfect for ginger ale, ginger candies, and adding a ginger note to fruit mixes. Check out the Canada Dry website, great-looking ideas for cocktails on there. I want to make them all to drink and also vapeable versions of every last one of them. For those vapeable versions I would probably start with FLV Ginger.

I loved [Ardent](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/71551#ardent_by_loonicorn) before I was no longer able to enjoy TFA VBIC, so once I nail down a Longing remix, I'll definitely be trying it again with the addition of FLV Ginger.

In the meantime, I'll just have another glass of Kopel's [Ginger Beer](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/62195#ginger_beer_by_kopel). **TASK 20**

**Ginger Peach**

Why? Why is this needed? If we wanted a ginger peach, couldn't we just add ginger to a peach flavor? That's weird right? But the weirdest thing is, it mostly tastes like cream soda. More than half of this vape is clearly cream soda flavor, with just enough vanilla for a cream soda, then just a hint of white peach, with little kick of ginger spice on top. Ginger is mostly in the top and in the finish. Full bodied, not thin at all, almost a marshmallow like thickness to it. Smooth and mellow, not harsh at all, which is interesting for peach and ginger, but overall just odd. I like the taste of it, it's pleasant, but what the hell, man? I'd like to the hear the story behind this one, like was it a failed attempt at cream soda or ginger ale, and they just decided to call it ginger peach, or what is the deal?

[Gringo](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/119328#gringo_by_sheckjuarez) is a strange little recipe that's already on my list. [Beach Vibes](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/189314#beach_vibes_by_novitec) can join it there, but I'm going to chop that CAP Super Sweet % in half. **TASK 21**

**Ginger Snap**

**TRASH 6** Some coil-gunking flavors are worth the gunk, to me, this one just isn't. The concentrate itself is thick as hell and if you let it sit for long it starts to have sediment settle in it, and it's hard to shake back into the solution. I'll accept that from some of the finest tobaccos, but not from a gingersnap. Just a small sample of it ruined by cotton fairly quick and left some gunk on the coils too.

But if you ignore that, leads with dark molasses and some soft sweet cookie notes, and just a touch of ginger bakery spice. Pretty much hits the profile, though it's missing a little texturally, doesn't quite have the “snap” you'd expect from gingersnaps, it's more like the soft center of a fresh homemade gingersnap rather than one of the crunchy cookies from a bag off the grocery store shelf.

**Graham Cracker**

Tastes fairly authentic, but thin and even a little harsh by itself, needs to be mixed with thick, smooth, creamy things, I think. It's all like graham cracker top notes without a base. Very dry, but that's accurate to the profile of a graham cracker. Not as sweet as its counterparts, not as dark either, kind of reminds me of a blonde graham cracker or those Nekot graham-craker-esque cookies.

Have tried it in some recipes where it worked very well, the one that sticks out most in my mind is Jennifer Jarvis' [Morning Wood](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/63258#morning_wood_by_jenniferjarvis), but I can probably live without that one again. Until I went looking, I had forgotten it was in [Dismal Pie](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/182070#dismal_pie_by_dragonlady) but now I want to try that one again. **TASK 22**

It's also in several things I already plan to mix, such as the Tobacco Mint Meltaway that I'm excited about.

**Granny Smith**

Crisp and sweet mostly natural green apple, with slight grassy nail polish remover all around it, and also a little candied. Really similar to their Green Apple, but more natural and with worse off notes and more TH. Sharp up front, where that acetone note lies, then some crisp green apple peel and a sweet body, but that acetone bit comes back in the finish and lingers. Also there's some TH, it's a little rough. Also a bit dry for a green apple, I want some juice here. I would not use this again at 2%. I don't want to use it at all without a lot of help, I'd use it more as an additive for that crisp tart peel bite in the middle in the half a percent or less range with other apples or pears if I wanted to find an easy use for it. But that's just me, and I have tried it in a recipe, one of my favorites actually, at 1.5% and didn't find the recipe to be harsh or have any chemical off notes: [Pheasant Ridge](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/64553#pheasant_ridge_by_fear). I couldn't find any other recipes I wanted to mix that use it, so I guess I'll just mix some more Pheasant Ridge. I might be letting Pheasant Ridge go soon, I think that's now two ingredients in it that don't have another use for. **TASK 23**

**Granola**

Concrete called it “homemade hippie-grade granola” and that pretty much sums it up, but after trying this again and re-reading his review I have to say I have a somewhat different impression of it. It's definitely a darker granola top note - but Rick called out “some light fruitiness” and he went on to describes as an “almond/cherry note” but the fruit sticks out a bit more to me and tastes more raisiny than cherry, with some very light generic nuttiness behind it. It does have a toasted or maybe roasted oat flavor as the main note though. The sweetness level is fairly low and the sweetness is very dark, like dark karo syrup dark. It doesn't taste like honey, it's like brown sugar syrup or something.

Although it tastes like granola, it's lacking the main thing you probably want in a granola vape unless you're after a chewy granola bar thing; it's got no crunch to it. It's odd to have something that tastes overcooked like it should also be overly crunchy, but isn't crunchy at all.

It's also a very potent flavor. I'm not getting anything too out of whack at 0.5% other than a too-dark roast on oats with raisins, faint nuttiness, and no crunch, but at 1% it's coming across a bit burned and bitter in the way that burnt food is bitter. If you want to use this as part of a granola layer with yogurt or creams, I feel like it will give you the oat-y flavor between 0.25 and 0.5%, but you're still going to add some nut to it maybe some additional crunch from something like a graham cracker, cookie, or cereal flavor or just straight up AP. I'd steer away from FA Cookie since this is already too dark but something like Cereal 27 or JF Biscuit could work with some FA Almond.

I need it for [Shiro](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/207414#shiro_by_wolfwheeler) - a terrific oatmeal cream pie vape, but I think that recipe might still be awesome without it, so I'm going mix it both ways and see. **TASK 24** and **TASK 25**

**Grape**

Purple. Reasonably assertive, at least for a grape, not as “meh” as most other grapes. Tastes very much like a fresh piece of grape bubblegum. Has some tartness and a significantly more oomph to it than some of the other blatantly artificial purple flavors. Syrupy sweet base and a fuller mouthfeel than most of the other grapes, not quite as full as the grape gum that it tastes like, but full. Other than the fact that it's clearly an artificial grape flavor and contains nothing resembling anything found in nature, I don't get any off notes from this.

I don't have anything I feel like I have to have it for, but there are multiple recipes I already plan to try that use it. The one I'm gonna add to that isn't even a grape recipe, it's a [Blue Raz Slushie](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/269447#fairy_dust_blue_raz_slushie_mwc_best_recipe_by_diyejuices). **TASK 26**

**Greek Yogurt**

Thick like a Lane Bryant model thick, great for texture, even just 0.1% does good for thickening up things, gives a smoother, thicker texture. A very dense, hearty base. But a few mls of it at 1% makes me start to feel sick after a bit. There's not a ton of tartness but what's there is a bit barfy, like slightly spoiled milk. A little sweet. No vanilla or other off notes.

[Cherry Hills](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/84100#cherry_hills_ejm_x_chef_s_one_shot_by_concreteriver) with its 0.25% FLV Greek Yogurt in a starburst recipe is already on my list of things to try. Adding the one Rick stole that trick from, [Appermelon Gummies](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/67603#appermelon_gummies_candy_by_steamon). **TASK 27**

**Green Apple**

Mostly natural green apple up front, but leans a bit candy overall, sort of like two flavors in one, natural and candy. Not quite nail polish remover but grassy and a bit astringent or bitter - lots of sharp peel here upfront. Some juiciness with a sweet and thick base that goes candish and flat - quite a bit of separation between the green apple skin and green apple candy. As much TH as a very tart flavor but not really that tart, just feels acidic. Seems like a small amount of it might turn a fuji apple into more of a green - not sure about using it as the main or only green apple flavor. Not a bad flavor, just has an identity issue where it seems too natural for candy and too candy for natural by itself. No one has done anything with it that I want to try, so **TRASH 7**

**Green Tea**

Ok, that one mostly tastes like green tea, but why is it so minty? Green tea with mint is a thing and it would definitely need a little more mint to nail that, but it should still be labeled as such because it's minty enough to be useless as a straight-up green tea. Doesn't have a distinctive mint flavor, tastes just a little minty, and has a very slight cooling sensation. Also a little grassy, but nothing like TFA Green Tea-level lawn clippings.

I'll try [mlNikon's Fabulous Asian Dude Mix](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/124774#mlnikon_s_fabulous_asian_dude_mix_by_mixinvixens) **TASK 28**

And this [Divinitea](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/190280#divinitea_by_sebastien) for the tropicals **TASK 29**

Saw a couple more I might add later if either of those make FLV Green Tea keeper.

**Guanabana**

I get a nice balance of fruit notes that are mostly pineapple and banana, along with some strawberry or kiwi and coconut. Tart top notes like a blend of pineapple and something else, maybe strawberry or kiwi, with a thick, sweet creamy thick base similar to a combination of coconut cream and banana but not really tasting exactly like either, with the slightest bit of tropical funkiness in there. ConcreteRiver has said the overall effect is like a tart, ripe banana, and that's about what I get from it. Which is weird, as a ripe banana would be anything but tart, but also kinda wonderful. There is a little something green in that pineapple/strawberry top, like under-ripe banana or strawberry stems, a bit of a bitter, rindy type flavor, that lingers a bit, that might get weird with some things, like bakeries and really eggy custards, but seems like it goes well with anything that accents what's already there.

I love what some people have already done with this flavor and want to try more things.

Favorites to mix again:

[Green Bastard](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/153649#green_bastard_by_yippyo). **TASK 30** Stop reading this and go mix this if you haven't already.

[Green Bastard Strap-On](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/197773#green_bastard_strap_on_by_rogueislander). Super fun recipe mashup. **TASK 31**

[Trop Cock](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/35505#trop_cock_strap_on_by_deejay_mills). One of the recipes that's mashed up in the Green Bastard Strap-On. **TASK 32**

[Kawayan](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/53071#kawayan_by_runtdastardly). I've mixed several bottles of this but never tried the creator's own suggestion of adding a bit of WS-23 to it, I'll do that at 0.5% now. **TASK 33**

[All Day](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/78350#all_day_by_maxsavage). A recipe that pairs well with adulting. It's hard, but this makes it a little easier. **TASK
34**

[Mango Beauregard](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/39457#mango_beauregarde_by_kopel). Just lovely. Mango, but purple. **TASK 35**

New things to try:

I threw a handful of whims together on a benefit live stream with the only guidance being “something tropical” using only flavors in Daniel's arsenal and came up with [Daniel's Vacation](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/229250#daniel_s_vacation_by_id10_t). I meant to go back and develop it into a real recipe, but I don't have to, Daniel did it for me: [My Vacation V2](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/229602). **TASK 36**

Speaking of Daniel, his review convinced me to try this [Jack My Guanabana Guava](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/233596#jack_my_guanabana_guava_by_kuri_santou). **TASK 37**

Still on the subject of Danel, [Safari Zone](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/161307) looks great but Daniel's [Safari Zone Remix](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/161307) looks even better, I'll skip the OG and just mix the remix. **TASK 38**

[Draconian Tropics](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/199962#draconian_tropics_by_foment_life). Looks really interesting for just three ingredients, probably because two of the three are so complex on their own. **TASK 39**

**Hazelnut**

**TRASH 8** This is either a beyond super-concentrated flavor that requires dilution or it is an absolute dumpster fire. There's a hazelnut in there somewhere but even at one-quarter of a percent, it also tastes like GASOLINE. WTF, Flavorah?

I gave this another chance at 0.13% and was considerably more vapeable, but still not right. The gasoline disappeared or at least calmed down into something like a green unripe nut skin kind of thing, astringent and weird. The hazelnut is quite recognizable but that off-note on top is off-putting. The base was sweeter than I recalled it being at 0.25% and it had a thick, creamy feel, but it's at best a raw hazelnut with that nut skin flavor, and it would be difficult to work with if half of a quarter of a percent is the difference between raw hazelnut and raw hazelnut dipped in 87 octane.

**Heat**

It's more of a feeling than a flavor, like the opposite of WS-23, just a tasteless hot sensation like the feeling you have after eating hot peppers, without the actual hot pepper flavor. It's surprisingly not “harsh” to vape in the usual sense of the word, it's just spicy. It's more in the finish of the vape than up front. It lingers in your mouth and will make your lips tingle. Mixing it with sweetener really increases that effect.

I need it for my Spicy Icy Chamoyada Mangonada. And at least two or three other things already on the to-try list.I also want some more of [The Politician](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/63533#the_politician_by_chemicalburnvictim). **TASK 40**

And I'll mix [Old Man Cobb](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/286197#old_man_cobb_by_spdrjrslm) because Wolfwheeler said I'm a baby if I don't. **TASK 41**

**Hibiscus**

Nothing at all like sweet, syrupy CAP Hibiscus. This thing is FLORAL. Lighter and brighter than rose and not perfumy, just very in your face fresh flowers flavor. There's even a little bit of green stem and leaves in there. Also very dry. I can do without all that. **TRASH 9**

**Honey Bee**

Speaking of floral. FLV Honey Bee is super potent super floral honey. It's sweet like honey but also very floral. Room note is more honey-like than the actual vape, which just punches you in the face with flowers before getting to the darker sweetness underneath. As far as which flower, it kinda tastes honey-suckle-ish, but not exactly honeysuckle. No gross pee notes and I actually enjoyed this flavor, but I feel like the flowery business will limit this. Vapes smooth, feels thick. When diluted to about 0.13%, it loses a little more of the floralness than it loses honey sweetness, so I'm thinking less than a quarter percent is going to be a good starting place for this, but it's still not going to be very versatile. I'm going to toss it in favor of less floral, more versatile honey flavors. **TRASH 10**

**Honeydew**

If I've ever single-flavor tested this, I don't remember doing it and can't find any record of it. I will try a 2% sample. **TASK 42**

I did mix a recipe that used it once. It was not something I would ever mix again, but I don't think that was FLV Honeydew's fault.

**Horchata**

Eating powdered Horchata mix without adding water first? It's not actually so dry as a powder, but it's pretty dry for something that's supposed to be a beverage. The rice water flavor and cinnamon are both present and realistic, as well as well-balanced. The cinnamon up front tastes like dilution-level amount of FLV Rich Cinnamon, like the cinnamon note in FLV Apple Filling and FLV Cinnamon Crunch, but with rice water instead of apple or cereal. Deeper, thick body with some voluminous cream like a little milk added, maybe almond milk because there's some nuttiness poking out behind everything else, but not much. Cinnamon type/level dead on for horchata, along with a nice light sweetness. It is a bit harsh for me for the amount of cinnamon I get out of it. And despite the cream flavor, again, quite a bit dry on the end for something that's supposed to be a beverage. Besides using it as a horchata, I could see it working in a cinnamon cereal and milk type of situation and with the rice taste being fairly subtle, maybe any kind of bakery for slightly starchy volume with a bit of cinnamon.

It's used in [something I already plan to mix](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/278386#1312_acab_by_wolfwheeler) and I want to try this [Chalet](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/287374#chalet_by_t_a_r_a_x) recipe as well. **TASK 43**

When I tried it for the first time, I wanted to see what happens if I mix it with one of the more realistic plain graham cracker flavors and see if I get a cinnamon graham cracker like CAP Graham Cracker but with a better, richer bakery cinnamon. So I'll give that a go now.

Cinna Graham Experiment, V1 **TASK 44**

| Flavor | Co.            | %   |
| ------ | -------------- | --- |
| FLV    | Horchata       | 1   |
| FW     | Graham Cracker | 3   |
| VT     | Honeycomb      | 1   |

_Graham Cracker and Horchata looked lonely and my gut told me VT Honeycomb would be a tasty edition. Call it an attempt at a “gourmet” cinnamon graham cracker. If you've got a better idea for something different to mix with FW Graham Cracker and FLV Horchata to make it more interesting and tasty without throwing it too far off the profile of “just a cinnamon graham cracker” I would love to hear it and will very likely mix it instead of, or alongside, this one._

**Ice**

I don't know how much of this you have to add to something to make anything cold but it's considerably weaker than WS-23 (30%) or FA Polar Blast and yet has a little bitter taste like Koolada, and as such, I wouldn't use it to build anything. If it wasn't already in [a recipe I'm already planning to try](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/214950#black_lemonade_by_nickevz), I'd toss it. But since it is, I'll give it one more **TASK 45**: [Pink Gin](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/153662#pink_gin_all_flavorah_by_tamvapes). Gin with grapefruit juice and lemonade, with strawberry and lime accents.

**Irish Cream**

Really tasty, in fact I love this even just as a single flavor, but that is not Irish Cream.

This is as much a coffee flavor as anything else. I get that putting it in coffee is by far the most common use for Irish Cream, but I'd kinda like to make that decision myself rather than having Flavorah make it for me. It tastes great, though. Tastes like you dumped both Irish Cream-flavored coffee creamer and chocolate milk in coffee and then topped that with marshmallows. The Irish Cream part is sweet and tastes like a cross between Irish cream and marshmallow; it tastes like Irish Cream but is fluffy like a marshmallow rather than creamy, right on top. A dark roasted and only slightly burned, and very slightly nutty, coffee flavor sits in there, just below that, and gradually gets more chocolatey, and it's a chocolate that shifts from mocha coffee to tasting much more like milk chocolate though the exhale, and lots of chocolate milk, at that. So you put all that together and it's weird, and very complex for a single flavor, but tasty. Would use this in something like a coffee ice cream or maybe even a hot cocoa vape, but would not recommend trying to use it as Irish Cream without coffee at all. Also taking it off profile for Irish Cream, it has no booze notes.

I like the the look of this mint latte that uses just a little of the FLV Irish Cream for the coffee note: [mlNikon's Mint Latte](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/128741#mlnikon_s_mint_latte_by_mixinvixens). **TASK 46**

I wish there were more recipes using FLV Irish Cream so fuck it, I'll try to make my own, too.

Cappuccino Chocolate Chunk Ice Cream, V1 **TASK 47**

| Co. | Flavor            | %    |
| --- | ----------------- | ---- |
| FLV | Irish Cream       | 1.25 |
| SSA | Ice Cream Vanilla | 2.5  |
| WF  | Chocolate Chunks  | 1    |
| CAP | Super Sweet       | 0.25 |
| FA  | Almond            | 0.5  |

Don't ask me why the little touch of FA Almond, I can't explain it, but my instinct is telling me that is what's gonna tie it all together.

I've hit the character limit so hard that Part 31, which will be up in a minute, will be just as long as this one.
