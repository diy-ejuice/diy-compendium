TASK OR TRASH - Each flavor gets assigned at least one task or it goes in the trash.

# INAWERA

**Honey**

Bright floral honey, not perfumy, sticky sweet, but enough cat piss off note to be pretty gnarly, and not just in the room note, but all up in my sinus cavity when vaping. Someone told me this would steep out, but at almost two weeks, it was still going strong in a 0.25% sample. **TRASH 1**

**Irish Coffee**

So, it's supposed to be coffee with a bit of whiskey it, but these bizarrely tastes more like butter in some kind of weird nonalcoholic whiskey flavoring, like a bizarro world butter rum. I can't find any coffee in there, there's a little bitter edge to it that is maybe supposed to be coffee? But plenty of butter. It isn't super rich or thick but it mostly tastes like butter. There's some whiskey-ish taste but it's overly sweet and has no boozy bite to it. It's just a mess. But, it's not a huge surprise because INW Whisky also has this weird funky slightly rancid buttery off note. This has the same thing, but it's more intense. **TRASH 2**

**Kiwi**

Not very accurate for kiwi but seems like it might be a fun little flavor to play with. It's candy sweet and sort of kiwi-ish, with some tartness attached to a little green apple grassy thing, and a deep melony, banana-ish mildly funky base. It kinda tastes like a “tart, ripe banana,” which makes no actual sense, and is also exactly the same way ConcreteRiver described FLV Guanabana. It really has a lot in common with the guanabana and cherimoya type flavors, especially INW Cherimoya, which has this same kind of “sweaty” funkiness. But not exactly because those tend to taste like combinations of apple, pineapple, strawberry, banana, and coconut and this is more green apple, banana, and cantaloupe/honeydew type melon.

Already planned to mix Daniel's Venusaur that uses it. No surprise to find an abstract Daniel recipe that uses it, since it has so much in common with custard apple flavors. I'll also try his [Pits of The Sea](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/225653-pits_of_the_sea). **TASK 1**

**Lemon**

Inawera reformulated this, and is often the case, reformulated seems to be another word for “ruined.” Now it's weaker and thinner and tastes like half old INW Lemon and half Pledge-flavored pixie sticks. I don't know for sure what I'm going to do with my old recipes that rely on it, but using this is not it. **TRASH 3**

**Lemon Cake**

Far from perfect, it has been described as “accurate lemon cake that has been burnt and dried out.” Personal opinion, though that description isn't far off, it's probably worth picking up just for the various recipes that have been created to correct its deficiencies. They mostly involve reinforcing the bakery with non-burnt bakeries and adding more butter and lemon. All of those things are already in there: a sweet lemon that tastes baked-in, a heavy cake that does taste a little dry has some slight bitterness like the crusty edges of an overcooked cake, and some buttery richness. It's sugary sweet and thick and tastes realistic.

Keeping this to try two recipes:

[LBC](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/lemon_butter_cookie_71724), a lemon butter cookie recipe **TASK 2**

And [Android 18](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/276202-android_18), a lemon meringue pie that looks great to me. It might not be, though. Lemon + Bakery, in my experience, is easy to make decent but hard to make great. It's always such a balancing act. **TASK 3**

**Lemon Mix**

Apparently this has been discontinued? If true, that is a tragedy. Maybe the second worst thing that could happen to lemon-flavored DIY juice, behind FE Lemon being discontinued (knocks on wood). It is a very zesty lemon - pretty much a lemon zest flavor, has some bitterness but not a weird chemically bitterness, just like some of the white pith in a lemon. Very fresh tasting. Light, no body. Definitely tops out at 1% would suggest starting at 0.25% - very strong - gets weird and overly bitter/chemical above that. Perfect for adding just a twist of lemon to a cocktail vape or making a candyish lemon taste more like an actual lemon.

I'll mix my own recipe, [Creamsquat](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/208695-creamsquat__) to think about how I might remix it in a way that doesn't need Lemon Mix. **TASK 4**

And while/if I've still got some left, try some terrific looking recipes -
[Chrysalis](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/129395-chrysalis), a cool lime and hops mix. **TASK 5**

[Emma Watson](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/173912-emma_watson), citrus and honeysuckle. **TASK 6**

And [Razzle Burst](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/175328-razzle_burst) a berry taffy-like candy that uses an intriguing combination of FLV Boysenberry and FW Razzleberry. **TASK 7**

**Lemons Kick**

Someone told me this was straight-up 7-UP, like CAP Lemon Lime except fizzy. So I felt a little misled when I tried it.

INW Lemons Kick is for-real, no joke fizzy, like I get the full tingle of a carbonated soft drink, but also very odd. It tastes like 50% 7-up and 50% vanilla cream soda, with some extra lemon. Fizzy and lemony up front, with a touch of lime behind that, and a sweet, creamy base with prominent vanilla flavor to it. It's very pleasant, but that's strange. Someone on ELR described it as a “7-up flavored starburst” and with the thick, creamy base here, that makes sense to me, except that it's legit fizzy. More like a 7-up float made with vanilla ice cream. Weird stuff, but could be fun to play with.

I don't think it will work, but I'll experiment with using 2% INW Lemons Kick instead of 0.25% INW Lemon Mix to recreate Creamsquat. **TASK 8**

**Lime**

Not to be confused with Shisha Lime. Quite potent. Pretty much a perfect lime 1%. It's bright and sweet, it's got some zestiness to it that's not overdone, it is not harsh at all. It's actually smooth. It's a very nice balance of tart and sweet, if a little less realistic than some others like FA Cold Pressed. Would work for real lime with fruit, candy lime, just about any kind of lime. Lime bakery. Lime Cream. You name it. Some other limes might work better for specific applications but this one is a lime-of-all-trades. Does fade a bit, but not terribly or completely. There was a rumor that it had been reformulated but I think what actually happened was some people wound up with a bad, old, mishandled, or mislabeled batch. Correct me if I'm definitely wrong on this, please.

I need it to mix [The Colada Affair](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/46527-the_colada_affair) - a favorite of mine. But I'm going to try that with the newer CAP Fresh Pineapple in place of the CAP Golden Pineapple **TASK 9**

Also want to try [Tranquil](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/80332-tranquil), a pear-honeysuckle recipe (love that combo). **TASK 10**

**Mango**

Perfumey, floral, dry, green, underripe. Very potent. I know people have had some success using it in lower amounts to brighten other mangoes or make them taste more realistic, but there are better things for that and by itself this is disgusting. **TRASH 4**

**Mango and Tango**

The one good mango from INW, but's not realistic or just straight mango. It tastes like eating a mango-flavored Lifesaver candy and a pineapple-flavored Lifesaver's Creamsaver candy at the same time. Very full flavored and has an almost rich, creamy-ish body. I could see it working wonders in all kinds of tropical candy mixes.

I looked at all the current recipes that use it and some of them were tempting but none were irresistible. So for now I just want to do a little experiment:

M&T Candy Experiment V1 **TASK 11**

| Co. | Flavor          | %   |
| --- | --------------- | --- |
| INW | Mango & Tango   | 3   |
| WF  | Sour Ball Candy | 2.5 |
| CAP | Sweet Tangerine | 1   |
| PUR | Passion Fruit   | 2   |

That should come out tasting like eating a Mango Tangelo and a Pineapple Passionfruit Tropical Skittle at the same time. Of course to do the whole bag would also need banana, kiwi, strawberry, and lime flavors (might get away with just one of the guanabana/cherimoya flavors and some time), but it's a starting place.

**Marzipan**

It mostly tastes like cherry to me. Lots of sweet candy cherry with strong amaretto accent, very dense and thick, very sweet, great for filling out cherry flavors because it is basically a cherry that has an amaretto off note instead of cherry that has a new vinyl shower curtain off note.

It's used in several things I've already planned to mix or mix again, including Vurve's Vanilla Almond Milk which is one of my most favorite recipes of all time, and another favorite, 1-2-3 Coco Sang.

I like the profile idea of this [Cherry Vanilla Tobacco](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/115993-cherry_vanilla_tobacco) recipe but don't want all that Tatanka. I'm afraid it will taste like cherry vanilla chewing tobacco. I'm going to steal from it to try a cherry-vanilla cigar type tobacco instead.

Cherry Vanilla Cigar V1 **TASK 12**

| Co. | Flavor           | %    |
| --- | ---------------- | ---- |
| INW | Marzipan         | 1.5  |
| TFA | Cherry Extract   | 3    |
| INW | Shisha Vanilla   | 1    |
| INW | Vanilla For Pipe | 1.5  |
| FLV | Cured Tobacco    | 2    |
| FLV | Red Burley       | 0.75 |

**Melon**

This has been reformulated. I got a new bottle of the new version when I ran out of the old stuff but still haven't opened it. Will mix a 1.5% sample. **TASK 13**

**Milk Chocolate & Strawberry**

It's like eating chocolate-covered strawberry fruit snacks out of a condom. Which, if that's something you're into, I'm not here to judge. But this thing has a rubbery taste to it that's not just generically rubbery, but specifically like latex. The chocolate itself is a little dry, too, despite clearly being a milk chocolate flavor, like some of the cocoa powder wasn't mixed in well enough. The strawberry is pretty middle of the road but leaning a little candy, like one of those strawberry fruit snacks that have real strawberry in there but also corn syrup and artificial flavors. **TRASH 5**

**Miss Cream**

INW uses a picture that looks like vanilla ice cream cone. Description is “Creamy custard taste with a delicate hint of fudge and vanilla.” I wouldn't call that vanilla delicate exactly and I failed to find any fudge, not even a smidge of something dark that resembles fudge or chocolate in any way. Also, nothing custardy about it. INW Miss Cream has a super bright, artificial-tasting nearly floral vanilla, but only a moderate amount of it, on top of a heavily dairy-flavored cream. Somewhat fluffy or airy mouthfeel, kinda like a cheap ice cream, but more like canned whipped cream. Not a bad flavor outside of not really tasting like it's supposed to.

[Layerz Dream Cream](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/145165-layerz_dreamcream) looks like what it says it is, a cream layer that's thick and sweet and can work well with most flavors. I'm going to see what happens when I add 2% INW Kiwi to it. **TASK 14**
