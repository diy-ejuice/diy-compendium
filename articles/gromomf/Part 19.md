## Capella

**Butter Cream**

Update. I tried a recipe that used CAP Butter Cream. I screwed up and put CAP Vanilla Cupcake in it because I couldn't find my CAP Vanilla Cupcake V2 (it has since been located, right were it was supposed to be, I should really see an eye doctor. Anyway, [Great Scotch!](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/25210) tastes remarkably like one of those Tastycake Butterscotch Kirmpets, even with the substitution. So if you love those things and want to vape them, I recommend it. I've tried a different Butterscotch Krimpet recipe before and it was tasty, but not nearly as accurate as this one. But, even with the correct CAP Vanilla Cupcake version, I don't see it being a desert island vape for me.

I can't ditch CAP Butter Cream because it's any too many of the recipes already on my to-mix list, so I'll just add some more instead.

[Banana Cream Crepe](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/97156#banana_cream_crepe_by_lukeloop) by the creator of Yellow Matter Custard. **TASK 1**

And this really interesting-looking absolute mess of flavors [Arcade Cinnamix](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/283113#arcade_cinnamix_by_suck_her_toes). **TASK 2**

In other CAP Butter Cream news, my first attempt to remake my old Apple Butter Doodle Cookie without using it was very messed up. Way too much apple, and it's kinda boozy. Instead of tasting like a snickerdoodle with apple butter in the dough, it tastes like a sugar cookie dipped in cinnamon-spiced & liquor-spiked apple cider. Time to try again. What I had done was 1.25% CAP Cinnamon Sugar, 5% CAP Sugar Cookie, 1% FA Custard Premium, 0.25% Liquid Amber, 1.25% FLV Apple Filling, 0.5% FLV Caramel, 1.5% VT Pudding Base 1.5% WF Apple Butter, 2% WF Cookie Butter. That's a mess. You guys should not have let me do that.

New ABDC V2 **TASK 3**

| Co. | Flavor         | %    |
| --- | -------------- | ---- |
| CAP | Cinnamon Sugar | 1.25 |
| FLV | Rich Cinnamon  | 0.10 |
| CAP | Sugar Cookie   | 4    |
| JF  | Cookie         | 1    |
| WF  | Cookie Butter  | 1.25 |
| WF  | Apple Butter   | 1.25 |
| FLV | Caramel        | 0.75 |

I'm dropping the Apple Filling to reduce the overall apple, but adding Rich Cinnamon to make up for the lost cinnamon. The Sugar Cookie isn't holding up well to all the rest of the stuff so I'm trying to back it up with some JF Cookie. I love Pudding Base but it softens cookies and CAP is soft enough here by itself, so I'm pulling that out. I had multiple sources of butter in Custard Premium and WF Cookie Butter which is most likely unnecessary, so I'm pulling out the Custard and just going with Cookie Butter, and less of it. Liquid Amber is almost certainly the main source of the booze so goodbye to that. WF Apple Butter isn't quite apple butter on its own, it needs to be darkened. Without the Liquid Amber in there, I'm going to probably need a little more FLV Caramel to help with that, so I'm bumping that up a little.

**Cake Batter**

Update. I tried [Strawberry Marshmallow Dip](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/199611) rather than trashing CAP Cake Batter. Of course that tastes good, how could it not, just look at the ingredients. But I need a little more strawberry flavor intensity. I get the biscuit dipped in strawberry-marshmallow cream, but the strawberry is softened or washed out just a little too much by the other ingredients. Or possibly I'm slowly becoming a strawberry non-taster? I think ditching the FA Vienna Cream and using a bolder strawberry than Red Touch to augment that wonderful OoO Strawberry Jam would make this over-the-top good.

As it is, I would not use this as a reason to keep Cake Batter. But I'll try just one more thing before giving up on it: [CV Moist Supreme](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/243460#cv_moist_supreme_by_chainvapor). **TASK 4**

**Cantaloupe**

Update. [Zenitsu](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/197324). Not spot-on Jarritos Guava, but definitely tastes close enough to me to satisfy a Jarritos Guava craving, without all the sugar. Sweet, juicy, bright, refreshing, funky, and even a little (kinda) fizzy. I love this and will be keeping CAP Cantaloupe just to make more of it.

Now I just need someone to make my favorite Jarritos, the tamarind one, into a vape.

This is totally off topic, but while I was enjoying it, I started thinking, what if this had a little more dark funky fruit to it? It would take it off profile probably but I bet it would be so good. Then I realized what I really wanted to do was try something I've never tried before, guava + fig.

1-2-3 Experiment 626 V1 **TASK 5**

| Co. | Flavor      | %   |
| --- | ----------- | --- |
| FLV | Pink Guava  | 1   |
| VT  | Red Dates   | 2   |
| CAP | Sweet Guava | 3   |

Where were we? Oh, CAP Cantaloupe. Now that I'm keeping it for more Zenitsu, I want to look for other reasons to hang on to it.

Starting with another by the maker of Zenitsu: [Trunks](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/197792#trunks_by_wolfwheeler) **TASK 6**

And a couple others that looked especially tasty to me:

[Melon Milk](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/198664#melon_sa_malamig_melon_milk_by_bubbasbrewz). **TASK 7**

[Malonee](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/283658#malonee_mwc_pool_party_by_buriedalive) **TASK 8**

## Flavor West

**C. Crunch Berries**

AKA Crunchy Berry Cereal, AKA Crunchy Cereal with Berries, AKA whatever they're calling it now, it keeps changing names. 5% - Smells just like Capn Crunch Berries in the bottle. Mostly tastes like it, too, just a bit off in an earthy way. They got the berry right for sure, that prominent, sweet, fake blueberry/strawberry combo that tastes like Capn Crunch Berries. The corny cereal base is almost there, but it is a little dirty or earthy, like actual soil is in there. It's not strong though, and seems like it could be covered up with another cereal flavor, like CAP Cereal 27, or maybe even with a milk or cream flavor that you'd probably want to use with it anyway. It could be made to work. Here's the thing, there are some recipes that use this that look like they might be pretty good, but I'm just not that into Captn Crunch Berries to care. Never been my favorite cereal, not even close. So even though it's much better than the TFA version, I'm just going to **TRASH 1**

**Cafe Coffee**

Coffee Candy with a hint of caramel. Not quite Bali's Best coffee candy, because of the hint of caramel in the finish, but nowhere near as much caramel as a Wherther's Coffee Caramel hard candy. The actual coffee flavor tastes like artificial coffee flavoring and the sweetness and even the mouthfeel is very candylike. So for actual coffee, this is a no, but for a coffee candy with a hint of caramel, yes, nothing weird or off there. I kind of want to add some of it to toffee for a coffee toffee. Worth noting his flavor is black as night and hell on coils. I [made a recipe with this](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/92920#1_2_3_caramel_coffee_candy_by_id10_t), but the purpose of that was to give people who might already have it something tasty to do with it. Definitely was not to make anyone think they should buy it. I'm throwing it away because it's not worth the gunky coil carnage. **TRASH 2**

**Cake Batter Dip**

Cake batter dip is a real thing, and it's just Cool Whip, Vanilla Cake Mix, Cream Cheese, and Milk. Usually sprinkles are added too. It tastes pretty much like cake batter mixed with cake icing, and it's awesome. And FW pretty much nailed it, you can pick up all of those components except milk, but that's just there to make the real thing wet and mix it together. It's very sweet, with a bright vanilla flavor very much like vanilla cake mix has. Unfortunately, it's one of those flavors with sugar in it, and it's up to you whether you want to risk that health-wise, and it will destroy your cotton and gunk up your coils pretty severely. Aside from that, it's smooth and kind of creamy, not super heavy, not eggy or oily, it's whipped and fluffy almost to the point of being a marshmallow type of flavor, like a cake batter-flavored marshmallow. You could use it to make a cake batter, add some cooked bakery to it to make a cake, put it in a cake donut to grab some of that fluffy sweet. It's extremely versatile and will work in all kinds of bakery applications at a low %, but it's pretty full flavored at 3%. Just for fun I tried it at 7% and it was intense, and a bit more cake like - like a light fluffy vanilla cake complete with frosting, and not as fluffy, but not bad, but RIP my cotton after that. I know I should toss it over the sugar, but the best I can do is maybe not replace it once it's gone.

At the moment, I need it for my own recipe, [Lucky's Charms](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/99041#lucky_s_charms_by_id10_t), but I've hypothesized that PUR Simply Cake could replace the Cake Batter Dip in there, so I'm going to start tinkering with that using 2% PUR Simply Cake in place of the Cake Batter Dip, and see if any other adjustments are needed. **TASK 9**

But I also want to try [Goo In my Butter Cake](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/119884#goo_in_my_butter_cake_by_tamvapes). **TASK 10**

**Candy Cane**

It is about as average as a peppermint flavor can be. It's just a basic peppermint flavor that I'm not getting any off-notes from. It's a little sweet, but a very simple, one-dimensional flavor, nothing special to make it taste like hard candy, though that simple peppermint does read candy. Not too cool for a natural peppermint but lacks the nuance for that.

I‚Äùm really partial to the bitey cold peppermint flavors like FLV Peppermint and INW Shisha Peppermint, so I could toss it and not feel a great loss, but there are a couple of hard-to-resist recipes I want to try first.

[Wonderland](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/79218#wonderland_thechristmasmix_by_frictionvapes) **TASK 11**

[Christmas in July](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/282558#christmas_in_july_by_sensory_overload) **TASK 12**

**Candy Corn**

I know I tried this, but I can barely remember it. Best I can recall it was very accurate, including being waxy as hell, like eating a corn syrup flavored candle with hints of honey and maybe vanilla. I don't need that. Real candy corns are actually gross, I don't know why I somehow forget about once a year and have to remind myself with a handful or two, but they are. **TRASH 3**

**Candy Watermelon**

The first thing I noticed when trying this is how it lacks that thicker candy body. It's really quite thin, but wet thinness instead of a dry one. Like watered down watermelon snow cone syrup, but really watered down because it's also missing that sweetness. Instead, it also seems to have a little bit of soapy aftertaste for me. I'm prone to getting that from melons and others aren't so you might not have a problem with it, but as for me, I'll probably avoid this one in favor of other options. **TRASH 4**

**Cantaloupe**

That is not good. Artificial, tastes like melon medicine or nail polish. Sweet and clearly a melon, but just has this slight medicinal chemical thing running all the way through it. The medicinal thing in FW Cantaloupe seems to fade over time but it also becomes less of a cantaloupe and more of generic melon that even leans a little bit more watermelon-y than cantaloupey. **TRASH 5**

**Cappuccino**

Burnt toast milk farts. Seriously tastes like badly burnt toast dipped in milk, but not a lot of body to it, it's airy, like a dry fart, without much substance to it. **TRASH 6**

**Caramel Candy**

It's an unusually strong flavor for FW. At 2%, tastes like a slightly overcooked Werther's? It's very sweet and a little thick and creamy but that slightly acrid burnt sugar is annoying. At 1% I don't taste anything burnt but the flavor is a little softer overall; would use this with another caramel to make it taste more candy-like or as a light sweet caramel accent to other flavors, below 2%. Trying to use it as a full caramel candy flavor probably is not going to work because it tastes burnt before the flavor really fills out.

I'll give this interesting one a try: [Dirty White Boy and a Uno Dos Tres](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/164814#dirty_white_boy_and_a_uno_dos_tres_by_bjorama) **TASK 13**

**Caramel Cinnamon Roll**

I get a bit of maple as an off-note in here, but for the most part, it's just their cinnamon roll with nice gooey caramel just infused throughout the vape. Not as much cinnamon as the regular Cinnamon Roll. So many things you can do with it. Maybe just add some more cinnamon, maybe nuts and raisins, some cream cheese icing and make it a big ol ooey gooey cinnamon roll with everything.

I want to try Emily's [Caramel Cinnamon Cronut](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/192755#mlnikon_s_caramel_cinnamon_cronut_by_mixinvixens). **TASK 14**

And her [Coffee Cake](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/145202#mlnikon_s_coffee_cake_by_mixinvixens). **TASK 15**

And this [Cinnamon Streusel 4321.5](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/291186#cinnamon_streusel_4321_5_by_timboslice). **TASK 16**

**Cheesecake**

Tastes more like cream cheese frosting than a cheesecake, but with a little less vanilla and a little more richness and cheesiness, while still not quite getting there as cheesecake. Creamy, just not quite as dense as I want from cheesecake, but still a good cheesecake component. Very sweet. Maybe a little bakery accent, but not a distinct crust. That cream cheese tartness tastes a bit funky in the finish. Not vomit, but there's a little bit of that belchy quality there. Like when you burp and it tastes good, but also a bit yucky. The burpiness can definitely be covered up in a mix, but it's a bit off-putting standalone. And I didn't see anything that made me want to keep it. **TRASH 7**

**Cherry Balsam Tobacco**

Lots of artificial cherry along with a fairly atrocious amount of that awful new vinyl shower curtain liner off note that lingers and leaves that nasty chemical taste in my mouth, with a base of turpentine syrup. It's sweet and thick but tastes like turpentine. Seriously, just like turpentine. No tobacco in sight. **TRASH 8** but maybe keep it in the garage in case I need to clean a paintbrush? Just kidding, I don't even have a garage.

**Cherry Berry**

Too much Berry to just be Cherry, but if you're looking to mix a cherry with berry anyway, or doing something abstract, this has a nice, you can get a nice, fairly clean candy cherry note out of this. I get a touch of cough syrup creeping in at 3% but not really at 2%, and still a good amount of flavor at 2%. It's a sweet (but a bit watered down) strawberry syrup blended with a cherry lifesaver type flavor. It's just a bit soft and not super saturated before it starts to get a little medicinal and more like a cherry cough drop. I don't feel like messing with it. **TRASH 9**

**Cherry Blast**

Do you want to vape a cherry cough drop? Well, here it is buddy. A cough droppy red cherry with no shower curtain liner, with a medium - not heavy or light - menthol that tastes almost exactly like a Halls cherry cough drop. If you wanted it to be absolutely perfect maybe get a little INW Euc with mint in there, but it's already very close. If you are a person looking for a cough drop flavor on purpose for whatever reason, knock yourself out. I‚Äùm not interested in that. **TRASH 10**

**Cherry Crush**

Very sweet and red cherry that tastes like flat cherry soda but has a thick yet fluffy texture like a cherry marshmallow. I get just enough new vinyl shower curtain liner at 2% to ruin it, but at 1% I'm not sure if it's really there or if I'm just imagining it. Unfortunately the flavor is also so light down there I'm not sure it works as a single cherry in a cherry mix, but it's not awful. And even at 2% the shower curtain to overall flavor ratio is better than most. It's possible it could be covered up in a mix, or steep out eventually.

I think it's going in the trash but I'm too curious to not try this [Chocolate Cherry Cake](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/45461#chocolate_cherry_cake_by_choose) first. **TASK 17**

**Chocolate Mint**

I was hoping for liquid Andes but instead there's a tiny bit of mint that might be peppermint on top of a lot of very bad chocolate. I say tiny bit, I can feel more than taste it, but it's just a little. The concentrate itself is dark brown and syrupy thick, definitely a gunker. The chocolate tastes bitter, dirty, and dry. If you want a chocolate mint, build your own. If you already have this for some reason, maybe it will work in a tobacco or coffee where that bitterness and dirt won't be so problematic. **TRASH 11**

**Chocolate Tobacco**

Should be called charcoal tobacco. And that it is a shame because chocolate tobacco can be an amazing profile, but this is foul and really does taste like doing a line of the powder from the bottom of a bag of charcoal briquets. Sweeter than that would be but yeah, basically chop me a line of kingsford and pass the straw. **TRASH 12**

**Cinnamon**

Candy cinnamon with a hint of clove and more harshness than it should have for the amount of flavor. Cinnamon with a hint of clove sounds like a start to a nice bakery spice blend, but when the cinnamon taste like cinnamon bears candy, having a hint of clove is really weird. Like, let's just sprinkle some clove on these cinnamon bears, that makes sense. I think it's eugenol that's supposed to make the cinnamon taste more like bakery cinnamon but it doesn't fit together properly. Also making sense is cinnamon flavors being a bit rough, that's a thing. But this one seems to hit me in the throat harder than it should. Thick but bland and not particularly sweet body more along the lines of cinnamon bears than Red Hots or Hot Tamales. The clove could get covered up, though, in a mix, so it might work for a good cinnamon candy, but the harshness I get from it would also have to be mitigated. **TRASH 13**

**Cinnamon Churro**

This is terrible. It tastes like it has toilet bowl cleaner in it. Often you encounter a chemical off note and all you can say its it's a chemical off note and not a specific chemical but in this one I'm getting a chemical off note that is strongly reminiscent of the toilet bowl cleaner I use. The top note is very light powdery, slightly candied cinnamon, but beneath that, there's something doughy, not fried crispy/chewy like a churro, that's laced with a hint of the smell of a clean toilet, along with a bit of creamy cheesecake-like flavor that also doesn't belong in a churro. I don't know what the hell this is, but it's not a churro, and it's actually pretty nasty. It has a lingering greasy mouthfeel that I guess is sort-of accurate for something fired, but yuck. It also has a bit of throat hit, which is weird because the cinnamon is pretty light, and it's one of the flavors that has fructose in it, and unlike Cake Batter Dip and maybe Yellow Cake, it's definitely not worth that. The only thing I'm putting this flavor in is a garbage can. **TRASH 14**

**Cinnamon Roll**

Out of all the flavors I've tried with ‚ÄúRoll‚Äù in the name, this one comes the closest to being an actual cinnamon roll. There's something just a little ‚Äúartificial‚Äù about the whole thing, but all the parts are in place and pretty much taste like they should. It's got a rich, bakery cinnamon and a sugary sweet gooey buttery dough base and finishes into something that might be a little frosting. Does have a little throat hit to it, but not enough to prevent me from wanting to use it, just enough to make me think twice about mixing it with other flavors that have that.

There are some great-looking recipes made out of this that I can't wait to try, starting with this [Honey Bunz](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/252552#honey_bunz_by_kylezkloudz) recipe. I have an old Honey Buns recipe, and an idea for an updated version (built around CAP Sticky Bun) on my to-do list, but if this recipe is as good as it looks, that might be unnecessary. **TASK 18**

For a straight up cinnamon roll, [Cinna Bomb](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/239575#cinna_bomb_cinnamon_roll_w_cream_cheese_icing_by_alch3m1st) looks to be on-point. **TASK 19**

And finally, getting a little wacky, [Brainy](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/33933#ejm_first_25_brainy_by_concreteriver). Cinnamon Roll RY4, with a blueberry accent. In four flavors. **TASK 20**

**Citrus Soda**

Also known as ‚ÄúMax Dew‚Äù at Flavor Jungle. Can confirm these are the same thing by taste. Also, FW doesn't even have a Max Dew on their website, this is just Flavor Jungle relabeling shit, or maybe using one of FW's old names before they got a C&D from Mountain Dew. Anyway, don't buy both Max Dew and Citrus Soda, exact same thing. Really does mostly taste like Mountain Dew - lemon lime with some orange and lots of sugar, basically - even has a slight almost bubbly sort of minerally powder thing going on that mimics some carbonation. I was surprised and impressed by this flavor, though it's far from perfect. It all comes across a little soapy to me, first of all. But I'm always whining about soapy and I'm not whining very loud about this one. The top notes are a little too zesty or rindy for Mountain Dew. It's so sticky sweet that it gets dry with extended vaping. And once you get past the zestier top notes, the sweet flavor is otherwise a bit soft and tastes like it might get lost in a mix. But if you really want to vape Mountain Dew, this by itself at 3 to 4% ought to do it, though of course you could jazz it up a bit, especially with some juicier and bolder components. Maybe even just a little of that LB Dew Mountain (3%ish?) to fill in the base more would fix it completely.

I'll give a couple of things a try.

[Cactus Soda](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/227998#cactus_soda_developed2banger_by_x5w15hx) **TASK 21**

[Mango Lemonade](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/237592#mango_lemonade_by_joesjuice) **TASK 22**

**Coconut Cream Pie**

It tastes like a coconut-flavored marshmallow. I didn't get pie crust or distinct layers of whipped cream and coconut cream from it, but I did get a pretty tasty coconut-flavored marshmallow. At 4% the coconut is mild and not aggressively artificial. It has a thick, full, sweet mouthfeel and the base flavor here tastes pretty distinctly like a marshmallow. Unfortunately FW Coconut Cream Pie one of those that contains a form of sugar. And there are plenty of options that don't. **TRASH 15**

**Coffee Cake**

I think this one somehow slipped the cracks and never got tested. At least, I don't remember trying it. Will mix a sample at 4%. **TASK 23**

**Cookie Butter**

Man, fuck this flavor. I hate this fucking flavor so much. It's a how many licks does it take to get to the center?-type game only instead it's how many puffs until my cotton and coils are ruined.

Some of my hate for this stuff stems from the idea that it's supposed to taste like Cookie Butter. It does not taste like cookie butter, and if you're hoping that it will, it tastes like the bitterest of disappointments.

Cookie Butter is.... It's super addictive orgasmic drug butter that tastes like a handful of sexy gingerbread people having an orgy in your mouth on a bed of uncut cocaine and cumming gooey Christmas mornings and sugar-crusted rainbows all over the place. The first time you try it, it's like getting your virginity back and then losing it again, but to Marilyn Monroe while she's singing happy birthday to you, because you're the fucking president. Real cookie butter tests my lack of faith because it's the strongest evidence I've seen that there is a god and he or she loves us.

FW Cookie Butter, on the other hand, I got to about 22 puffs of a single-flavor sample at 2.5% before it started to taste increasingly bitter, burnt, and dry. Prior to that, it wasn't unpleasant but was... odd. Like a weird take on cookies and cream, not Oreo cookies and cream, but a weird very dark cookie with weird cream that's sort of like soggy gingersnaps minus the ginger, that are soggy because they've been dipped in malted milk, emphasis on the malt. It's shockingly malty and that maltiness lingers. If you don't know what Cookie Butter is, and the name made you think butter cookie, there will be disappointment there too, as there's no butter flavor. Not really a milk flavor either, just a lot of creaminess in the middle that fades into a dryness at the end, resulting in this odd dichotomy of creamy and almost wet mouthfeel upfront with a very dry malty finish. Not getting any spice notes, just malt.

By about 30 puffs, my fresh cotton was looking solidly crunchy and abused, and this no longer tastes good at all. It starts to get ashy and the dryness ramps up. It's losing that creaminess and the bakery flavor is starting to get replaced by something like burnt malted caramel or molasses. Redrip and more of the original flavor returns briefly but it's never quite as good as those 20 puffs or so.

At 50 puffs it's pretty much unvapeable. My cotton is dark brown and what it has left on my coils is just wrong. It's a caked on concrete-like substance that won't just dry burn and rinse off, I had to toss my coils. Fuck you Flavor West Cookie Butter. **TRASH 16**

**Cookies & Cream**

I assume it's supposed to be an Oreo Ice Cream as opposed to just an Oreo. If it's supposed to be just Oreo it failed hard, if it's supposed to be cookies & cream Ice Cream it did reasonably well if you're talking about a cheap, airy, icy ice cream like those children's birthday party ice creams and not a richer and creamier, perhaps even eggy/custardy, premium ice cream. The cream is very sweet but also pretty fluffy, light. The chocolate cookie on top is light and lacking any cookie crunch. It's also just a tad off, like something somewhere between an Oreo cookie and a toasted tootsie roll. So you could say it's not a terrible Cookies & Cream Ice Cream flavor and I wouldn't disagree with you, but it also kind of tastes like a bruleed tootsie roll on top of a pile of whipped cream from a can. **TRASH 17**

**Cranberry**

This is an odd one. The first thing that came to mind wasn't cranberry, but sweet-tarts candy. Digging into it, it doesn't really precisely taste like sweet tarts, but it does taste more like sweet tarts than any kind of cranberry I've ever had. The berry flavor in here lightly floral and does taste more like cranberry than any other berry, but not quite right. It's also a little harsh at 3%. But there's a base to it and that base is sweet tart candy. Maybe a cranberry flavored sweet tart, maybe? It also starts to feel a little soapy with extended vaping. **TRASH 18**

**Cream Soda Type**

Have not tried, will mix a 6% sample. **TASK 24**

**Creamy Chocolate Cake**

Thin and somewhat dry chocolate cake that's a bit light on the chocolate, to the extent that it tastes more like thin amount of slightly waxy chocolate frosting leaching into a regular cake a bit. I guess it's supposed to have a cream filling but I'm not really getting a cream feeling here, it seems to just be a dry cream taste like freeze-dried ice cream or something that's washing out a lot of the cake, so that it's dry but not really grainy and cakey. It is sweet, but just not rich in any way. Like several of the other chocolate cake flavors, it seems like it needs a lot of help in every way to be what it's supposed to be, which is like a Ding Dong, I think. More bakery, more richness within the bakery, more chocolate, some actual cream... and, at that point, is this even necessary? **TRASH 19**

**Creamy Coconut**

Very sweet, rich, smooth flavor, but very imitation coconut-flavor tasting. Almost suntan lotion at 2%, probably would be suntan lotion any higher. Maybe used lower with a cream flavor and another less fake coconut could get a good coconut cream out of it. I have so many better coconuts. **TRASH 20**

**Creamy Hazelnut**

It's a hazelnut flavor. It's weird because it is drier and LESS CREAMY and smooth than the regular Hazelnut. Lightly sweet, seems to have a little vanilla cream flavor to it, but without the nice creamy feeling or mouthfeel. Seems rather inessential really, especially if it doesn't have the additive properties of regular FW Hazelnut.

But it's not unnecessary if it's used in a recipe that's necessary, and there are a couple I want to try, just in case.

[Butterscotch Hazelnut Pudding](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/132547#butterscotch_hazelnut_pudding_by_collectron) **TASK 25**

[Praline Ice Cream](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/218726#praline_ice_cream_by_sensory_overload). **TASK 26**

**Creamy Sponge Cake**

Emphasis on the creamy. It's mostly cream, just a bit of bakery that does kinda taste like an eggy and slightly buttery sponge cake. Like 80% cream, 20% cake. The cream does taste quite a bit like the cream from the inside of a Twinkie or Ding-Dong. A light, bright artificial vanilla cream. It's also a little dry and doesn't have that oily mouth-coating thing -- It's like a poor man's VT Sweet Cream. There's some nice separation between the cream and cake but not just a lot of cake here. Very slight plasticky weirdness near the end, probably not much cause for concern in a mix. Lingering sweetness. Seems like you would need to help both the cream and the cake to make a Twinkie or Swiss Roll out of this, and that point... do you really need this? There are a number of great-looking recipes out there that do exactly that but I wonder if they couldn't be revised to not need it? As for as using it for less-obvious or more abstract things, I swear it tastes like it would be amazing mixed with banana, like in a banana cream recipe, but I couldn't tell you why, it's just a weird hunch.

Well, here it is with some banana, so I pretty much have try that: [Banana Stacks](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/212012#banana_stacks_by_folkart). **TASK 27**

Also [Banana Flip](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/188685#banana_flip_by_grumpyoldfart). Just how old is that Grumpy Old Fart, I wonder? **TASK 28**

Also, [Rolling in the Deep](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/147500#rolling_in_the_deep_by_tamvapes) looks amazing. **TASK 29**

Might as well try a couple of Twinkie recipes while I'm at it:

[Twink](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/152908#twink_by_dumhed). **TASK 30**

[Twinkie](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/296956#twinkie_by_sorteal). **TASK 31**

**Creme de Menthe**

Lovely flavor used wonderfully in Shyndo's [Mint Chip Cookies and Cream](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/117147#mint_chip_cookies_and_cream_by_shyndo) recipe. I need it to make more of that **TASK 32**

FW Creme de Menthe is a sweet and mild peppermint with a touch of creaminess underneath. It doesn't have any of the booze note like you might expect from an accurate Creme de Menthe flavor, but aside from that and the mint being a bit subdued, it's a great ingredient for something like a mint chocolate chip ice cream, thin mint cookie, or mint hot chocolate. By itself, even with the concentration cranked up, lacks the minty intensity for things like Junior Mints or Peppermint Patties or an actual Creme de Menthe vape.

I've been meaning to try [Here Come the Boys](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/30486#here_come_the_boys_by_mlnikon) forever. **TASK 33**

**Crunchy Cereal**

It's nothing at all like Cap'n Crunch. It's mostly like sweet, toasty vanilla. Like a weird attempt at a toasted vanilla marshmallow or a vanilla marshmallow covered in toasted breadcrumbs. No real grain to it, doesn't taste corny. Could find a way into a recipe because it's not gross and has elements that could complement other flavors well, but it isn't Cap'n Crunch at all. When I tried it at 3%, I didn't get anything special I'd call an off-note, other than the whole thing is basically an off-note. When it pushed it to 4%, it started to take on a little earthy edge - not quite fungal, but heading off in that mushroomy direction - right on top. **TRASH 21**

**Cucumber Mint**

It's not a great cucumber because there's not a lot of cucumber there. It's like taking a sip of cucumber water with a wad of spearmint gum in your mouth. So it's a little weird, but super refreshing. It's pleasant and there's nothing really off about it. 3% I get more of a mint that tastes a little like Wrigley's Doublemint Spearmint gum. At 4% to 5% I get a little better balance between the cucumber and mint. I'm surprised that the green juicy naturalness of cucumber doesn't make the mint taste more leafy and natural, but there's some separation here and the mint still has more of a gum/candy kind of mint at first, then that juicy fresh vegetable taste. I guess you could try to bend the mint into a little more natural leafy mint like you probably imagine with cucumber (rather than chewing gum) with some of that Sobucky Super Aroma Garden Mint. I'm pretty fond of this flavor, it makes a nice refreshing palate cleansing vape just by itself. But I don't have a mix I need it for. Let's see if one of these can change that:

[Apollo 420](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/229464#apollo_420_by_danielthevapeman) **TASK 34**

[PRIDE Red - Watermelon Mint Sweet Tea](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/157729#pride_red_mix_watermelon_mint_sweet_tea_by_mech_mod_rn). **TASK 35**

**Double Apple**

Yikes. It tastes more like a collection of chemicals not fit for human consumption than an apple. Some nail polish remover, some wood varnish, a mix of sweet red and tart green apple, and some weird, bitter spice note. Dry. **TRASH 22**

**Double Mint Gum**

Tastes like spearmint chewing gum. Mint isn't double strong as the name would suggest. It's a bit muted. On the other hand it's not ABC gum because it even has that sort of powdery coating of a fresh stick of gum mingled with the spearmint. Sweet but otherwise bland body, not thin, really very accurate to a stick of chewing gum, which it turns out, isn't that much fun to vape for me. But if you're a fan of Wrigley's Doublemint Spearmint Gum, go for it. **TRASH 23**

**Dulce De Leche**

I know I've tried this, but I don't remember trying it, so it must not have been exceptionally bad or exceptionally good. It's in a recipe I added to my to-mix list last week so I can't toss it yet. I'll mix a 3% sample and try to refresh my memory. **TASK 36**

**Dutch Apple Pie**

First of all, it's one of those flavors that has sugar in it, not a good idea to be vaping that. Second, and perhaps more importantly, it's not very good. It's not gross, it has a very nice pie crust flavor, rich and buttery, but there are other better pie crust flavors without sugar in them. Not a lot of apple, it's faint. Just a hint of spice. **TRASH 24**

**Eggnog**

Imagine your job in quality control is ‚ÄúNutmeg Taster.‚Äù You wouldn't want to taste test straight nutmeg, so you come up with the plan of mixing the freshly grated warm spice with a small amount of Cool Whip. That's what this is. There's a very light, fairly fluffy sweet cream base, but it's nothing at all like the thickness and depth of flavor of eggnog. Or even anything at all that makes it read eggnog and not just a small amount of generic light sweet cream. I can't find any weird off notes or anything like that, though. It seems like a great option for a smoother, more forgiving nutmeg option vs the highly potent DEATH BY NUTMEG flavor that is TFA Holiday Spice.But it's mostly just nutmeg. I can't imagine needing to use this when I have FLV Eggnog. **TRASH 25**

**Extreme Ice**

I have tried it, but don't remember what it tastes like. I know it's basically an additive and I don't have any interest in vaping it standalone again. But I do have an interest in trying this [So Icey Gang](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/212304#so_icey_gang_by_germ) blue raspberry recipe that uses it. **TASK 37**

**Fig**

Not unpleasant, but also, not a fig. Like not at all. It tastes kinda bubblegummy, like in the same way Red Bull tastes a bit bubblegummy. There's some darkness there, but it tastes more like grape than fig. Not grape bubblegum, but grape and pink bubblegum mixed together. It even has that kinda powdery bubblegum feel. I'm not really tasting a spice in the top note, but FW Fig does feel like if I pushed the concentration much higher than 2% it might start to get just a little cinnamony or clovey. I have no interest in messing with this aside from one old ChemicalBurnVictim recipe that I'm missing a flavor for and not going to buy. **TRASH 26**

**French Vanilla**

Is it vanilla? Yes. Is it perfectly good enough to use? Yes again. But, it's kinda chalky/dry, and it's not what I have in mind at all when I'm going for ‚Äúfrench vanilla‚Äù - It's really bright like candy vanilla or cheap poor kid's birthday party vanilla ice cream. Pretty sweet, but not much else going on. Pretty plain beyond being really bright vanilla, some body, but nothing like cream or custard body, more like chalky candy, almost like the stick that comes with Fun Dip, but not as authentic to that as the WF Candy Stick Candy.

Gotta hang on to it at least long enough to mix one of the recipes added to the list last week. I'd also like to try this [Lonesome Custard](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/180417#lonesome_custard_by_lonesomerhodestn), as this mixer has made some amazing recipes and I'm always on the lookout for my new favorite vanilla custard recipe. **TASK 38**

There's more, but the character limits got me, so Part 20 will be up momentarily.
