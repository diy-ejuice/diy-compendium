#CAPELLA JELLY CANDY

Update after mixing six bottles of different juices in search of a use for CAP Jelly Candy. None of them were stellar, but I'm not giving up. I left 3- or 4-star reviews on ATF for the ones by others I tried.

My first attempt to update my old [Mango Tango](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/29425-mango_tango) recipe for a mango Hot Tamale profile went like this:

Mango Tango 2 v1:

| Co. | Flavor                  | %    |
| --- | ----------------------- | ---- |
| CAP | Jelly Candy             | 3    |
| FLV | Red Cinnamon            | 0.25 |
| FA  | Indian Mango            | 3    |
| CAP | Super Sweet             | 0.50 |
| WF  | Cotton Candy Jelly Bean | 1    |
| FLV | Sweet Mango             | 1    |

I was very happy with the Hot Tamale part - that WF Cotton Candy Jelly Bean really took that to the next level. But the mango was underwhelming. I'll try again, with a little more mango this time and see if it punches more without getting weird.

Mango Tango 2 v2 **TASK 1**

| Co. | Flavor                  | %    |
| --- | ----------------------- | ---- |
| CAP | Jelly Candy             | 3    |
| FLV | Red Cinnamon            | 0.25 |
| FA  | Indian Mango            | 4    |
| CAP | Super Sweet             | 0.50 |
| WF  | Cotton Candy Jelly Bean | 1    |
| FLV | Sweet Mango             | 1.5  |

My first attempt to update my old [Spicy Icy](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/116249-spicy_icy_chamoyada_mangonada__) recipe went worse.

I mixed this:

| Co. | Flavor        | %    |
| --- | ------------- | ---- |
| FLV | Apple Filling | 1.25 |
| FLV | Heat          | 1.5  |
| FLV | Sweet Mango   | 2    |
| FLV | Mango         | 2    |
| FA  | Indian Mango  | 2    |
| CAP | Jelly Candy   | 1    |
| CAP | Super Sweet   | 0.5  |
| FA  | Polar Blast   | 1.25 |
| BCF | WS-23 (30%)   | 1.75 |
| TFA | Sweet & Tart  | 0.5  |

And the result was a slightly perfumy disaster. Which is very weird because the original was pleasantly painful in that fire-and-ice way and not at all perfumy. And I didn't really change much: Removed CAP Sweet Mango 3%, added FLV Sweet Mango 2% and FA Indian Mango 2%, dropped FLV Mango from 4% to 2%. All of which I thought would be a slight improvement to the mango portion. WRONG! I'll try a simpler approach and see if I can get the essential parts right, then worry about the finer details later. And turn those mangoes down just a smidge.

Spicy Icy 2, V2 **TASK 2**

| Co. | Flavor       | %    |
| --- | ------------ | ---- |
| FLV | Heat         | 1.5  |
| FLV | Sweet Mango  | 1.5  |
| FLV | Mango        | 1.5  |
| FA  | Indian Mango | 1.5  |
| CAP | Jelly Candy  | 1    |
| CAP | Super Sweet  | 0.5  |
| FA  | Polar Blast  | 1.25 |
| BCF | WS-23 (30%)  | 1.75 |

#LORANN'S FLAVORS

**Apricot**

Haven't tried this. I couldn't find the bottle when I was testing a bunch of other apricot flavors to compare them. But now it's been located, I'll mix 2 and 4% samples. **TASK 3**

**Banana Cream**

Top note is banana Laffy Taffy without the taffy texture, base is kinda like creamy banana pudding but a little thinner, like a mixture of pudding with actual bananas and a banana snack pack. Should probably be kept below 3% for most mixes, otherwise it's really strong Laffy Taffy that overpowers stuff. I also get a little added throat hit from it, not enough to keep me from using it, but maybe enough to be worth noting.

I've already planned to mix a couple of recipes that use it. Didn't take long to find a couple more that look good or at least too interesting to pass up:

[Banana Papaya Punch](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/164088-papaya_banana_punch). **TASK 4**

[Nana Cream Fizz Pop](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/151760-nana_cream_fizz_pop_) Banana cream soda pop! **TASK 5**

**Bavarian Cream**

Tastes yogurty. Like Dannon Vanilla Yogurt. Almost exactly the same vanilla as those yogurts, and quite vanilla forward, also very sweet and creamy smooth, with some caramel behind it. But that dairy twang goes over into yogurty tartness, which is not what I'm generally looking for in a Bavarian Cream. I could see using it in all kinds of recipes, but if I just really wanted to vape Dannon Vanilla Yogurt, I'd head over to VSO and get that Spork Pudding vanilla, it also tastes like Dannon Vanilla Yogurt to me, even more than LA Bavarian Cream, and it's a richer, more deeply saturated Dannon vanilla yogurt experience, like the difference between Original and Light vanilla yogurt, plus you get a cool little spork. **TRASH 1**

**Blackberry**

A flat, one dimensional flavor that tastes like someone made a flavor for a candy based on Arbor Mist Blackberry Merlot. Doesn't taste like candy - it's not that sweet and lacks real body - it tastes like a flavor to be used in a candy. Really very close to that merlot, minus the boozy fermentation. Despite being very grapey and not having much depth to it, it's reasonably flavorful, just a little thin, without any off notes, other than a bunch of dark grape combined with the blackberry. No recipes on ATF use it. **TRASH 2**

**Blueberry**

Not sure why I have this, possibly it was ordered by mistake. It's a blue-colored liquid. **TRASH 3**

**Blueberry (Colorless)**

Candy blueberry, not realistic at all. But, sweet without being syrupy sweet, a bit flat. And so dry that it might be a good building block for something like a pixie stick type of thing. Not sure what else to do with it. **TRASH 4**

**Bubble Gum**

Definitely tastes like Pink bubblegum, every easy to identify what it is. But thin and a little harsh, fairly light in flavor, especially in terms of the amount of flavor in exchange for that harshness. Slight hint of vague fruitiness that seems out of place.

It's probably going to tear my throat up but this [Bubblegum: Lemonade](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/189746-bubblegum_lemonade) looks too good to skip. **TASK 6**

**Butterscotch**

I get hit right away with an odd chemical taste, not a very strong one, but strong enough to be a nuisance, followed by something like caramel cotton candy, where it's very sweet and is caramel-tasting, but also a bit dry and otherwise not very flavorful. There's a little more depth to the caramel candy body beyond that, but it's still pretty dry. It does have a nice smooth buttery finish that lingers. It seems like it might be a bit of a pain to work with, but it's not awful. It helps having that off-note upfront where it could be forgiven thanks to the buttery finish, versus having it linger in the end. I wouldn't be adverse to trying a recipe with it in there, but there are a lot of better options for butterscotch flavors, and I didn't see any such recipes. **TRASH 5**

**Cake Batter**

Mostly tastes like dry vanilla milk powder. If I had to relate it to cake batter, I'd say tastes like messed up cake batter without nearly enough eggs and butter added to it yet. It has some body to it but it's not very creamy or rich, just thick and dry, and not particularly enjoyable. It does smooth out more toward the finish, as the vanilla kicks up higher, but it's still pretty dry. **TRASH 6**

**Caramel**

This has a nice flavor. I wouldn't call it a full-on, spot-on caramel - the taste is just a little too brown sugary for that - but there's a lovely richness to it like caramel sauce has, without actually tasting exactly like caramel sauce, and it is like yummy dark sweetness. Not an amazing caramel, but a pretty solid one, comparatively (I've tried a bunch of them). Nothing I want to try uses it. **TRASH 7**

**Cheesecake**

Tastes kind of like a cheesy vanilla marshmallow, or a cream cheese vanilla frosting. Very sweet but dry, fluffy, like a marshmallow, not super rich and creamy. Bright vanilla and lots of it, but an underlying cream cheese note. No crust at all, doesn't even really taste like a cooked cheesecake. Tastes like that bright vanilla might go a bit anise-y if oversaturated, I would be careful about using it more than 3%. I wouldn't rely on this to provide all or even most of the cream cheese flavor in a cheesecake recipe, but I wouldn't hesitate to come to a cheesecake party where this is also in attendance. I'd also use it as a vanilla cream cheese frosting for something like a cake or cupcake, and it tastes like it might be a neat addition to a vanilla custard recipe.

There are several great-looking recipes that use this flavor. Two of them I've previously planned to mix, both by [LonesomeRhodesTN](https://alltheflavors.com/mixers/LonesomeRhodesTN). Might as well add one more by Lonesome: [Cream of Serenity](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/176414-cream_of_serenity). It's like Adirondack's Placid, made into a sherbet. **TASK 7**

Excited to try this one, too: [Cream Cheese Filled French Toast](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/75362-cream_cheese_filled_french_toast). Yum! **TASK 8**

**Cherry**

Robutussin with a bit of new vinyl shower curtain liner, but sweet. Really strong. Might be workable at a very low concentration if the goal is some kind of cough drop or cherry sizzurp recipe or something weird like that, but I don't want to taste anything with this in it. **TRASH 8**

**Chocolate (Colorless)**

Cardboard, mostly. There's some actual chocolate in there but it's mostly buried under a pile of cardboard. LorAnn's wants everyone to know their flavors aren't meant for vaping, they could use this as proof. **TRASH 9**

**Coconut**

Aggressively fake coconut, almost suntan lotion. Not as sweet as a lot of other coconuts. I don't know why you'd need a coconut that's candy fake but not candy sweet, but that's what this is. It's also got that sort of candy flat one-note-ness to it. I've got a lot of coconut flavors, too many to keep such a below average one. **TRASH 10**

**Cotton Candy**

It tastes like mostly ethyl maltol but there's also triacetin and maybe something else in there. It has a distinct fullness to it and feels kind of creamy, almost oily, not as dry as plain just EM or Cotton Candy. It has the effect of tasting like a cotton candy-flavored sucker more than just cotton candy. I kind of dig it, but nothing I want to make uses it, and WF Cotton Candy Jelly Bean is similar but better. **TRASH 11**

**Cream Cheese Icing**

Does kinda taste like cream cheese icing. It's got a little of that cheesy tang like uncooked cream cheese and sweetness like powdered sugar. But it's also a little... I don't know, “fake-ish.” It tastes like an artificial flavor. Which of course it is. BUT, if you taste One-On-One Vanilla Custard Cheesecake (a poorly named flavor that doesn't taste like custard or cheesecake at all but does taste like amazing cream cheese icing) and LA CCI side-by-side as single flavors, you'd be probably be inclined to throw LA CCI away. And I might do that, someday. But not today because LA CCI is an ingredient in some of my most favorite recipes of all time. It's also in a bunch of recipes I've already put in line to try. Here are couple more, they look so good:

[King Cake](https://alltheflavors.com/recipe/311432-king_cake_%F0%9F%92%9A%F0%9F%92%9B%F0%9F%92%9C). **TASK 9**
