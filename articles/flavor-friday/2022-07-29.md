## HS Magic Mix (formerly Fortune Strike?)

**Setup**: mtl STNG 0.8 Ohm 2.0 ID 28/40 clapton 28.5W

**nose:** literally smells like a dry and leafy tobacco in the bottle. kinda neat.  

**Description:**
4% - Surprisingly, at 4% this is coming across weak as fuck all. Ok I expected more based on the strength of the nose. I picked this one up for the supposed 'raisin'/dark fruit note it carries. Here, at 4, that is just a hint. I'm already kind of disappointed, mostly because I am not pushing this to 8% and buying buckets of it just to get a note I can get with an actual dark fruit (VT Red Dates, INW Dark for Pipe, INW Licorice, FLV Fig, et al). 8% is the suggested percent by u/ChemicalBurnVictim for that note (Noted Episode linked below in Second Opinions). Honestly, this is going to be a shit review because 4% is just too low to have a real opinion on this and, about 10 mLs into this 30 mL tester, I decided to push it into a recipe experiment (found below) because I lacked any interest to finish off the sample. What's it taste like? I don't fucking know, but here for me it tastes like a waste of time. At nearly $4 per 10mL I already wouldn't recommend it even if it were widely available, which it isn't.

*Suggested percent:* Solo? I can only assume 8% minimum based on what CBV said. In a mix? Not really sure, but I would guess 4% at minimum. I hear they get stronger after a steep, like 1-2 months. Not sure I have that level of patience. In fact, I know I dont.  

*Pairing ideas:* A pretty decent plain base with what I assume will be a better taste higher up, I'm sure you could use this for a solid solo w/accent styled vape. 8% this plus a little TPA Western for leather, some SC (im going with c-type for that dark fruit boost) and a drop or two of FLV Arabian for spice? The idea being to lean into that cig-a-like fruit note from HS, boost it with C-style and add some dark base, accent with TPA for authenticity and Arabian for zing.

Came out pretty decent so I tweaked it a bit to keep chasing an Analog replica that seems real enough but also tastes decent. Here's that version:

The idea here is to create an analog cig experience that is actually a nice flavor. The notes I wanted to be present are: tobacco, leather, raisin, ash, spice.

Feedback on this one was positive. In the end, I'll have to find a replacement for the MM and reimagine this again since MM (and C-Style) is hard to find. As for what I get out of it, I dont know I'd call it accurate to the what a fresh pack of Marlboro lights smells/tastes like, but it is pretty close. The INW/VT combo help sell that prune note, western brings a bit of leather, INW Arabian and Classic Cig bring the ashy/chemical burning zing... I dunno, it was pretty close overall. I'd have to replace the HS and likely will do something that is actually available, but the accents are on point. Maybe a bit too grassy for my tastes from the Classic Cig but I can't find a replacement for that weird lingering chemical note.

**Second Opinions:**
[Noted Asian Tobacco Episode 91](https://youtu.be/-QGyxqZz8Mw?t=6444): We have cbv suggesting that there is a raisin note when pushed up to 8%. I tried it in a mix at 8% and I liked it enough. I can't seem to justify buying a flavor that needs to be pushed to 8% to get its better notes, but he does give it some high praise.

> Kind of dry tobacco leaves, ashy, sweet smoked plum or prune in the background. Not really fruity or too sweet.

I could barely find any information about it on ELR or elsewhere so, you'll have to take my word for it. Lucky you!

## Final Thoughts

That elusive raisin note, if you're chasing it, may be worth the cost and pain of using this flavor up higher. Trying to figure out where in the world to order it from these days might be a bigger pain. At the time of posting, bcf diyvs nomnomz and chefs no longer carry it. I saw it at some other websites, some shadier lookin than others. I'm not so wowed that I feel the need to chase it down. Meh, another legacy/dead flavor review... You're welcome. That said, it's relevancy is that I've heard Boba's Bounty likely used this flavor and cbv does indeed use it in his [Fett’s Reward- A Tribute To Boba’s Bounty](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/114342) recipe. If this flavor is available to you and you want to try something decent or get your old school on, by all means deep dive.
