TASK OR TRASH - Each flavor gets assigned at least one task or it goes in the trash.

# Capella

**Black Currant**

Update. Way back in Part 3 (yes, that’s how far behind I am when it comes to mixing and trying this stuff) I gave CAP Black Currant one recipe to convince me I should keep it. It did not. **TRASH 1**

Speaking of blackcurrants...

# Chefs Super Concentrates

**Blackcurrant**

Last week I blasted through all my CSC flavors, or thought I did. Turns out I inadvertently left off their nice little blackcurrant. On one hand, I think between Flavour Art Blackcurrant, INW Shisha Blackcurrant, and CAP Sweet Currant, I’m not currant-ly hurting for currant flavors. On the other, this is pretty good stuff. A little oddly warm feeling but otherwise excellent. A little tart, very dark, sticky sweet, just funky enough. At 0.5% it tastes like it might get camphorus or medicinal if pushed too high but also tastes like it could or would need to go a little higher for a recipe with blackcurrant as the focus rather than just a secondary or tertiary flavor.

I’ll try gently increasing it to 0.75% and see how that goes **TASK 1**

# Chemnovatic

I only have a handful of these.

**Apricot**

Tastes more peachy than apricot to me, but more like a nice, very ripe peach than peach rings candy and could pass for apricot, maybe, in a mix, I guess. It also reminds me of JF Honey Peach, so it’s kind of a question of how much does JF Honey Peach taste like apricot to you? It’s got a lot of darker sweetness and isn’t a really bright flavor. Weak in concentration (I pushed it to 8% based on what someone suggested on ELR), but plenty of flavor. Not really thin, but a little flat, like it hits one note from start to finish other than starting one way and finishing another. I don’t feel compelled to find a way to use this, or see a recipe that uses it that I want to make, so even though it’s fine, I’m going to **TRASH 2** it.
  
**Butter**

It might disappear into almost any mix but the first thing I noticed about this is that it’s quite a bit too sweet for butter. At the same time, there’s a bit of a sour edge to it, like this butter sat out just a little too long. Not nearly as heavy and rich as I want a butter flavor to be, and a little soft/subtle overall. But for the most part, it tastes like butter. I have betta buttas. **TRASH 3**

**Cookie**

I don’t think I’ve tried this one yet. I’ll mix samples at 2% and 4%. **TASK 2**

**Grape**

Powerful purple artificial grape flavor. Not super concentrated, but once you get it up there, like at 5%,  it has some serious flavor. The first time I hit it I thought it had a bit of a medicinal edge, but a couple more hits and I’d pretty much forgotten about that. It tastes like flat grape soda, but way more intensely than so many others that are so soft and meh. It’s not a complex flavor, not super interesting by itself, but if you’re looking for a candy or soda type of grape, I’d pick this up, for sure.

Well, it tastes like flat grape soda, so I’ll start by trying to unflatten it using [Bert’s Soda Base](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/156816#berts_soda_base_by_staybert).

Grape Crush V1 **TASK 3**

Co. | Flavor | %
---|---|----
CNV | Grape | 5
FW | Grape Soda | 1
FLV | Citrus Soda | 1.25
CAP | Lemon Lime | 1
BCF | WS-23 (30%) | 0.5

FW Grape Soda is FILTHY with sucralose, more than most sweeteners. I’m trying to use it mostly in lieu of Super Sweet here, but also for a little bit of grape layering.  

**Kiwi**

Doesn’t taste “bad” to me but doesn’t taste anything like a kiwi, really. It tastes like some kind of tart yet sweet, funky melonish thing. It tastes natural, not candy, but like a fruit that doesn’t actually exist. **TRASH 4**

**Lemon Cream Wafer**

I still haven’t tried this, though I think I have mixed at least one recipe that uses it. People went nuts over it supposedly being the key to cloning this Lemon Tart commercial juice I’ve never tried.

Instead of trying it by itself, I’ll mix this recipe, it’s close enough: [Dinner Lady Lemon Tart](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/221632#dinner_lady_lemon_tart_single_flavour_by_ffoli) **TASK 4**

Might as well check out some of these other recipes while I’m at it.

Here’s another simple recipe that looks good: [EZ Lemon Tart](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/210784#ez_lemon_tart_by_dennisj66) **TASK 5**

This one looks even better at the cost of only the time to pull out and measure two more ingredients: [ADV Lemon Tart](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/212008#adv_lemon_tart_by_seltzgenius), so I’ll see if that’s worth it. **TASK 6**

And see what happens if you mix almost all the lemon bakery flavors together: [Lemon Bakehouse Queen](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/224556#the_lemon_bakehouse_queen_by_diydownunderpippa) **TASK 7**

I’m afraid of the SSA Clotted Cream in this but we’ll give it a shot anyway: [Breakfast Lemon Breakfast Biscuits](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/262637#mwc_breakfast_lemon_breakfast_biscuits_clotted_cream_shortbread_by_lynda_marie). **TASK 8**

Quite a few of these CNV Lemon Cream Wafter/VT Lemon Meringue Tart combos. I’ll try another [Cam’s Lemon Bar](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/281894#cam_s_lemon_bar_by_cam9535). **TASK 9**

And another [Lemon Premcake](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/211017#lemon_premcake_by_sanctum) **TASK 10**

And another, this one actually looks the yummiest of those to me: [Lemon Meringuey Curdy Cake](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/284871#lemon_meringuey_curdy_cake_by_kuri_santou) **TASK 11**

Finally, this recipe: [LMP](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/255234#lmp_by_lukeloop) had me at Crumble Topping and Cookie Butter. **TASK 12**

**Marshmallow**

It is unusual for two different flavors to taste so similar that they really work as substitutes for each other without changing and potentially messing up a recipe, but if you already have WF Marshmallow Gooey, I believe you do not need CNV Marshmallow. And vice versa. They taste almost identical if you try CNV at 1% and WF Marshmallow Gooey at 2%, so you only need half as much CNV Marshmallow. That would likely make CNV the more economical choice for many, but BCF has WF and not CNV and they keep giving me store credit for my recipe pack even though I can’t imagine who is still out there buying that stuff. So I’m going to keep WF and toss CNV, but just know if you make a recipe that uses CNV Marshmallow, people without it can still try your recipe, just tell them to use WF Marshmallow Gooey at twice the concentration. **TRASH 5**

**Passion Fruit**

Excellent passion fruit flavor. This one checks all the boxes, really bright and punchy tart top notes, very fresh and natural, a sweeter, darker, and very juicy body, a little funky tropicality. Lots of flavor, very full from one end to the other, not top heavy or thin. I would like a little more flavor than I got from a 2% sample but I think bumping it up a little would do that, and even 2% would be great in a mix. Throat hit less than your average lemon flavor.

None of the recipes that use it really made me excited so I’m just gonna mix my own thing.

Whipped Pineapple Passion V1 **TASK 13**

Co. | Flavor | %
---|---|----
CNV | Passion Fruit | 2.5
CAP | Fresh Pineapple | 2
INW | Dragon Fruit | 0.25
CAP | Vanilla Whipped Cream | 2
OoO | Marshmallow Vanilla | 2
  
**Sponge Cake**

Buttery, but not in a good way. There’s just way too much fake movie theater butter. It’s still overbearing to the point of ruining the flavor. It does taste like a real, eggy sponge cake otherwise, but a sponge cake drizzled with popcorn “butter.” Even if you think that doesn’t sound disgusting, you have to at least admit that it’s super weird. **TRASH 6**

**Sweet Cream**

Buttery, sweet, a little funky, a little dry on top but makes up for it with a smooth, fatty, mouthcoating finish. The funkiness is a bit cheesy tastes like probably butyric acid so it might be a no-go for people who are especially sensitive to the stuff, but doesn’t come across pukey to me, just a bit cheesy, both at 1% and 2%. I don’t need a slightly cheesy sweet cream, though I probably would have mixed someone's cheesecake recipe using it, I didn’t see one and don’t feel like I’m gonna miss out on something too terribly amazing if I just let it go. **TRASH 7**

**Vanilla Ice Cream**

Another instance where two flavors are so similar no one needs both. I can barely tell the difference between CNV Vanilla Ice Cream and MB Thick Vanilla Ice Cream, at the same concentration, side by side, on the same type of RDA. CNV Vanilla Ice Cream seemed just a little less sweet as a single flavor, but probably not enough to make such a difference in a mix that they can't be used interchangeably. I’m just going to keep the MB for now. **TRASH 8**

**Vanilla Pudding**

I don’t remember having tried this one yet. I’ll give it a mix at 2%. **TASK 14**

I’m sure it’s going to be good, because as best I can tell without knowing what it tastes like, people have made some incredible-looking recipes out of it. I want to try some of those as well.

[Creme de pudim](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/243100#creme_de_pudim_by_jhonnyamaral) **TASK 15**

[Bang Custard](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/257957#bang_custard_by_davidn2kl) **TASK 16**

[Apple Bobbin Noggin Custard](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/262544#apple_bobbin_noggin_custard_by_azzer) **TASK 17**

[Vanilla Pudding IYF](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/273392#vanilla_pudding_i_n_y_our_f_ace_by_jakinbox) **TASK 18**

[Pistachio Pud](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/222361#pistachio_pud_live_mixing_by_enyawreklaw) says SNV but I’m going to give TFA Whipped Cream a couple of weeks. **TASK 19**

[Vanilla Eggnog Cookie](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/236934#vanilla_eggnog_cookie_by_ledpedal) **TASK 20**

[Major](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/208557#major_by_wolfwheeler). I have concerns about the spiciness of Zeppola but Wolfwheeler tends to know what he’s doing. **TASK 21**

[Shunsui Kyōraku](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/251955#shunsui_kyoraku_by_wolfwheeler) I’m also concerned about the WF Egg Yolk, by itself I think it’s disgusting and doesn’t belong anywhere near my juice. But again, Wolfie. So, I’ll give it a try and this might be Egg Yolk’s one chance to not get binned. **TASK 22**

[Strawgo](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/245606#strawgo_by_tamvapes) **TASK 23**

[Mouthgasm](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/213970#mouthgasm_by_eyemsam). Do you ever feel like sometimes Sam is just weird for the sake of being weird? And yet, curiosity gets the better of me, I need to know what this tastes like. **TASK 24**

[50 Shades of Butterscotch](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/260912#50_shades_of_butterscotch_by_mindfloodz). Tie me up and do whatever you want to me, baby.  **TASK 25**

[Cum Bubbles](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/267373#cum_bubbles_by_gablona), gross name but unless that’s too much shortbread cookie for my taste I’m sure it’s yummy. I might just have to abbreviate it “CB” on the bottle. **TASK 26**

________________________________________________________________________

This was a short one because I was out of town most of the week remembering the Alamo, and the next one will probably be short, too, because I'm looking at a busy week of community and personal activities and catching up from being out of town. But I'll at least try to cover all the Club der Dampfer flavors that my friend Felix sent me from Germany.
