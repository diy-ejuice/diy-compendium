# CAPELLA FRUIT CIRCLES

Update. I tried two recipes that used CAP Fruit Circles. One of them I think had just a little too much Cereal 27. Kinda tasted like you put a bit of honey on a mixture of 3/4 Froot Loops and 1/4 Frosted Flakes. The other one, [Loopy Cake](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/190699) was delicious and I think it Perfectly matches description of "a medium bodied, fluffy vanilla cheesecake with speckled flecks of [fruity] cereal notes." It was a bit more lemony than I anticipated from the ingredients, but I like lemon, so it's all good. 5 stars, but just as a matter of personal profile preference, it won’t be going on my list of all-time favorite recipes. However, it did make me want to give CAP Fruit Circles recipes another look. All three of these look terrific, and if none of them reach favorite recipe status, I’ll be done with CAP Fruit Circles.

[Wadley Rings Ice Cream](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/171288#wadey_rings_ice_cream_by_lukeloop) What’s better than Froot Loops & milk? Froot Loops + Ice Cream! **TASK 1**

[Roronoa Zoro](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/276162#roronoa_zoro_by_wolfwheeler) Key Lime & Fruity Pebbles Cannoli. **TASK 2**

[mlNikon’s Pebble Donut](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/203438#mlnikon_s_pebble_donut_by_mixinvixens). **TASK 3**

# FLAVOUR ART

**Caramel**

Fantastic ingredient, not a great caramel. It’s sweet and kinda halfway between caramel and brown sugar. Maybe caramel powder or something like that? Does that even exist? It’s got a sharp brown sugar taste that hits first and then a sweet something like caramel finish, with just a hint of something kind of buttery in the middle, but it’s a little harsh at first and very dry throughout. Not smooth. This can definitely work really well as a dark sweet note ingredient down around 0.5% to 1%, but I don’t know why you’d try to use it as caramel flavor if you actually want it to taste like caramel, unless you’re mixing it with a lot of cream to smooth it out, and even then there are almost always going to be better options.

Once I finish remaking my Apple Butter Cookie recipe, I might not have a favorite recipe that uses FA Caramel. But I probably will, because it appears in so many recipes I already plan to try: Jersey Caramel, Two-Horned Pterodactyl, Drops of Jupiter, Butterscotch Reserve, Even Nick Can Make Custard 2, and So-Ho-Ho-Ho. And they all look so good.

Adding three more:

[Black Vanilla Silk](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/236422#black_vanilla_silk_by_davidn2kl). Described as licorice, coconut, and strawberry coated in caramel vanilla. Fascinating. **TASK 4**

[Caramilked](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/173792#caramilked_by_diydownunderpippa). That looks pretty freakin yummy **TASK 5**

[The Gentleman](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/201080#the_gentleman_by_nivsh). Someone made his own RY4. WIth blackjack, and hookers. **TASK 6**

**Cardamom**

I need it for two favorites, [Arab Mom’s Butter Cookie](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/197505#arab_mom_s_butter_cookie_by_nowar) and [Mujak Pepparakaka](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/206522#mjuk_pepparkaka_by_wallebiela).

I’ll also try this [Pancardamom ‘N Pyrup](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/223423#pancardamom_n_pyrup_by_eyemsam). Cardamom-spiced pan fried cake, with a maple pear syrup. **TASK 7**

**Catalan Cream**

So this is supposed to be something like a crème brulee, but more milky, and infused with vanilla, lemon, orange, and cinnamon. I’ve enjoyed it in some of the recipes I’ve tried and commended for finding great uses for a difficult ingredient because I definitely consider this to be a difficult ingredient. It has a mildly creamy finish but does not have any of the custardy richness it’s supposed to have. It leads with a spicy vanilla, dry cinnamon, and light hints of citrus, has some bittersweet brown sugar flavor underneath that, but none of the torched sugar crust of a real crème brulee. People have described the citrus as lemon and orange but I don’t get a discreet lemon or orange, more of a generic citrus that leans toward lemon. It’s a little harsh to vape solo on top but sort of soothes itself in the finish. That brown sugar tastes just a little chemically and weird. So kudos to those who’ve made it work, I’ll mix your recipes with it but there’s little chance of me reaching for this flavor for my own creations.  

Although the recipes I’ve tried in the past were great, they weren’t all-time favorites that I’m attached to.

But, maybe one of these will be.

[New York Groove](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/234722#new_york_groove_by_davidn2kl). Interesting mix of flavors, described as a moist Pink Lady Apple Muffin drizzled with butterscotch and bits of cookie crisp. **TASK 8**

[Banana Slam](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/162422#banana_slam_by_bananaslamma) by BananaSlamma. What does a self-titled album taste like? **TASK 9**

[Golden Smog](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/268399#golden_smog_by_lynda_marie). “A sweet sugar cream pie with candied pecans in a light pie crust” appeals to me. I’m going to use JF Cookie instead of FA, and sub FW Sweetener for the CAP Super Sweet because 0.75% CAP SS is a bit much for me, especially in recipe that’s not pure candy. **TASK 10**

[Spook-Bury Cake](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/290966#spook_bury_cake_by_lynda_marie) by the same mixer, again with the WF Sugar Pie and FA Catalan Cream, this time with blackberries instead of pecans. **TASK 11**

[GF Yourself](https://www.bullcityflavors.com/gf-yourself-by-sthrnmixer/). Because Steve said so. **TASK 11.5**

**Ceylon Cinnamon**

Mostly just a dry, very thin, top-heavy plain bakery cinnamon. I can’t remember who said it first, but there’s a little something off there and someone described it as a savory curry note, and ever since then I’ve been unable to taste this standalone without thinking of curry. Like not enough curry that it’s actually there and you can clearly taste it, but like they extracted the cinnamon from a curry but couldn’t quite get all of the curry out of the cinnamon Tastes like it would work well for a place where you must want a little real cinnamon on top and don’t want any depth to it.

I feel like my cinnamon needs are pretty well covered by quite a few other flavors, but there’s nothing so wrong with it that I wouldn’t keep it if it were used in an irresistible recipe. I saw some really good-looking recipes, but none that I just couldn’t pass up. **TRASH 1**

**Cheesecake Olympic**

I think it’s delicious, but it is not a cheesecake. I don’t know what it is. It’s a very creamy, very sweet, silky smooth, dairy based... something. With a hint of coconut.  It doesn’t taste cheesy at all, it tastes almost like lightly cotton-candy flavored yogurt. Which is totally a thing, my kid wanted some in a tube and I bought it for him and tried it. It was pretty good if you like cotton candy, and this tastes similar, but with a bit of coconut. No kind of cheesecake crust at all, doesn’t have anything really making it taste like it’s been baked, not especially cheesy. I might use it to sweeten a cheesecake? IDK. I’m not really sure what to do with it, but it’s yummy to me. As soon as I tried it, I had a feeling people would use it in amazing ways.

I can hardly wanted to try this [M A L T E D](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/306466#m_a_l_t_e_d_by_sensory_overload) recipe for malted vanilla milkshake - it looks stupendous. **TASK 12**

[Death By Cream](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/259990#death_by_cream_by_sorteal) looks pretty good, too - if you just want to vape vanilla cream. Which, I think I do. **TASK 13**

**Cherry**

LOL Nope. Lots of new vinyl shower curtain taste, doesn’t rise to the level of what’s even vapeable as far as I’m concerned. **TRASH 2**

**Cherry Juice Sweet**

Well, it doesn’t taste like a new vinyl shower curtain, so it has that going for it at least. But it does taste pretty weird to me. I get real cherry juice, but not as tart/bitter as real cherry juice but an identifiable flavor, but also a slight perfumy off note that tastes a little like baby shit. I don’t mean actual poop, I mean like baby powder, baby lotion, baby oil. Whatever the hell that “baby” scent is. And also an underlying, faint kind of cinnamony spice. It seems like a small amount of it could really do something interesting in a mix, but it would need to be a very small amount, because even 0.75% is pretty gnarly. **TRASH 3**  

**Chestnut**

I still haven’t opened this one. I’ll give it a try at 2%. **TASK 14**

**Chocolate**

Very fake chocolate. Tastes like carob, which is similar enough to chocolate that people have tried to use it as a chocolate substitute, but it really tastes more like nutty cardboard than chocolate. Maybe midway between cardboard and chocolate. It’s terrible. **TRASH 4**

**Chocolate Glazed Doughnut**

Waxy chocolate on puked up yeast frybread. How the hell do you put out a chocolate-glazed donut flavor so much later than Capella and not first make sure that it’s not better than Capella’s. That doesn’t even make any sense. It does the waxy chocolate glaze pretty well, just sitting right on top where it belongs, but what’s underneath is a little gross. It’s definitely a yeast-risen donut and part of the problem is that it’s too aggressively yeasty. The other part is that it tastes like it was already partially digested, it has some buttery richness but it’s marred by stomach acid. **TRASH 5**

**Cider Apple**

Same weird baby product off-note as Cherry Juice. Same underlying kind of cinnamony spice, the only difference is the middle is a soft apple vs a tart cherry. I’ll stick to WF Apple Cider and FLV Apple Cider for my apple cider needs. **TRASH 6**

**Citrus Mix**

It’s neat because you can taste all of the individual citruses in there - grapefruit, lemon, and orange. It’s grapefruit forward, enough that I’d call it a grapefruit flavor. The others more in the back, tastes very fresh and though it could be juicier, it’s not dry. It’s thin-tasting but without being harsh. I like it, but I’ll be ok without it. **TRASH 7**
  
**Clove**

Strong clear clove, sweet warm spice, but a little thin and sour in a way it shouldn’t be. This is not really a problem, I’ve tried a few recipes that use FA Clove in the past and I think [Mjuk Pepparkaka](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/206522#mjuk_pepparkaka_by_wallebiela) alone is worth picking up FA Clove for.

In search of another reason to keep it, I’ll try [Jolly Old Pipe](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/167023#jolly_old_pipe_by_chemicalburnvictim), too. **TASK 15**

**Cocoa**

Pretty authentic to plain dry cocoa, bitter and very dry, powdery, pretty unpleasant to vape standalone but does taste like cocoa powder. Unfortunately, it’s such a terrible coil gunker that it starts to give off a burnt taste of old cotton after vaping it for just a short time. I don’t even think I hit 5ml at 1% before my wicks were starting to taste crispy and ashy. Also, my bottle of the stuff has some sediment in it and not all of it would shake back into solution. Makes me wonder whether it’s even a good idea to vape FA Cocoa at all. **TRASH 8**

**Coconut**

It’s realistic, natural, not suntan oily, but a little flat and dull. It has some body to it, so it’s not thin, but it’s nothing like the thickness and riches of so many other coconuts. It’s also a little dry, while lacking the condensed flavor of dry coconut flakes.  More like coconut meat. Tastes like it badly needs some help from another coconut flavor or needs to be used to help another, more artificial coconut flavor taste more like the real thing.

I need it for: Leche De Coco, Mango Colada, IYSLPC, and Galadriel’s Light.

I already plan to try: Hula, Coconut Cheesecake, Elder Berry, Graham Toff Tarkin, and Stuck on An Island.

Also want to mix: [Bounty](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/70669#bounty_abuela_de_coco_by_herrhut) - a coconut-flavored cigar. **TASK 16**

[Classic reference piece](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/257290#classic_reference_piece_by_chumbles). It looks like a virgin strawberry pina colada. **TASK 17**

[Monkey Juice](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/299739#monkey_juice_by_jbitts), it’s called a banana coconut custard and while I have some doubt about how custardy it really is, I don’t doubt it’s delicious. **TASK 18**

**Cocoon**

Dumb name for what is supposed to taste like a caramel apple; “Our interpretation of the moment when the warm embrace of the caramel melds with the sweetness of the apple, another amazing fairground flavour,” is what FA says about it.  I’d love a good sweet sticky caramel apple flavor so I was excited to try this one, but what I got wasn’t what I expected. Rather than tasting like a caramel-coated apple, it tastes more like a caramelized apple. Like someone made an apple pie or apple crumble but forgot the cinnamon, and this is mostly that cooked un-spiced apple from it, with just a little of the pastry. There’s a bit of dry pastry note in the finish. It’s sweet but not sweet and sticky like caramel coating or apple juice sweet, it’s more of a dry powdered sugary sweetness. The entire thing is vapes really dry overall. I could see this playing an important role in a apple pie, apple crumble, or apple-topped funnel cake mix or something like that, but it sure ain’t no caramel apple.

I didn’t see a recipe I needed to make that uses it, and I prefer PUR Country Apple for unspiced cooked apple. **TRASH 9**

**Cola**

It tastes like flat store-brand cola. It’s a little thin, not very concentrated for FA, not very sweet, and not very saturated at any concentration, but it doesn’t have any glaring off-notes. A little too citrusy, but probably not to such a degree that it would be a big problem in a mix.

I already plan to mix [BlackBeard//Broken](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/270149#blackbeard_broken_by_wolfwheeler). Might as well add [All Might//Broken](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/268033#all_might_broken_by_wolfwheeler) (rocket pop & frozen cola) while I’m at it. **TASK 19**

**Cookie Premium**

Super Buttery! Lovely light vanilla, thick doughy cookie with lots of butter, grainy texture. There’s something slightly sour about it that throws me off a little, like there might be some butyric acid but not enough to get vomity on me, just a little sour. It’s probably the kind of ick that gets disappeared in a mix, and this is overall a really solid extra buttery biscuit type cookie. It’s probably the answer for people who want to vape biscuit and find INW and even JF biscuit flavors to be too coconutty. Doughy but not as raw doughy as SSA Shortbread Biscuit. A bit over-cooked but not as overcooked as WF Shortbread Cookie.

Already plan to mix [Time Machine Cookie](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/247709#time_machine_cookie_by_davidn2kl) and the similar (but with Apple Filling and caramel) [Cinnamon Dusted Caramel Apple Dainty](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/266639#cinnamon_dusted_caramel_apple_dainty_by_kuri_santou).

Emily’s [stb cookie](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/262401#stb_cookie_by_mlnikon) looks delightful. How has that been up for over a year with no reviews? **TASK 20**

So does her new [Strict Countries](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/309426#strict_countries_by_mlnikon) vanilla sandwich cookie recipe. **TASK 21**

**Corn**

Very authentic, tastes just like canned sweet corn. I can’t find anything wrong with this flavor, other than you have to really want to vape CORN, and the fact that it really lingers in your atomizer.

[Full Count](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/225429#full_count_by_wolfwheeler) is already on to-mix list. So is [Old Man Cobb](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/286197#old_man_cobb_by_spdrjrslm), basically because I’m apparently a baby if I don’t mix it.

I’ll add [Cinna Crunchies Cereal Drizzle](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/181762#cinnana_crunchies_cereal_drizzle_toasted_remix_by_humanpuck) because that looks super tasty and is inspired by Toasted, a recipe I love. **TASK 22**

**Croissant**

 Tastes like you sprayed a pastry with a ton of lemon pledge. It’s vile. **TRASH 10**

**Cuban Supreme**

This is actually pretty terrible. By itself, it tastes like a cigar and a sweet bell pepper had an abominable baby.

The bell pepper steeps out/is covered by other flavors after two to three weeks in [The Creamy Cuban](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/19044#the_creamy_cuban_by_fear) (not a super favorite recipe, but a good one) and my [Two Kentuckies](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/90550#two_kentuckies_by_id10_t) recipe, but I’m already working on replacing it in a remix of Two Kentuckies (I think a combination of FLV Cured and Connecticut Shade will fix it, just have to find the right balance). So Cuban Supreme is on its way out, but I plan to mix the original Two Kentuckies first to help think about how to best tackle that remix project.

While I’ve still got Cuban Supreme hanging around, I’ll also try this [Touch of Cherry](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/297105#a_touch_of_cherry_by_ozzy) “cherry cigar with emphasis on the cigar” recipe. If I love it, I might keep Cuban Supreme longer, or I might try to see if FLV Cured will work in that one as well. **TASK 23**

**Cucumber**

Possibly suffers from being a little too authentic. Very green. Skin-on fresh cucumber, pushing up to but not quite crossing over into astringent, comes across clean and a little juicy. Crisp. Comparatively authentic vs other cucumbers but a little sweetness (mostly from VG) makes it come across a little like watermelon rind. A bit on the thin side. 3% just a touch lemony - like FA signed it, I would keep it a 2.5% or lower. 1% is enough to add some fresh juiciness to a mix with just a little authentic cucumber top note.

I really enjoyed [Yusuke](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/200546#yusuke_by_wolfwheeler), a lemonade with cucumber and kiwi accents, but not enough for it to be my only reason to keep FA Cucumber. And I didn’t see anything else that uses it that I badly wanted to mix. **TRASH 11**

**Custard**

A lemon cream flavor, really. Very lemony, and not quite as thick as you probably want a custard to be. It does fill out some as it steeps, but it still is more of a thick cream than what I expect from a custard. The lemon is already a softer lemon zest, and fades enough that you can cover it with another fruit, but I don’t think it’s going to work for a non-fruit custard or cream mix. Has a light touch of vanilla that comes out a bit more as it steeps but can also be covered up. Smooth flavor.

I already plan to try Banana Slam that uses it, and even though it has a ton of ingredients and pulling all those out is going to be annoying, this new [R.I.P. NomeL](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/312387#r_i_p_nomel_by_nemesisvaper83) lemon cream recipe looks it like might be worth the work. **TASK 24**

**Custard Extra 1**

It’s just butyric enough to ruin an otherwise good milky pudding-like vanilla custard. Like just go ahead and make instant pudding with milk that’s about three days past the sell-by date, what could go wrong? Vomit, a hint of vomit is what goes wrong. Vomit is the extra in Custard Extra 1.

Maybe with a longer steep FA Custard Extra 1 works out. Probably it does, just like CAP Vanilla Custard V2 gets a lot better after a steep. Minus the vomit taste, it’s a light, airy, custard, more of a Jello Instant pudding situation. Heavy on the dairy, not really any butter to speak of, a touch of barely there medium range vanilla.

I looked at all the recipes on All The Flavors and while they otherwise looked pretty good, I could not imagine that they wouldn’t be better with some other ingredient taking the place of FA Custard Extra 1. **TRASH 12**  

**Custard Extra 2**

Not really unpleasant, but very weird.  If it weren’t for the very sweet dark sweetness in there, like a dark brown sugar or almost molasses, I would swear I’m vaping creamed corn. Very rich and creamy, with a very distinct corn flavor and just a bit of vanilla. Why is there corn in the custard? No freaking clue. Why is there brown sugar in the creamed corn? Can’t answer that either. All I can say is that someone will find a use for this that plays into the corn note rather than trying to cover it up, and that will be the best use for it. Otherwise, this is just weird and pretty bad for something called “Custard.”  Corn is the extra in Custard Extra 2. **TRASH 13**

**Custard Premium**

Extremely buttery but not oily like CAP VCV1. Very light egg, nice bright but very light vanilla that’s right on top throughout, and a smooth, soft mouthfeel. There’s really nothing missing, but the butter might be too much and maybe you want to use it lower and bring in another custard, vanilla, or cream flavor that isn’t so buttery balance it out. It’s buttery enough I think you could use it instead of a butter flavor in a bakery or anywhere you want butter + maybe vanilla.

You’re outside your mind if you think I’m getting rid of FA Custard Premium. The recipes I need and want it for are too many to list. Here are three more not previously listed elsewhere in “Getting Rid of Most of My Flavors” that I’m going to try:

[Rudolph On Acid](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/131873#rudolph_on_acid_by_folkart). Really just a strawberry cream, but it looks like a good one. **TASK 25**

[Joker Reloaded](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/156147#joker_reloaded_by_nachef) I love key lime pie! **TASK 26**

[Skip around the Guava](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/316332#skip_around_the_guava_by_jbitts). Not sure how these flavors will work together, but I like guava and I like custard (and coconut and cactus) so we’ll see.  **TASK 27**

**Dark Bean**

That’s just nas-tee. I don’t know how anyone vapes any amount of this ever. It tastes like you put espresso coffee grounds, burnt popcorn that had been sprayed by a skunk, and dirt in a drip coffee maker, brewed it, and then added a couple of sugar packets to that. It wasn’t enough to change my cotton and coils, I had to wash my RDA after trying a little of a 0.25% sample. **TRASH 14**

New Flavor Count: 2,473
