# CAPELLA

**Green Apple Hard Candy**

Update. I mixed [Camp Tigerclaw](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/127046#camp_tigerclaw_by_concreteriver) again and while I’m not taking it off the list of favorite recipes or making it no longer my go-to green apple recipe to mix just yet, I can’t help thinking that this can’t be the best possible use of CAP Green Apple Hard Candy. Looking for something a little smoother, without that hint of coconutty off note from the ton of FLV Sour Apple in there, without relying so much on such a large amount of CAP Super Sweet.

This [Green Apple Candy](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/198521#green_apple_candy_by_rug_ly) uses less CAP GAHC and FLV Sour Apple, augments them with a little INW Anton Apple, and sweetens with CAP Sweet Candy. Might be what I’m looking for. **TASK 1**

I’ll also try this [Azul](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/156268#azul_by_lajuanapipa) blue raspberry recipe that uses just a touch of it. I have trouble believing that 0.25% GAHC makes much difference there, but the rest of the recipe looks good. **TASK 2**

**Harvest Berry**

Update. I said I was going to give CAP Harvest Berry one more recipe to justify its place among my remaining flavor. The recipe I picked turned out to not be bad - very sweet, juicy and full melon mix with some dark berry background - but I got just a bit of a soapy, plasticky off-note from it, just enough to distract from all the goodness slightly. **TRASH 1**

**Hibiscus**

Update. This one was never in danger of being tossed out, but I wanted to find something else to do with it besides [Pank Milk](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/184392#pank_milk_by_id10_t) **TASK 3** and [Blue Frost Revisited](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/54784#blue_frost_revisited_by_apexified) **TASK 4**.  

I tried three recipes and found one new favorite, [Malonee](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/283658). It’s a very nice sweet blend of melons (cantaloupe and watermelon primarily, some honeydew in the back) with a hint of tropical floral from the high concentration of Hibiscus. CAP Hibiscus is usually “hidden” in mixes at around 1% for the sticky sweet syrupy but not artificial sweet taste it lends. But it sticks out here just a bit. I’m not complaining. I like it very much. I feel like a designated driver at a pool party where the pool is near a fragrant tropical flower garden with this thing. When the breeze blows just right, you can smell them, and they’re lovely. This is not a boldly-flavored mix. It’s relaxing, great for “sipping” - although when I mix it again - and I will - I’ll probably drop the Super Sweet down to 0.25% from 0.5% and make it even more all-day-vapable. It’s supposed to be sweet but not candy sweet and I think it will get closer to the mark that way. **TASK 5**

# FLAVOUR ART

**New York Cheesecake**

Who is this flavor playin with? It’s not gross at all, actually pretty tasty, but it’s a shit cheesecake, just very underwhelming. Not really cheesy, not rich and thick, mostly just a bright vanilla with a bit of sweet dairy cream that’s fairly light and thin, with a crust note behind it that tastes undercooked, without butteriness. Basically like spreading some vanilla frosting on a very blonde, unspiced graham cracker. I guess you could use it to build a cheesecake, but you’re going to want some actual cream cheese and more crust, both, just more everything. It doesn’t seem to have much to offer. Apparently some people also get strawberries from this? But I do not get even a fruity sweetness.  

I would not be keeping it if it weren’t for this [Pistachio Lime Cannoli](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/163737#pistachio_lime_cannoli_by_r2me2) I want to try. Love the combination of pistachio and lime in general. **TASK 6**

**Nonna’s Cake**

Lemon- and licorice-flavored cake. Really thick after a steep, some cakey texture and some nice vanilla, but just covered in anise to the point of having a licorice aftertaste, and not lacking in lemon either. It’s really not a bad-tasting thing, but you have to want a lemon- and licorice-flavored cake. There’s no covering that anise and probably little hope of covering the lemon, either. **TRASH 2**

**Nut Mix**

The first time I tasted this, I couldn’t really pick out any particular nuts. I really had to slow down and concentrate on what I was tasting to get any individual nuts from it. At first, it just tasted like a generic nutty flavor in two parts. The first part is sharp and almost bitter, that “nut skin” note, followed by a sweeter, creamier but still nutty finish, with a lot of volume. People say it’s a mix of hazelnut and walnut and the sharpness does sort of resemble a raw hazelnut. There’s some almond in there too, but I was not getting that as a separate thing until I exhaled very slowly, and then yes, it’s in there, right between the sharper start and the sweeter finish, that’s a bit of almond peeking out in there. The sweeter, almost creamy finish is a little more like a roasted hazelnut, because of the sweeter, mellower flavor that hazelnuts have when they’re roasted, but aside from that it’s quite a bit more raw than roasty. I did not know where the walnut was going in until I tried FA Walnut, and then yes, there’s some walnut in there. It basically tastes like FA Walnut, FA Almond, and FA Hazel Grove all mixed together. It does not taste like a peanut at all, that distinctive peanut flavor just is not there. The sweeter creamier nut finish tastes like it could easily be covered up in a mix, the top part tastes like it could steamroll others, so it seems like it could be hard to balance right.

It’s not bad, but there’s nothing I want to mix that uses it. **TRASH 3**

**Oak Wood**

The most woody oak that doesn’t have much else going on. Clean, drier oak top note. Like smelling a stack of fresh oak firewood. Oddly creamy base, but not coconut cream like TFA Red Oak and not dairy cream either, more like how you might describe a port wine or sherry as creamy. Not sweet, which is probably good for adding barrel-aged flavor to things like boozes and tobaccos. But I would not use it for a bourbon because that calls for a charred oak barrel and there’s no char here. No smoke, no pine or cedar or any other type of wood, nothing like that.

Oak Wood is in one of my favorite recipes, [Apricaught Me Slippin’](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/54094#apricaught_me_slippin_by_chemicalburnvictim) and three or four more I’ve planned to try.

I’ll add one more, [barbossa](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/292032#barbossa_mwc_by_vapenxx). I dunno whether a rum and coke float tobacco recipe is even a good idea, but it looks interesting enough that I want to find out. **TASK 7**

**Oba Oba**

Mild vanilla candy flavor. I think it was Jen Jarvis who said it tastes like “sucking on an M&M” - like the candy shell around the M&M, not the chocolate inside. I think that’s as good a description as any. It’s a soft flavor but it has deep, sugary sweet body to it, very relaxing to just vape standalone. Not exactly a marshmallow flavor, but sort of in that vein. Not exactly vanilla cream soda either, but also along that line. FA says it has “has a light, fruity taste, something similar to a mixture of  citrus and vanilla. Some even think it tastes like candy and eggnog.” Which is bizarre since I don’t get any citrus from it - it’s like the only thing FA didn’t put lemon in. Nor any eggnog spice or eggnog taste. Freaking FA, weird. But it’s extremely pleasant and tastes like you could put 1% of it just about anywhere.

I’m planning to create and share a vanilla-lime candy recipe that will almost definitely use it.

Meanwhile, it’s in two of my most favorite recipes of all time [Giant Swan](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/247312#giant_swan_by_concreteriver), and [Xmas Tree Cakes](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/209954#xmas_tree_cakes_by_eyemsam) **TASK 8** and a few things I’ve planned to mix, including one I’ll probably find time to shake up today.

I’m nervous about all that cherry, but I have to try [Big Dilly](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/307861#big_dilly_by_eyemsam) just in case that really tastes like the real thing - soft serve vanilla ice cream dipped in cherry-flavored Magic Shell. **TASK 9**

**Orange**

Not sweet. Pretty harsh. Natural rather than candy. Bland and has no body, but also no zesty top notes to make up for the lack of body. Dull and boring, nowhere near as vibrant as fresh orange juice, maybe old orange juice that’s separated and all pulp is at the bottom and you didn’t shake it and this is just the flavor of the watery top half. Maybe good down low for a hint of orange or some realism to a less realistic orange, but definitely not something I plan to use as a main orange flavor.

I’ll reluctantly keep it at least long enough to try [In A Godda Colada](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/237510#in_a_godda_colada_by_slushy) because I love In a Godda Da Vida and the idea of adding coconut to it interests me. **TASK 10**

**Pandoro**

All the butter! Also a fair amount of lemon and a touch of vanilla, with a thick as fuck sweet pound-cake and slightly bready cakey body, but especially butter. Super smooth and mouth-coatingly rich. Mixing around the lemon seems difficult because it’s pretty pervasive, I’d just lean into it and add more lemon for a lemon pound cake or similar flavor. Does need a bit of steep - like two weeks - to have the cakey body come forward more beyond the butter and lemon.

This is a perfectly fine lemon butter cake flavor, but there’s just not anything I need or want to make with it. **TRASH 4**

**Papaya**

At 2%, it tastes like a sugary-sweet cross between cantaloupe, mango, pineapple, and fig, just like a papaya does. It’s cantaloupe-y enough that it makes a really neat addition to a cantaloupe vape, it ripens and sweetens cantaloupes and makes them a lot more interesting. It starts to get a little soapy and have some issues with dryness and unpleasant floral perfume at 3%, but I know from working with it that 1 to 2% is an effective dose in a recipe with other fruit flavors. Very little is needed to have a fairly authentic-tasting papaya-forward mix, but it’s not as full-bodied and saturated as others. This can be a good thing if you need room for other fruits: Other options like TFA Papaya can be bullies.. It’s missing the bit of creaminess and richness of a perfectly ripened papaya. It’s not juicy either, but it’s not thin. It has some pulpy flesh body to it and starts to get a little more candy-ish at higher concentrations, like a gummy candy.  It’s a bit funky but less funky than others, which can be a good thing. It’s un-funked enough to work in a candy. It is not harsh whatsoever, it’s very smooth, seems like it might even be used to smooth out other flavors.  It also has a tiny bit of a very interesting sort of warm spice note t, that I can't quite put a name on, but only very little and only at the very end of the exhale, at 2% but not at 1%.

I’ve used it in a recipe [1-2-3 YachtCocaineProstitutes](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/146571#1_2_3_yachtcocaineprostitutes_by_id10_t) that I should mix again and think about improving it. **TASK 11**

**Papaya Indian Special**

I will have to try this higher. I was conservative with the concentration because Papaya flavors for whatever reason tend to run a little strong. Sampling it at 1.5%, this is soft, like La Croix papaya. What’s there is pleasant enough and certainly does taste like papaya, but if the intensity of it doesn’t ramp up with higher amounts, there are better options. But is probably an improvement over the original FA Papaya, in that it has a similar flavor but is juicier. Bottom line, needs more testing. I’ll mix another sample at 3%. **TASK 12**

**Passion Fruit**

I don’t know what they put in this thing, but I can hardly vape it at all. It hurts. I know whatever it is, it doesn’t affect everyone the same way, and I’m kind of jealous of those who can and do enjoy it, because underneath the oppressive harshness, it’s a pretty good little passionfruit. It mostly tastes like a white peach, especially FA White Peach, with that white peach sweetness and body, but also some citrus tartness and a fair amount of tropical funky goodness. Whatever that thing is that makes a passion fruit taste like  passion fruit, it’s solidly in there. It’s not especially juicy, but it’s not not-juicy either. If I could vape it, I might punch up the tartness and juiciness with a little bit of juicier lemon flavor.  

No more FA Throat Razors for me. **TRASH 5**

**Pazzo Jack**

The ad copy says “Jack is a bold and sweet strawberry flavor that will put you in mind of your Grandmother’s candy dish with a sweet crunchy outside and gooey center. It will satisfy your sweet tooth all day long” I found that to be about four-fifths true. If you crank it up to 6% it is indeed very bold, extremely sweet, and it’s the sweet crunchy outside of those strawberry hard candies all day long. However, I’m not finding any of the gooey center here. In fact, the whole thing feels a little dry, but not in quite the same way as a lot of other flavors feel dry. This is like, so sweet it dries your mouth out. Like eating sugar. Also that gooey center tastes a little different and although this is very bold and saturated flavor, it doesn’t have a lot of complexity to it, it’s just that one sweet candy strawberry note turned up really loud. It would be better if it actually did have a gooey center. Lingering strawberry candy flavor and a little bit of sugar lips sensation.  

I’ll try two simple strawberry candy recipes that use it, [Dead Inside](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/93341#dead_inside_by_digitaldrops) combines it with a little FA Forest Fruit, a little TFA Strawberry, and some CAP Super Sweet. **TASK 13**

[Jackoff](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/212243#jackoff_by_danielthevapeman) is just two ingredients, Pazzo Jack and INW Shisha Strawberry. **TASK 14**

**Pazzo Burlone (Joker)**

I don’t remember ever having tried this cannoli shell flavor. I’ll do a sample at 4%. **TASK 15**

And, while I have it out, [Kenshin Himura](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/205172#kenshin_himura_by_wolfwheeler) “cannoli cream with peach, matcha, and crushed shell pieces.” Very interesting. **TASK 16**

**Peach**

Just a plain but more natural than candy peach flavor, nothing really noteworthy about it, a little dry or at least not juicy, and a little thin and one-dimensional. I do get a bit of throat hit off this one, as is common with peaches. Nothing I’ve tried that used this before was something I feel the need to make again, and nothing new looks like something I couldn’t do without. **TRASH 6**

**Pear**

This is the one pear flavor that just about everyone should have, even if you never want to vape a pear-flavored juice. It’s not the greatest pear, but it’s very good at adding some sweetness and some of that sought-after mouthwatering juicy quality to a fruit mix. Not quite as much juiciness as INW Cactus or TFA Honeydew, not even as much as INW Prickly Pear IMO, but still a significant amount of that juicy, refreshing quality, as well as some lingering natural-tasting sweetness. And FA Pear’s softer pear taste has a way of hiding in a boldly flavored mix at around 1% to 2%, without hiding the juiciness and sweetness. Besides being juicy and sweet, FA Pear by itself is bright and mostly tastes like natural pear, though a little light and lacking the body. More like straight up pear juice. I pushed it up to 4% before it started to get a little floral on me, and it still wasn’t a bold pear flavor.

I need it for some of my own recipes, such as Impropapiety. Some favorite recipes by others, such as [Cantrips](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/42467#cantrips_by_shyndo) **TASK 17**, [Sweet Summer Chilled](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/60351#sweet_summer_chilled_by_apexified) **TASK 18**, All Day, and Yoda Soda. And at least 8 recipes I’ve already listed to try. Here’s even more:

[Dragonscales](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/106328#dragonscales_by_silky) Dragonfruit with raspberry and honeysuckle accents. **TASK 19**

[Pear Belly](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/288775#pear_belly_by_spdrjrslm) supposedly a fancy pear jelly bean. The notes specially say “don’t fear the anise” (it has SSA Anise at 0.5%) so I’m going to rely on my love for WF Cotton Candy Jelly Bean to help me overcome that. **TASK 20**

**Peppermint (Mild Winter)**

Pretty basic, solid Starlight Mint/Candy Cane type of peppermint. Sweet, but probably should be even sweeter for a candy-tasting peppermint. Not overly icy but has that little bit of peppermint bite. Very lightly creamy-ish body, not thin.

I’m not impressed (I like my peppermints on the icier side) but not repulsed, either. Would be fine without it, if not for a couple of really interested recipes I’m keen to try.

[Gemingo](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/211025#gemingo_by_teezix). Mango, ginger, lemonade... peppermint? Ok, I’m curious. **TASK 21**

[Earthquake Weather](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/270961#earthquake_weather_1_2_3_snv_by_buriedalive). CAP Sweet Guava and peppermint? Guava and peppermint are two things I’ve never thought about combining before and I need to know what this tastes like. There’s also some FA Watermelon in there, but I’m sure that mostly hides behind the Guava. And PUR Super Sweet (I’ll sub in FW Sweetener because I don’t have that). **TASK 22**

 **Pina Colada Brazilian Special**

Not a bad-tasting pina colada at all. It’s very clearly pineapple, coconut, and rum. Bonus points for actually having a rum taste, several of the other pina colada flavors you can buy have no rum at all. But I do have a couple of issues with FA Pina Colada. One, it’s very heavily unbalanced in favor of the pineapple, two, it tastes thin, not thick and creamy. Like if you tried to make a pinacolada out of coconut water instead of coconut cream, this is what you’d get. You’d need to add a nice creamy coconut for this to be a decent pina colada.

It is a shame that I’m missing a couple of flavors I’d need to be able to mix [Peninsula Boys](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/256078#peninsula_boys_by_danielthevapeman), a pina colada with creams and tobaccos, a hit of meme, and splash of douche. I bet it’s pretty good.

I was just about to let it go when I remembered ConcreteRiver’s [Feint](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/38680#feint_by_concreteriver) and wondered whether I could make an updated Feint out of this. Can’t hurt to try.

Lunge V1 **TASK 23**

Co.| Flavor | %
---|---|----
FA | Pina Colada | 4
FLV | Red Burley | 1.5
TFA| Coconut Candy | 0.75
TFA | Brown Sugar | 0.25
FA | Black Fire| 0.5

**Pineapple**

Not to be confused with the next two flavors, FA’s newer pineapples. This is the old one. It’s fucking disgusting. **TRASH 7**

This was one of my earliest experiences with a truly horrible flavor, and still to this day one of the worst flavors I have ever tried, an abomination of almost biblical proportions. Tastes like rotten pineapple, green onions, and burnt tires.  

This flavor is so garbage they needed two new pineapple flavors to replace it.

**Pineapple Costa Rica**

Seems like a perfectly fine pineapple to me so far. 1% is a little soft but that was probably my bad for tasting such a diluted sample. It smelled strong in the bottle, though. It tastes like pineapple, it’s sweet, tart, a little juicy. It’s also a little bit funky, but so is a nice fully ripe pineapple.

[Flamingoes & Sunsets](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/296204#flamingos_sunsets_by_ninedimensions) is a pineapple, tangerine, and grapefruit recipe that looks terrific as long as all those citrusy things don’t rip my throat up. **TASK 24**

I have reason to be concerned because that same mixer has another otherwise delicious-looking Pineapple Costa Rica mix, [Nine’s Tropical Punch](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/269021#nine_s_tropical_punch_by_ninedimensions) that I know I will not be able to vape because of the FA Passionfruit/Throat Razors in there. But if 1.5% FA Costa Rica Pineapple is all it takes to make a Hawaiian Punch-type vape, it might be worth exploring as an alternative to the INW Pineapple in [Counter Punch](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/154364#counter_punch_by_id10_t). Then I got another idea. Back when I participated in the Mixer’s Club juice exchange, my favorite month was always February, which is when we had the theme “duets.” It involved mashing two recipes together into one. Not usually all the ingredients from each, but key parts that could harmonize together. I’m going to play duets again. A duet with punches.

Ike & Tina V1 **TASK 25**  

Co. | Flavor | %
---|---|----
FA | Apricot | 1.75
VT | Yellow Passion | 1.5
FA | Pineapple Costa Rica | 1.5
TFA | Smooth | 0.25
FW | Sweetener | 0.75
CAP | Sweet Guava | 2.5
INW | Cherries | 2
CAP | Sweet Tangerine | 2

Both recipes have FA Apricot, Nine’s at 2% and Counter at 1.5%. I’ll meet in the middle and try 1.75% for round one. Nine’s has FA Passion which I’m throwing away, but it also has VT Yellow Passion which is lovely at 1.5%. I’ll copy that. Nine’s has FA Pineapple Costa Rica at 1.5% and I’ll copy that over, leaving out the INW Pineapple used in Counter. Both recipes use TFA Smooth 0.25% and while I’d usually wait to see what it tastes like without it before adding that, I’ll make an exception this time because I’m sure I’m going to want that blendy-blendy plus mouthfeel. Nine’s uses PUR Super Sweet which I don’t have at 0.3% and Counter has FW Sweetener at 1%. Since I don’t know the difference between those two and I have an enormous bottle of FW Sweetener, I’ll just go with that, but drop it down a hair. Both recipes have CAP Sweet Guava, which, honestly, how do you make a tropical punch without it? Nine’s at 2.75% and Counter at 2.5%. A negligible difference, I’ll err on the side of using less of my precious CAP Sweet Guava for this silliness.  Finally, Nine’s has CAP Sweet Tangerine at 4% and Counter has INW Cherries at 4% (and CAP Yellow Peach at 1.5%). Tangerine and cherries, extremely different things, that’s how you know these are two very different recipes despite the similarities. I’m going to ditch the Yellow Peach (I think VT Yellow Passion has the Yellow part covered) but really try to make these disparate recipes sing together by using both Tangerine and Cherries at half-strength.  

**Pineapple Kenya**

IMO this is the less good of the two new FA Pineapples. Not that it’s useless or bad, it’s softer and more “plain” or flat tasting. It’s not as tart, it’s not as sweet, it’s not as deep and flavorful, it’s not as complex, and it’s not juicy at all like the other one is, though I wouldn’t call it especially dry, either. I think this one is very skippable.

I’d toss it, but [Charizard](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/249450#charizard_red_yellow_orange_fruit_blend_by_danielthevapeman) uses it and is already on the to-do list.

Mindfloodz’s [Lava Dam](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/252173#lava_dam_by_mindfloodz) is the only other FA Pineapple Kenyan recipe on ATF at the moment. It is not going on my list. It doesn’t look bad, but it looks a bit forced. He’s challenged himself to make a Lava Flow style recipe using only new FA flavors and while that kind of thing really can be a fun challenge and a good learning experience, it rarely yields the best possible results. I’ve never had Lava Flow but as I can see from the various clones and remixes, it’s a strawberry, coconut, pineapple.mix. So, like a virgin strawberry pina colada type of thing. I can do that.

Dam Volcano Remix V1 **TASK 26**

Co. | Flavor | %
---|---|----
FA | Pina Colada Brazilian| 1.5
FA | Pineapple Kenyan | 1.5
FA | Strawberry Green | 1.5
CAP | Super Sweet | 0.5
WF | Coconut Custard | 3

The first four elements are taken directly from Lava Dam. The parts of Lava Dam that I don’t want are FA Cheesecake Olympic, FA Custard Extra 1, and FA Ice Cream Italian. But I can kinda see where he was going with that. It needs a cream element. Also from looking at it, I’m definitely going to want more coconut that FA Pina Colada provides. EZ-PZ, WF Coconut Custard. Should give it everything I want, without any nonsense. Remember this is just Version 1. It’ll probably need some tweaking.

**Pistachio**

Mostly roasted and somewhat woody nut flavor that fairly resembles a real pistachio, but has a little green – not in the way pistachios are supposed to be green but more like a slightly bitter “nut skin” – edge, like it’s a little raw or under-roasted. Has a nice kind of crispness or crunch to it at first, but not a lot of body or flavor to it after that initial nut. So, top heavy, and kind of a thin nut. Quite dry, but no more than is appropriate for a nut flavor. Tastes like it could be good at less than 2% for adding a kind of “nuts sprinkled on top” effect, but I wouldn’t count on it to be the only or even main pistachio in a pistachio-forward recipe, and trying to make it into something like a pistachio ice cream or pistachio pudding seems like a fool’s errand.

I feel like my pistachio needs are pretty well covered by TFA and FLV. I’m only keeping it - for now - because [Lucky Buttons Almond Custard](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/314814#lucky_buttons_almond_custard_by_echodub) **TASK 27** and [Bacco No. 7 - Pistachio](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/263381#bacco_no7_pistachio_by_saspi) **TASK 28** each use it at 0.5% and 0.75%, respectively, and each otherwise look terrific.

**Polar Blast**

The way this works is very similar to TFA Koolada, but different.  That’s because TFA Koolada is 10% WS-3 and Polar Blast is 7% WS-3 with 3% Menthyl lactate (Frescolat ML). The Menthyl lactate seems to alter most people's perception of the cooling effect a bit and mitigate the cardboardy, chemically off-notes associated with Koolada.

It’s in a few recipes I’m going to try, and I already know I need it for [The Back Nine](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/122659#the_back_nine_by_id10_t) - an Arnold Palmer spiked with Bourbon. **TASK 29**

Although I typically prefer WS-23, I need Polar Blast because WS-23 can get really weird with warm, boozy top notes, while Polar Blast hits different and is more of a back-end cooling that doesn’t interfere with booze. Essential if you want both cooling and booze, I think. But I also need WS-23 because Polar Blast can really do a number on creams, just like Koolada does. So, boozy recipes or recipes where I don’t want the top note interfered with, Polar Blast. Creamy recipes where I really need the cream to be rich and satisfying, WS-23. Hard to do booze, cream, and cooling in the same recipe. It is possible, but not fun to work through, and either the booze or the cream is going to suffer at least a little.

I also need it for my [Spicy Icy Chamoyada Mangonada](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/116249#spicy_icy_chamoyada_mangonada_by_id10_t), or since I’m going to try and improve that one, whatever version of that I’m on by the time I get this far down the to-do list. **TASK 30** The likely new version is mostly just improving on the mango note. Very likely it will still use both Polar Blast and WS-23 for a well-rounded top and bottom cooling.

**Pomegranate**

Thick and tart! Not quite as tart as real pom juice, but I’ll take it. It has some issues. It’s very lightly floral, has a touch of camphorous warmth to it, and has this little woody thing going on that can be a real problem, depending on what it’s mixed with and how much of it is used. I would keep it below 2% most of the time. Below 2%, very natural tasting, like the actual fruit.  I think despite its difficulties it is probably the best overall pom flavor I’ve tried (some are really bad).

This was used beautifully in [In a Godda Da Vida](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/26946#in_a_godda_da_vida_by_mlnikon) **TASK 31**

And in [Goddaron](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/95356), if I do say so myself. **TASK 32**

I also need it for [Crazberry Crack](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/32359#crazberry_crack_by_jbird). **TASK 33**

It’s in a couple of things I’ve already decided to try, and I just found four more irresistible.  

[Bishop V2](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/265163#bishop_v2_by_tugnil) - white peach, pomegranate, and green tea. **TASK 34**

[Granate](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/173312#granate_by_ruderudi) - pomegranate, raspberry, and coconut cream. **TASK 35**

[Hurricane](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/136614#hurricane_developed_by_developed). Before I go insane. **TASK 36**

[Straight Arsenic](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/212273#straight_arsenic_by_qszwax), because I’m really interested in how pomegranate, CAP Sweet Guava, and lemon-lime go together. **TASK 37**

**Potato Fried**

Tastes like slightly undercooked skin-on fries with zero salt. I think the undercooked thing and that slightly dirty skin note might be ok but it desperately needs salt to go with that realistic fried oil flavor. I don’t know of any way to get that kind of salty that it needs to not be yucky. **TRASH 8**

**Raspberry**

Another raspberry that’s more on the fresh, natural side. It’s a little floral, but those sharper slightly floral top notes are actually accurate for a raspberry - eat a fresh one and try to pick out that floral if you don’t believe me. Vibrant and bit tart, just enough. Kind of syrupy natural fruit sweetness, spot on for a raspberry. I don’t recommend going over 2% with it because those somewhat floral top notes get really out of hand, a little bitter and weird.. 2% is plenty, anyway. It’s a little dry, but not thin. Full-bodied or full flavored. The base is a little more jammy and dark, but overall it still tastes more like a real raspberry than most. Unfortunately, I don’t think FA Raspberry usually is a very good raspberry to use with creams. Creams bully the more natural short of middle here, and it makes the more floral edge stand out more. Great for mixing with other fruits, though. Worth noting that it vapes a little weirdly warm, but not as warm as some other raspberries.

It’s an ingredient in Giant Swan so I wouldn’t dream of getting rid of it. Also Crazberry Crack.

Three or four recipes I’ve planned to try already, and one of them is Blue Enigma. Might as well add [Blue Enigma II](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/309483#blue_enigma_ii_by_cam9535), an updated version, to the list. **TASK 38**

And another blue raspberry recipe, this one called [Blue Trinity](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/191138#blue_trinity_by_slushy) to complete with it. **TASK 39**

WIll also try [Quarantini](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/188162#quarantini_by_ruderudi), which is a cocktail recipe with FLV Juniper Gin, FW Blood Orange, and a couple of raspberries. **TASK 40**

And this [Simple](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/122364#simple_by_kopel) recipe that’s just FA Pear, FA Raspberry, and TFA Key Lime, because that sounds like a killer combo. **TASK 41**

**Raspberry Candy**

That is not good. It tastes like raspberry, put perfumey, with a weird, unpleasant potpourri off-note. **TRASH 9**

**Red Bean**

Extremely potent and guaranteed to linger in your atomizer until you ultrasonic cleanse it or soak it in rubbing alcohol. You will likely have to make a dilution because even 0.1% is too much for a mix, an overwhelming amount of red bean all up in your olfactory business. Pretty accurate flavor but with a weird green bell pepper-ish aftertaste. Mostly earthy bean skin with some mostly starchy, lightly creamy, slightly sweet body.

Not saying you can’t make something great out of it, but I’m done fucking around with this beast of a bean flavor. **TRASH 10**

**Red Wine**

Had to to order this one from Italy. Not worth it to me, but if you really, really want to vape red wine, it might be worth it to you. Very much a wine flavor Dry like a dry wine, not dry as in mouth-drying. Tannic. Think cabernet, not as sweet and fruity as a merlot. Slight sharp booziness. Rich like some wines are kinda rich, I guess the DAAP does that. Lingering oakyness. Tastes like it could go nail polishy if pushed too high but not any off notes at 1.5%, they nailed it. I personally rather vape a less realistic wine flavor but if this is what you want, if that’s truly what you want to do with your life, go to FlavourArt Italy and pick some up. I would have kept this for a good-looking recipe but seeing none, **TRASH 11**  

**Reggae Night**

Does not taste like weed, but I don’t find it especially unpleasant either. It’s kind of refreshing. Tastes like clear juniper upfront, very similar to gin, with sticky resinous and slightly citrusy pine behind it, and a bit of grass clippings in the background. Like being hired to mow the lawn at a Christmas tree farm. It also has a bit of sweetness to the finish, where that pine lingers. Some pine is obviously fine for this type of herb, but the juniper seems really out of place. The grass (actual lawn grass, not the “cash, grass, or ass” type of grass) can maybe be covered up in a mix. ButI can’t think of a reason to have it if you already have FA Gin or any gin flavor for the juniper and FLV Yakima Hops for that citrusy piney danky thing, or why you want juniper and pine together short of some weird Christmas-tree inspired cocktail or abstract tobacco concoction. **TRASH 12**

**Rhapsody**

I didn’t read FA’s description of this until after I tried it and then when I did I said What The Hell. They call it “A nice woody flavour with nutty and herbal notes, along with subtle floral and fruity undertones.” and use a picture of tobacco with it. I do not get nuts, herbs, florals, or tobacco. I get sweet tea with some vague fruit. Maybe I’m broken, maybe the flavor is, IDK.

The tea part is upfront and right on top, and it comes back around in the finish. It’s a little stronger, darker than I typically want sweet tea to be, like it someone used a few too many tea bags to make a pitcher of tea, but it’s pretty spot on otherwise and that too-much-teaness could be that the 4% I tried it at was pushing it a little high on the concentration. The fruitiness in the middle I can’t tell what if any specific fruit it’s supposed to be, but vagueness might equal versatility in this case - I could cover it with another fruit and make any kind of fruity sweet tea I want. Also seems like it would take well to cooling.

I’m going to try it at 2% plus 10% TFA Sweet Tea and see if it might work to bolster that weak ass but accurate flavor. **TASK 42**

**Rose**

Kinda nasty.  It’s rose that’s slightly sharp on top with some slightly bitter and tart leafy green citrusy stuff, a little harsh, but not quite grandma’s perfume, with a powerfully chalky, powdery sweetness and something rotten lurking in there. I don’t know what that rotten thing is, but it kinda tastes earthy like moldy old flowers and is nauseating. I would try to make this work if FLV Rose Essence didn’t exist, but it does. **TRASH 13**  

**Royal Orange**

Similar to FA Orange, but much improved. Pretty much a basic natural orange flavor. It’s not harsh at all, it’s actually rather smooth, it has some bright, tart and zesty notes.  Some sweetness but not a lot of it. It unfortunately vapes kind of warm like some other oranges do, and it’s dry, not super dry, but definitely not juicy. It’s got more body than FA Orange (but still not a lot of it) but that base is a bit waxy. Probably not a lone orange for an orange juice or orange-forward vape, but could definitely be helpful for adding some realistic orange flavor to one of those or to some other citrus mix.

I need it for a Fruity Pebbles recipe, either [Manson and The Pebbles](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/227657#manson_and_the_pebbles_developed_by_developed) or potentially a slight improvement to that. And because I want to try Hurricane.

And this [Mango Champagne](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/179573#2020_a_mango_champagne_recipe_by_enyawreklaw) **TASK 43**

**RY4**

There’s some sweet brown-sugary caramel-type flavor underneath and a lot of tobacco that’s a little spicy and a little hay-like. It definitely needs at least a short steep. Freshly mixed at 4%, it had a horridly acrid nail polish off note on top; I could barely vape it. At 6 days that drops off into a very faint slightly bitter or vinegary edge, a bit odd, but no longer unpleasant. The caramel flavor is there and there’s the slightest of vanilla in it, but no thick creamy richness like you expect with a caramel.  It finishes very dry but I’m fine with tobacco doing that. Pretty sure I’ll survive without this flavor. I’ve tried one good recipe that used it and already tossed the FA Irish Cream that I would’ve needed to make that one again. **TRASH 14**

New Flavor Count: 2,434  

**Note**

There won’t be a “Getting Rid of Most of My Flavors” post next week or the week after (unless, of course, someone else starts trying to systematically and publicly recover from their own flavor hoarding compulsion). There might not even be one the week after that. But GRoMoMF will be back on June 4 at the very latest.
