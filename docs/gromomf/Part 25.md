# CAPELLA

**Cinnamon Danish Swirl** and **Cinnamon Sugar**

Updates. Snickerdoodles are my favorite type of cookie. So before I mixed and tried (and demolished) another batch of [Pheasant Ridge](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/64553#pheasant_ridge_by_fear) and realized I had to hang on to CAP Cinnamon Danish Swirl for that at least, my concern was being able to make a great snickerdoodle vape without it. To that end, I tried [CV Snickerdoodle](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/242560#cv_snickerdoodle_by_chainvapor) and liked it very much. It’s proof you don’t need CAP CDS for that. Is it perfect? Not to my taste. First, it’s more representative of one of those hard crunchy snickerdoodles, and just a matter of personal preference, I like the soft, practically gooey ones. Second, again, personal preference, it’s a bit heavy handed with the sucralose. 0.5% CAP Super Sweet is usually too much for a non-candy recipe for me, I think subbing an equal amount of FW Sweetener would be perfect. Also, there’s some separation between the cookie and the butter. So, if we’re being super nitpicky, it tastes like someone laced butter with Splenda and smeared that on a crunchy snickerdoodle. Not gross, actually delicious, but a little strange.

At the same time, I mixed the first version of a snickerdoodle cookie of my own and gave it the same two-week steep as the CV Snickerdoodle. It also tasted pretty good but quite imperfect. I relied too heavily on CAP Sugar Cookie and went way overboard with the FLV Rich Cinnamon and the result was kinda artificial tasting and lots of the cookie was lost under all that cinnamon. I will try again. There were already many similarities between what I made and the CV Snickerdoodle, not from copying, but just because these are obvious ingredients for the job. This time, though, I’m really just slightly revising CV Snickerdoodle to try to make it more to my liking.

Snickerdoodle Credit CV, V1 **TASK 1**

Co. | Flavor | %
---|---|----
CAP | Cinnamon Sugar | 2
WF  | Cookie Butter | 2.5
TFA | Marshmallow | 1.5
FA  | Meringue | 1
FLV | Rich Cinnamon | 0.06
FA | Soho | 1.5
FW | Sweetener | 0.5
FA | Vanilla Cookie | 2.5
CAP | Sugar Cookie | 2

I’m swapping the sweeteners. Dropping the FA Butter because I think that’s where the smeared-on butter impression was coming from. Increasing the Rich Cinnamon from the 0.04% in CV’s version to make it a bit more cinnamon-y, but keeping it much lower than the whopping 0.1% my dumb ass had used in mine. A little less Soho and FA Vanilla Cookie to make it a little less crunchy, adding 2% CAP Sugar Cookie to replace the lost bakery notes from doing that with some softer cookie flavor, but not the 4.5% I mistakenly thought was a good concentration to build a snickerdoodle around.
  
# FLAVOR WEST

**Sweet Cream**

Accidentally skipped over this last time. It mostly tastes like canned whipped cream, just sweet and creamy, soft and mild, smooth, without much actual flavor overall other than a mild butteryness and some vanilla, but slightly weird off notes at 2%. There’s something slightly nut-tasting about it and it has an even more slight chemical aftertaste. I probably wouldn’t choose it because there are better options for cream and whipped cream, and I don’t see it used in anything I want to mix. **TRASH 1**

**Toasted Marshmallow**

This doesn’t really taste anything like a toasted marshmallow, and it’s pretty weird, but it does seem like it might be used in some interesting ways. It’s very sweet in the finish but it’s like a blank voluminous sweetness, doesn’t really taste like a marshmallow. Not finding any vanilla. Upfront where it should be toasted, instead there’s some light and slightly roasted nutty weirdness with a touch of something savory, almost like an unsalted soy sauce taste thing, that reminds me of the sweet yet savory aspects of Mom & Pops Calipitter Chow and OSDIY Lucky Shot a little bit. I wouldn’t be super shocked if I found out this is one of the components to those things. It’s pretty dry by itself though, to the point it seems like it would dry a mix out. Like a dry cereal marshmallow, without the marshmallow flavor. Just dense, dry, and gritty sweet. Truly an oddball flavor, but I could see it working in bakeries, especially dry gritty ones, and sweet tobacco mixes, and who knows what else, just don’t piss on my head and tell me we’re toasting marshmallows.  Again, nothing I want to mix uses it. **TRASH 2**

**Toffee Dream Cream**

I think it’s supposed to be vanilla toffee ice cream in a cone. The in a cone part is the only way I can explain the weird sharp, nutty bakery taste it has. It tastes like just straight up acetyl pyrazine right on top, not really like a ice cream cone or cookie or whatever it’s supposed to be, and it’s odd. Beyond that, there is something toffee-ish, a darker crisp brown sugary sweetness, as well as an underlying rich, sweet vanilla cream. That weird bakery note, though. I wish it didn’t have that. It seems like it could be covered up with other, better bakery ingredients for all kinds of dessert things, but I don’t know about just using it as a toffee ice cream flavor and pretending it’s not there.  Again, nothing I want to mix uses it. **TRASH 3**

 **Tres Leches**

 It’s really unfortunate that it has 10 to 20% sugar syrup in it. It’s not as gunky as some of the other SUGAR WARNING Flavor West flavors, but seriously, don’t vape sugar, people. I will not be replacing it when it runs out for that reason, but I don’t want to toss it because it tastes really good. A very sweet, creamy, thick, and slightly sour - just enough to be perfectly authentic - condensed milk flavor, with a little sweet cake behind it and just a touch of dark, carmelly sweetness near the finish. It’s in some recipes I already plan to try, and there are a couple more that look good to me.

[Blue Milk Cake](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/230544#blue_milk_cake_by_alan_vapes) **TASK 2**

[Custard Lover](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/140800#custard_lover_by_the_flavah_maker) **TASK 3**

**Tropical Cream Breeze**

Mostly tastes like sweet candy orange with fluffy and milky smooth cream base, similar to a dreamsicle bar, but with enough hints of mango mixed with the orange and a touch of coconut attached to the cream to make “tropical” an apt description. Kind of an odd, busy flavor but very tasty. It’s a little weak on top before you get that candy orange/mango thing, then the milkier cream and a sweet coconut finish that is a bit like FLV Sweet Coconut and makes for a velvety smooth finish.

I'll give this 5-year-old recipe that still looks pretty tasty to me a try before I toss it. [3 days 2 nights](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/69328#3_days_2_nights_by_thadentman). **TASK 4**  

**Tropical Punch**

 It’s not a “red” Hawaiian punch, it’s more of an orange-yellow mix of fake fruit flavors, not natural fruit juice. Candied/artificial orange-pineapple mix up front, with a lot of sweetness right up top, surprisingly smooth and not harsh for orange or pineapple, with sweet apple juice behind it and maybe a hint of mango. I think this is one of their flavors that has actual sugar in it. I’d mess around with other oranges and pineapples before this; it doesn’t have that Yellow Cake or Cake Batter Dip amazingness that might cause you to overlook the cancer/coil gore. **TRASH 4**

**Unicorn Vomit**

Haven’t tried it yet. But I’ll mix [this.. um...recipe?](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/277415#unicorn_vomit_by_rekohms) and see what it’s all about. **TASK 5**

**Vanilla Bean Ice Cream**

FW Vanilla Bean Ice Cream tastes like the ice cream on the inside of a cheap ice cream truck treat or like ice cream you might be given at a poor kid’s birthday party. It’s actually pretty delicious, but it’s more of a heavily sweetened whipped cream than ice cream. Kind of light and fluffy, but very sweet and fairly creamy. It manages to be quite sweet without being dry, which is nice, and smooth. There might be a bit of butter there but no eggy custardy business. It’s got a nice little dairy tang to it. The vanilla is more of a brighter vanilla extract-ish flavor, so it’s kind of insulting that they had the nerve to call it FW Vanilla BEAN ice cream, but easy to forgive because it tastes good. I just think it has more of a whipped cream body than ice cream and don’t tend to reach for it if the profile calls for ice cream.

I need it to mix more of a favorite, [Crumberry Cream](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/113695#crumberry_cream_by_jbird). It is an outstanding recipe! That FW Wild Berry Cobbler is great on its own but PUR Boysenberry Preserves leveling up the cooked berry and CAP Sugar Cookie reinforcing its otherwise light crust note, make it even better. These three together perfectly nail the crust and cooked dark berries that taste like a combination of blackberries, strawberries, raspberries, and blueberries. I don’t know whether it’s more of a light ice cream or a heavy whipped cream filling it out with rich creamy vanilla on top, it’s not an extra-rich thick ice cream, but it’s delicious without distracting from the cobbler itself. **TASK 6**

What else should I try?

[Vanilla Oreo Milkshake](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/124085#vanilla_oreo_milkshake_by_steamon). **TASK 7**

[Creamy Pistachio](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/139567#creemy_pistachio_by_dumhed). With FLV Cream lending some weight to that fluffy FW VBIC, I can see this very simple recipe working out really well. **TASK 8**

[Tommy’s Tangerine Cheesecake](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/238350#tommy_s_tangerine_cheesecake_by_slugjuice). I’m a sucker for creamy citrus stuff. **TASK 9**

**Vanilla Cup Cake**

Tonight when I go to bed, I’m definitely going to be thinking about how stupid I was to enter this flavor into my spreadsheet twice, once with a space between Cup and Cake. Gotta revise the starting flavor count again. **TASK 10**

**Vanilla Cupcake**

Uncooked vanilla cake mix. It’s vanilla and sweet and but very dry, dry enough to make me thirsty. It’s full but kind of bland and doesn’t have anything to suggest cream, eggs, butter, oil, or anything moist at all. I have to imagine that this is what it would taste like if you had vanilla cake mix and just ate the mix. I could see it working with both some sweet, buttery, custardy cream to moisten it and a soft bakery like CAP Sugar Cookie to create a vanilla cupcake but at that point you might as well get just any other vanilla and go from there.  

I don’t have super high expectations for them, but I’ll try this [Cup of Cake](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/195183#a_cup_of_cake_by_kylezkloudz) **TASK 11**

And wait out the month-long steep on this [Butt’ers CupCake](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/282034#butt_ers_cupcake_by_pirajah) **TASK 12**

**Vanilla Custard**

Chalky electric vanilla. It’s not a custard. It’s vanilla-forward, but that vanilla is deeply weird, it tastes artificial and a little plasticky and it tastes like they tried to go for a dark, spicy vanilla bean by adding some nutmeg to it and just missed the mark entirely. It has some cream behind it but that cream is also oddly very chalky. It’s just a messed-up, no-good flavor. **TRASH 5**

**Waffle Cone**

This is a pretty good but badly misnamed flavor. More of a waffle flavor than a waffle cone. Actually better waffle than most waffle flavors, which can get pretty gross. There’s a pretty prominent buttery maple accent here and last I checked butter maple is something you want on a waffle, but not on a waffle cone. It is pretty dry, which would place it more in waffle cone territory, but it also doesn’t have as much of that toasted egg white/meringue type flavor that’s a more prominent part of a waffle cone. So not a waffle cone, but not quite a waffle either. People who want a drier, crispier waffle with lighter maple should definitely check it out. People who want a waffle cone for ice cream, might want to skip it, unless maybe it’s some kind of maple ice cream.

Supposedly it [helps three other common flavors turn into Golden Grahams](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/236396#golden_grahams_by_sessiondrummer), this I’ve gotta see **TASK 13**

**Watermelon**

That is a foul thing.. It does not taste like watermelon.  It kind of tastes like lipstick, but not just a little, like a whole mouthful just all up in the facehole, just eating lipstick for a snack. Really unpleasant, chemcialish, awful. It does have quite a bit of almost creamy body to it but when something is this yucky and tastes like some kind of cosmetic product, that’s not helpful. Not helpful at all. **TRASH 6**

**Whipped Cream**

Very meh. It’s not very flavorful, and I think it could have a slight cardboardy off note but that might also just be what my brain is filling into an absence of flavor.  The heart of “whipped cream” is there - it’s smooth and sweet and fluffy, with some dairy taste and teensy hint of vanilla, but it’s light and not very thick, without any richness to it at all.

I really liked this [Raincoat](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/67279#raincoat_by_jigsaw314) recipe years ago, but I don’t remember whether I love it enough to keep FW Whipped Cream to make more. Need a refresher course. **TASK 14**

**Whisky**

No shit, this tastes like it has dog food in it. It otherwise tastes a lot like Whiskey and I know it can be a useful ingredient because I’ve seen it in action, but fuck if it doeson’t have a bit of rancidity in the base that tastes an awful lot like dry dog food flavor. Might be worth picking up to use to warm bakeries without thinning them out at a low percent but trying to get it to be a cocktail vape is just going to be nasty. **TRASH 7**

**White Cake**

Soft and light but has some grainier texture and a little vanilla frosting. Similar to their Birthday Cake but without that obnoxious weird artificial food coloring note that you get from the Birthday Cake. Sweet and fluffy but maybe a little stale, almost but not quite cardboardy. Possibly a little chalky? Doesn’t have rich butter or eggy notes to it, leaving it a little dry, but that adds to the authenticity for something like a white cake you’d buy at the grocery store. Has a balance of something like 10% frosting and 90% cake as a single flavor, but it’s so soft I can easily see that 90% being the first part that gets covered up in a mix.

[Vanilla Pudding Poke Cake](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/99648#vanilla_pudding_poke_cake_by_jazzy_girl) looks worth a mix for sure! **TASK 15**

So does [Rin’s Cherry Cupcake](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/147156#rin_s_cherry_cupcake_by_mixinvixens) **TASK 15.5**

And her [Blackcurrant Lime Cake](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/175489#rin_s_blackcurrant_lime_cake_by_mixinvixens) **TASK 16**

And this [Sweet Vanilla White Cake](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/202026#sweet_vanilla_white_cake_by_badag) **TASK 17**

And this [Car-Nilla Custard Cake](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/294242#car_nilla_custard_cake_by_lynda_marie) **TASK 18**

**White Chocolate**

Imperfect, but workable. There’s something a little bakery-esque and borderline cardboardy at the start of the exhale that throws it off profile a bit. At higher concentrations than around 4%, it even gets a little raisin-y. There’s also a bit of chalkiness in the finish. But the 80% in the middle gets it done; smooth, dense, heavy, thick, buttery, creamy, hint of vanilla and authentic cocoa butter.  I’m still on the lookout for an even better white chocolate option, but until I find it, a FW White Chocolate and FLV White Chocolate combo works pretty well.

I need it for [GTKK 2019](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/136863#gtkk_2019_by_id10_t), at least until I find a better white chocolate and create a better green tea kit kat. The original sounds pretty good right now, though. **TASK 19**

Same for [Holy Peepus](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/92939#holy_peepus_yearofmixing_by_id10_t) **TASK 20**

I also need it for [Crazberry Crack](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/32359#crazberry_crack_by_jbird). Deeelicious! **TASK 21**

I also wanna try this really interesting looking nuts and chocolate mix [So-Ho-Ho-Ho](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/254946#so_ho_ho_ho_after_presents_remix_by_mixm) **TASK 22**

And [Pistachio Blondie](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/140704#pistachio_blondie_developed_by_developed) **TASK 23**

**White Grape**

I wasn’t expecting too much from this so I wasn’t too let down. It does mostly taste like sweet white or green grape and is mostly Ok. But if I want to be nitpicky, which I do, it’s a little sharp on top and then there’s a little something spoiled about it, fermented. Instead of that crisp, clean green grape flavor, it tastes a little rotten, like that one grape in the bottom of bag that fell off the bunch and got all smooshed and grody. It is very obnoxiously sweet. You can probably find some creative use for it, but I’ll pass. **TRASH 8**

**Wild Cherry**

It vapes really smooth, especially for a slightly tangy flavor, but also tastes like there might be a touch of vanilla in there. It might taste a little cough droppy, but I don’t get any plastic from this. Soap isn’t any better than plastic, though, IMO, and it does come across as having a perfumy soapiness to me, both at 2.5% and when I tried it again at 1.25%, even though it wasn’t as flavorful at 1.25%, the perfumy soap is still there. **TRASH 9**

**Wildberry Cobbler**

Also sold as Wildberry Cobbler a la mode. I don’t know what that “a la mode” business is about, it doesn’t taste like there’s any ice cream there, but otherwise, pretty damn legit... Warm, dark, sweet, jammy cooked mixed berries that mostly taste like a combination of blackberries and strawberries up front and later in the exhale, a soft and somewhat doughy bakery. No floral or medicinal notes. It’s well rounded and a solid as a single flavor so I’m not sure what to do with it, because toss in some spice (cardamom comes to mind first, maybe cinnamon)  or of course some whipped cream or ice cream (though that might require adding some more bakery - like CAP Sugar Cookie - to boost the relatively light and soft bakery flavor here).  Bakery is just a bit buttery. Very smooth compared to many other mixed berry flavors.  

I need it for the Crumberry Cream mentioned above under FW VBIC, but oh my goodness, the things people have done with this one look so good.

For example:

[Bite Me](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/130699#bite_me_by_diydownunderpippa). **TASK 24**

[Bleeding Berry Cobbler](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/66359#bleeding_berry_cobbler_by_tamvapes) **TASK 25**

[Mixed Berry Crumble Tart](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/218646#mixed_berry_crumble_tart_by_sensory_overload) **TASK 26**
  
**Wine Blush Chablis**

It’s a little light, not a flavor that really slaps, probably needs to try higher, but I’ll be damned if it doesn’t really taste just like a nice pink wine, like a white zen or rose. Very sweet but a little boozy, just unmistakably tastes like it’s supposed to.
  
I’m going to try to make a froze rose vape out of it.

1-2-3 Froze Rose **TASK 27**

Co. | Flavor | %
---|---|----
FW| Wine Blush Chablis | 3
FW  | Pink Bubbly | 2
BCF | WS-23 (30%) | 1

**Wine Merlot**

A little gross. It’s dark and grapey and very sweet berry notes and a deep, almost rich base, and mostly tastes like it should, it has some of that same yeasty thing going on. Like there’s a bit of FA Joy in there.. It’s not strong, but it lingers in the aftertaste and just ruins it. Also it apparently contains some sugar syrup, so I’m glad it’s not good.  **TRASH 10**  

**Wine Red**

I did not find it unpleasant at all, but it is deeply weird. It tastes like something that you might add a drop or two of to a wine flavor to make it more interesting, but without any of the actual wine. I picked up some blackberry, blueberry, and sweet chocolate (which was unexpected), with subtle woodiness, and a cream base (also unexpected), but no wine. No grape flavor either. It feels really rich and creamy. Maybe if you had a grape and you mixed in a very small amount of this and some FA Liquid Amber or Brandy flavor or something to booze it up you could create a wine flavor? I don’t know. **TRASH 11**

**Wine White**

Sweet white grape with a side of yeast. Genuinely fermented, but more beer-ish than wine-like. Maybe homemade white toilet wine, made from bread and Welch's white grape.  It’s a little gross. **TRASH 12**  

**Yellow Cake**

Ok, so, it tastes just like a big piece of moist, delicious, sweet, unfrosted yellow box cake. But it also has 20 to 30% fructose. So even if you don’t care what it might be doing to your lungs, think of the cotton. Think of the coils. It’s very unfortunate because it tastes amazing. I will not buy more of it. But I can’t bring myself to toss it either, because CAKE.

I need it for [Yellow Matter Custard](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/97838#yellow_matter_custard_dripping_from_a_dead_dog_s_eye_by_lukeloop) and if I have any Holy Vanilla left by the time I get down this far on my to-do list, I’ll gladly mix some more of that. **TASK 28**

I bet [1-2-3 Pink CakeBawlz](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/135134#1_2_3_pink_cakebawlz_by_deetzz) is great, too. **TASK 29**

And why in the world have I not mixed [St. Louie Butter Cake](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/54710#st_louie_butter_cake_by_mrburgundy) before?! **TASK 30**

**Yogurt**

This tastes like what I would expect an artificial yogurt flavor to taste like, like it’s almost exaggerated in its sour milk yogurty tartness, but vaping it a while it comes off more cheesy than pukey. Very creamy, very thick, with a buttery undertone. Sweeter than most yogurts, kind of a dark sweetness. Very smooth, not chalky.

I don’t care much for yogurt vapes, and I’m getting pretty tired of seeing this in seemingly everything, to the point I almost wanna just toss it out of spite. But some of those recipes look like they might taste at least a little better than spite feels.

Such as, [Butterface](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/211319#butterface_by_slushy). **TASK 31**

[Guava Paste Cheesecake](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/183966#guava_paste_cheesecake_by_lediybr) **TASK 32**

[Strawberry Cream Savers](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/305710#strawberry_cream_savers_noted_mwc_by_jasonvape420) **TASK 33**

And a few that are already on the to-mix list.

**Yumberry**

Red berry (more like strawberry with a hint of tart candy cherry than anything else) bubblegum with an unfortunate woody off-note. Did you drop your weird berry bubblegum on some sawdust and then pick it up and keep chewing it anyway? Despite that odd woody flavor, it’s not dry, it’s actually juicy, and it tastes like that dusty wood note could be covered up as it’s not very prominent but it might be something to look out for.

I might trash it soon, but I want to try [Brain Elixir](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/165387#brain_elixir_by_vensyboy) first, mostly for that CAP Sweet Guava and FLV Guanabana combo. **TASK 34**

**Chai Tea**

I sorted this stupid spreadsheet by brand (alphabetically) and then by flavor (alphabetically) and have no idea how this one and the next two flavors wound up under Yumberry.

It tastes super nasty, and not at all like Chai Tea. Pretty much unvapeably bad. There’s not much spice to it, it mostly tastes like sweet tea mixed with dirty old fryer grease. My atomizer was salvageable but it also gunked up my coil really bad. I don’t know what they put in this stuff but it doesn’t taste safe to vape. Doesn’t help that the concentrate is very dark and weirdly thick. **TRASH 13**

**Natural Kiwi**

Definitely not the same as FW Kiwi, which is a great candy kiwi. The concentrate is not even the same color. My FW Kiwi is clear as water and by FW Kiwi Natural is like an amber color. FW Kiwi Natural is terrible. It tastes like old mushy rotten banana smell with an inexplicable tartness, like a squeeze of lime on a rotten banana. **TRASH 14**

**Sour**

Not only is that not sour, it tastes like cardboard. Not just like a flavor with a little cardboardy off note. It tastes like I’m vaping an intentionally Cardboard flavored juice, only a little sweeter than unflavored juice. I tried licking my 2% FW Sour sample (please don’t lick undiluted concentrates, you could hurt yourself doing that) and it was very sweet and still cardboardy, but also a little sour. So there’s something sweet in there that vapes well and a little something sour that doesn’t. Plus cardboard. **TRASH 15**
