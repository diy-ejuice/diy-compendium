Starting flavor count: 2,541 - 9 because someone pointed out (thanks again!) that I forgot to subtract the 9 I threw away in part 23 = 2,532 (down from 2,972)

TASK OR TRASH - Each flavor gets assigned at least one task or it goes in the trash.

# CAPELLA Fresh Pineapple

Update. My first attempt to remix this [recipe](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/195140#iyslpc_by_id10_t) into Another Pina Colada Recipe by consolidating the two pineapples into one with my new favorite, CAP Fresh Pineapple, was unbalanced, unsurprisingly, but promising.

This is what I mixed:

Co. | Flavor | %
---|---|----
CAP | Fresh Pineapple | 5
WF | Coconut Custard | 1.25
FA | Coconut | 1
FA | Jamaican Rum | 1
BCF | WS-23 (30%) | 0.5

Not too much pineapple, but too little coconut and too little rum. Too little flavor overall.

This is what I’ll mix next time:

Another Pina Colada V2 **TASK 1**

Co. | Flavor | %
---|---|----
CAP | Fresh Pineapple | 6
WF | Coconut Custard | 1.5
FA | Coconut | 1.25
FA | Jamaican Rum | 1.5
BCF | WS-23 (30%) | 0.5

Because sometimes that’s what we have to do, just keep making minor adjustments until it all clicks into just the right places.

# FLAVORAH

**Back Bar Bitters**

Getting ready to go in on some fancy gin flavors made me realize I went from part 26 to part 27 and forgot FLV Back Bar Bitters.

Not really bitter to vape. It has a nice spicy depth to it: cinnamon, ginger, and cloves, along with some floral touch. It has some fruity sweetness before it cuts to a much less sweet aftertaste. Aromatic Bitters should taste of orange peel but this is more like candied orange peel, all the sweetness in here is tied to the orange, and it also has just a bit of something darker underneath, like dried fig but not obviously fig. Something in the prune or raisin family. It tastes like it would be great in a holiday bakery like fruitcake, or for something like mulled wine.  I need it for [Gourd is Dead](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/236620#gourd_is_dead_by_wolfwheeler). I wan to try this [Bitter Sweet Passion](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/143760#bitter_sweet_passion_passion_fruit_coconut_orange_bitters_by_mech_mod_rn) passionfruit, coconut, orange bitters recipe. **TASK 2**

**Banana**

I also forgot banana when doing the Flavorah.

I tastes like odd combination of Laffy Taffy candy banana top notes with rich, very thick, sweet, ripe, banana with a silky smooth mouthfeel. Personally I think it is heavenly! Especially that silky sweetness (sweeter than an actual banana, like a sweetened smooshed banana) - but stay under two 2% to avoid it having a hint of cloves (for me, others might be able to take it higher) but that’s okay because 1.5% is a full-flavored vape. I need it for [Burley Boiz](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/69680#burly_boiz_by_matthewkocanda) and am very interested in [Bactus](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/142530#bactus_by_ruderudi) banana + cactus, which would not seem like such a weird combination to you if you're familiar with the work of /u/philosaphucker. Really miss that guy.  **TASK 3**

# FLAVORMONKS

**Blackberry**

It tastes like real blackberry. It’s sweet and has some jammy body, but the top notes have some tartness and touch of floral that tastes right rather than perfumy. That jammy body also has a hair of earthy funkiness, like a fresh-picked wild blackberry. Sort of reminds me of CAP Sweet Currant, with just enough funk for authenticity, which might turn some people off, but I don’t think it goes overboard at all. And it’s a very bold, full-bodied flavor. I don’t get anything I’d call an off note from it.

[Sagittarius A v3](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/146548#sagittarius_a_v3_by_ediblemalfunction) is a nice-looking blackberry lemon-lime popsicle recipe. **TASK 4**

 **Divine Raspberry**

I have 3 raspberries from Flavour Monks and the other two are much better. The Divine Raspberry is... not Divine. It’s candish raspberry and very sugary sweet, with a solid bit of spearmint, but otherwise tastes softly floral and a bit medicinal and leaves me with a  faint but nasty soapy aftertaste. FM Divine Raspberry is the wrong FM raspberry. Even if it doesn’t taste too floral or medicinal to you, it’s going to have pretty limited use, being raspberry mixed with spearmint.  **TRASH 1**

**Gin & Tonic**

Their Pure Gin with a lot of authentic tonic, but missing some lime and also really want to add cooling to it, and well as more gin. It’s mostly tonic. That tonic water bitterness overwhelms some of the nuance of the Pure Gin but the basics are there - it’s boozy and juniper berryish with a little bit of herbal fun behind it. There’s some more citrus than in the Pure Gin and it’s more limey than orangy, but still missing that the real wedge or two of lime that I want here (VT Persian Lime? FA Aurora?). Sweet, but so is G&T a little. Add Polar blast rather than WS-23 so that if it interferes with anything it will be Tonic and it won’t mess with the gin as much.

I was dismayed to not find a recipe already made for this, so I’ll start one.

G&T V1 **TASK 5**

Co.| Flavor | %
---|---|----
FM | Gin & Tonic | 4
FM | Pure Gin | 2
VT | Persian Lime| 1
FA | Aurora | 1
FA | Polar Blast | 0.5

**Gin in Paris**

Deeply weird to me. It’s a nice enough vape, but just weird. FM Says “Our best gin, combined with pure orange based on a soft banana flavor.” It’s supposed to be sort of like mixing gin and a banana into an orange julius. You get how that’s weird, right?

And it does have plenty of banana. It’s predominantly gin, with boozy junipery gin upfront, but it tastes like a ripe and creamy banana with a hint of banana candy after that and a little twist of orange zest on the end. It’s fun and interesting, but odd.What any of that has to do with Paris, I have no idea.  

I’m already planning to try [Gin Basil Smash](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/52522#gin_basil_smash_by_besejuiced). The notes on that recipe, combined with the way Gin in Paris tastes to me, gives me an idea. It might be a crazy, stupid idea, but it’s an idea. Gin Basil Smash’s creator suggested that some INW Cactus would be a good addition to it. Cactus and banana... that made me think of the cactus king himself, Philosaphucker. Cactus, banana, and orange? That’s specifically Philosaphucker’s old [Detox](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/15465#detox_by_philosaphucker) recipe. Could I add gin to a modified version of that? Holy crap, I think I could.

Retox V1 **TASK 6**

Co.| Flavor | %
---|---|----
FM| Gin in Paris | 3
VT | Banana Cream | 4
CAP | Fresh Pineapple | 4
VT | Yoghurt Drink | 4
INW | Cactus | 1

Gin-infused pineapple-banana-cactus-orange smoothie for those who just got out of detox and need to retox.

**Gin Orange**

Who doesn’t love gin & juice? Unfortunately, this one comes across as more of juniper forward boozy gin made with some bitter orange peel, as well as a sweeter orange finish. I’m missing the real OJ body here. It’s like their Pure Gin, but with the citrus that is part of that gin turned way up, drowning out some of the herbal nuance.  I want gin and OJ, but I’m getting just gin made with extra orange peel, served with an orange slice sunk to the bottom of the glass, basically. I want more orange. But, orange is hard, and there are other oranges, and the orange that’s there is good, so I can work with it, if I want Gin & Juice. It has to be an orange without too much peel though, because this already has peel a’plenty. Really think people are sleeping on a tiny dose of gin flavors to give fruit mixes some zing though, and this flavor is a reminder. Seems like a touch of it could really liven up a citrus mix both with the juniper and the orange peel and zest.  

I have an idea. It might turn out to have been a bad idea, but it’s an idea. Mimosa meets Gin & Juice.

New Miserable Morning V1 **TASK 7**

Co.| Flavor | %
---|---|----
VT | Blood Orange Champagne | 5
FM | Gin Orange | 3
FW | Sweetener | 0.5

**Monks in Love**

Soft, not very flavorful, but absolutely tastes like what it’s supposed to be, orange and strawberry. Very natural strawberry right on top with authentic orange behind it and a lingering strawberry finish, not too sweet. Nothing really wrong with it, just soft, but like it’s watered down or made of out of season fruits. It’s not really saturated. Maybe it needs more than 7% (first tried it at 3%), maybe it needs a steep (7% had only a day), but as best I can tell so far it needs some kind of help to be good, either more orange or more strawberry or both. Or something. I don’t think a strawberry-orange that needs help with both the strawberry and the orange is something I need. **TRASH 2**

**OMGIN**

A sweeter, more floral, smoother, less juniper-y, less-spicy gin with a light mixed berry base that tastes fancy AF. The juniper that’s there is brighter and less woody. Tastes like if this were an actual gin, I could not afford it. Just barely boozy enough. Light mixed berry Forest Fruity-ish base tastes like mixed berries were steeped in gin, and is just delightful, though it probably has quite an impact on the versatility, I’m sure there are a lot of mixing applications where you wouldn’t want berries in your gin. But as a single flavor? Hell yes.

I have an idea, most of it stolen from [Dry Drunk](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/130750#dry_drunk_berry_infused_gin_by_nowar), a tremendous old recipe that needs a remix because INW Lemon Mix is no more.

Wet Drunk (Raspberry-Infused Gin) V1 **TASK 8**

Co.| Flavor | %
---|---|----
FM| OMGIN | 4
SSA | Raspberry Syrup | 2
FA | Raspberry | 1
CAP | Sweet Currant | 1
FA | Polar Blast | 0.5

Instead of the mixed-berry gin of Dry Drunk, I want to roll all that mixed berry goodness into a distinctly raspberry flavor. Hoping the CAP Sweet Currant will give it some of the magic that the combination of FA Blackcurrant and CAP Sweet Guava gave the original recipe.

**Orange**

Seems that while it might be a great tool, it isn’t an incredible single flavor. It’s one of the more realistic plain naval orange juice flavors, smooth, but fairly soft, not a lot of punch to it. Maybe like the perfect emulation of the juice of an out of season or under-ripe orange, or something like that. Sweet, but not candy. Thicker, unlike many orange flavors, it really has some body to it. Seems like it would be excellent as a background orange that might be present, more in the base than whatever is out front and on top, and but not compete too much with whatever the main flavor is. I do not get anything I’d call an off note from it, it’s just soft. Also smooth. 3% I thought the softness might be under-concentration so I tried it again at 6%ish and it does get a bit bolder, but also slightly floral in a perfumy way. So maybe there’s a sweet spot in there somewhere where it stands out more and is still that realistic OJ flavor without being floral, or 6% is fine in a mix and that floral can be covered up. Or maybe it just needs some more steeping. I’m not going to spend my time trying to find out. **TRASH 3**

**Pistachio**

This came highly recommended to me so YMMV, but I wasn’t super impressed by it. I have TFA Pistachio for that artificial pistachio ice cream flavor and FLV Pistachio for the realest pistachio I can imagine vaping, what more do I really need? This one seems to be in the middle of those but leaning a little more on the TFA ice cream flavor side of the pistachio spectrum. **TRASH 4**

**Pure Gin**

I’m not sure what exactly I expected, but for as expensive as this is, I expected it to be a lot more than marginally better than FLV and VT gins, and I’m not sure that it is. It’s it better? You bet. But THAT much better? Not really. On the other hand, it is the best, and sometimes you want the best, whether it’s a lot better or even just a bit better. It’s more legitimately boozy than those alternatives, but it also has a lot of complexity, and it’s wet. There’s some throat hit and it seems tied up with that booziness. It’s warm, like taking a shot of liquor, not dry or chemically harsh.  It’s really just straight-up gin. Fairly soft, but not quite as mellow as VT’s. I get a sharper kick of juniper berries than either VT or FLV gins, but not as shoving-Christmas-trees-up-my-nose as FA’s gin. There’s a lot of neat stuff going on behind that. Some aromatic herbals like greens, specifically peppery arugula, hints of orange peel, floral that’s more wildflower than the more lavender-ish floral in FLV’s gin. Sweetness is very mild and seems perfect for a straight gin. Nice body and depth here. Thick enough to be satisfying but thin and juicy-feeling enough for a beverage flavor.  

I need it for my aforementioned plan to attempt a gin and tonic.

I also wouldn’t mind straight up martini, at least until I can figure out what it wants me to add to it. A twist of lemon would be nice, but unfortunately I’ve not found a flavor that can do a twist of lemon quite like the discontinued INW Lemon Mix did.

Martini Rocks V1 **TASK 9**

Co.| Flavor | %
---|---|----
FM| Pure Gin | 4
FW| Martini | 2
FA | Bitter Wizard | 0.5
FA | Polar Blast | 0.5

**Raspberry**

A sweet, syrupy, candy-type red raspberry flavor. Very flavorful. I love how it really tastes like raspberry - not so much a real raspberry but identifiable as a red raspberry flavor - without any of the florality that raspberries tend to give off. FM Raspberry is pretty one-noted, it tastes like artificially-flavored raspberry pancake syrup, without any complexity. But it tastes like a lot of it, without the annoying off notes that plague so many of raspberry flavors. This is very similar to SSA Raspberry Syrup. Marginally better, I think, but very similar. And there are only a handful of recipes for FM Raspberry while there are dozens and dozens for SSA Raspberry Syrup, so I’ll let go of this excellent flavor. It’s in the post title. **TRASH 5**

**Red Gin**

Lots of syrupy sweet red fruit drowning out the gin quite a bit but the resulting flavor is intriguing by itself and probably has some cocktail possibilities. FM says it’s dark cherries, but I couldn’t identify that as a cherry without checking and after checking I’d say it’s definitely more of a bright red Maraschino type cherry or cherry candy than a dark anything. I’m not getting any of those shower curtain vibes from it though, which makes me really interested in trying FM Cherry. Gin is there at first but faint and mostly juniper, then the herbal stuff lightly comes back around and makes it finish more like Maraschino Liqueur. It’s a pretty dense flavor and very sweet overall, but the gin cleans it up quite a bit if the finish. I would add more gin if you really wanted Gin & Cherries, but you could add a small amount of this to a cocktail that’s supposed to have just a little maraschino liqueur and call it a day.

I’ll try to make a Martinez cocktail out of it. A Martinez has a lot in common with a Manhattan. The ingredients are gin, sweet vermouth, Maraschino liqueur, and Angostura bitters and although cinnamon is just a tiny part of bitters, for some reason the other ingredients really make it stand out so there’s a distinct cinnamon note in the finish.

Martinez V1 **TASK 10**

Co.| Flavor | %

FM| Red Gin | 4
FM | Pure Gin | 2
FW | Martini | 2
INW | Cherries | 1
FLV | Back Bar Bitters | 0.5
FLV| Rich Cinnamon | 0.1

**Sweet Betsy Blackberry**

It’s just their regular blackberry, but loaded up with sucralose. It’s not bad and might even be better than their regular blackberry as a single flavor and for brand-new mixers accustomed to over-sweetened commercial juice, but I think most of us are perfectly capable of adding our own sweetener to a recipe and would prefer to control own sucralose destiny rather than having flavors pre-loaded with it. Also, there’s enough of it here to take some of the punch away from their regular blackberry, and I think in most cases that’s going to be a negative. **TRASH 6**

**Sweet Betsy Cookie**

Someone gave this to me because he didn’t want it anymore. I never got around to trying it, but based on my experiences with two other “Sweet Betsy” flavors, it’s going to be loaded up with so much sucralose I’m not going to be able to enjoy it, so I’m not even going to bother with that. **TRASH 7**

**Sweet Betsy Raspberry**

FM Sweet Betsy Raspberry tastes like a sugar-free red raspberry Life Saver candy. There’s so much sucralose in here that 2% of it gives the strong sugar lips effect of commercial juice, and it tastes like candy made with sucralose instead of sugar. At 2% flavor, it’s like vaping a mix with 1 to 1.5% CAP Super Sweet added to it. Beyond that FM Sweet Betsy Raspberry is just a syrupy candyish raspberry, and nothing I’d call an off-note. But like, holy artificial sweetener, batman. Seems like using it at like 1% would be great for sweetening a candy raspberry recipe, not sure what else to do with it. **TRASH 8**

**Tobacco Bastards 13 Cohiba**

I don’t remember/can’t find any record of having previously tried this one, I’ll mix a sample at 4% and report back. **TASK 11**

While I have it out, I’ll go ahead and mix [Frank’s Vanilla Cohiba](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/205284#frank_s_vanilla_cohiba_by_nowar). Frank likes it, and I like Frank, and it’s a simple three-ingredient recipe with two other ingredients I’m very familiar with. Mixing very simple recipes with flavors you’re very familiar with is often just as good, sometimes better, than single-flavor testing. It’s when you put it in complex recipes with one or more other unfamiliar flavors that you don’t learn anything about a flavor.  **TASK 12**

**Tobacco Bastards 17 Dark Fire**

I haven’t tried this and to tell you the truth, based on the name I’m a little afraid to. But, where would be if no one ever faced their fears? I’ll mix a sample at 2%. **TASK 13**

**Tobacco Bastards 21 Mint**

I was really hoping for more tobacco here, but it’s mostly peppermint. Despite being a little on the sweet side, it’s more of an herbal peppermint flavor, with the menthol only maybe slightly exaggerated. Refreshing, but not too assertive. What little tobacco is there comes in behind the mint and it’s a perfectly authentic mellow rich-ish blonde hay-like tobacco, there’s just not very much of it. I want to add more tobacco to it, but other than that, I thought it was delightful, definitely a tester that I finished to the last drop, which doesn’t happen often. Anyway, I could have a lot of fun with this one.

[Sous Chef](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/209870#sous_chef_by_nowar) is already on my to-mix list. Similar, but making use of FM Cohiba, is this [La Luna](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/kvp38a/tuesday_tutorial_development_of_a_recipe/) recipe that I’m excited to try. **TASK 14**

**Tobacco Bastards 29 Coffee**

Have not tried, or don’t remember trying. Will mix a 4% sample. **TASK 15**

**Tobacco Bastards 33 Light**

Have not tried, or don’t remember trying. Will mix a 4% sample. **TASK 16**

**Tobacco Bastards 37 Original**

Have not tried, or don’t remember trying. Will mix a 4% sample. **TASK 17**

**Tobacco Bastards 9 Bourbon**

I have tried this and I liked it, but it’s been awhile, don't remember too good anymore, and I didn’t save any notes to give a detailed description. Will mix a 4% sample. **TASK 18**

The two recipes on ATF that use it also use an amount of FLV Connecticut Shade that I’m not comfortable with. Some people just have a much higher tolerance for a large amount of that flavor than I do. But they do give me an idea. I was already planning on making some more of my [Two Kentuckies](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/90550#two_kentuckies_by_id10_t) with the intention of thinking about how to improve it generally and specifically wanting to get rid of the FA Cuban Supreme in there. Isuamadog recently asked me about that and I threw out a suggestion of what I might do, without having mixed it yet. He mixed that and gave me some valuable feedback and now I have a new idea.

Two Kentuckies Two, V2 **TASK 19**

Co. | Flavor | %
---|---|----
FLV | Bourbon | 0.5
FM | Bourbon Tobacco | 3
FLV | Connecticut Shade | 0.25
FLV | Cured Tobacco | 1.0
FLV | Kentucky Blend | 1.75
TFA | Kentucky Bourbon | 2.0
FLV | Red Burley | 0.5

**Vero Gin**

I’m not sure what’s going on here. It’s supposed to be gin and raspberry which sounds delightful, instead I am getting gin and banana. Same wonderful FM Gin on top, but the base tastes like a banana. A somewhat thick and natural, if slightly green, banana. I’ve seen Concrete Rick’s review where he got the same thing, and I read the comments where one person disagreed entirely and reported only getting a nice little raspberry behind the gin. IDK. It’s weird. Gin banana. That banana tasting just a little under-ripe makes me not really like it, and leaves me not knowing what to do with it. If you forced me to do something with it, I might try to cover the banana a strong fruit like pineapple or try to ripen it with a riper banana or a guanabana/soursop type flavor. But no one is forcing me to do anything, so it’s another one for the **TRASH 9**

# FLAVORS EXPRESS

**Apricot**

I like this flavor a lot, but I don’t get apricot from it at all. It tastes more like a peach jolly rancher or flat peach soda. None of the subtlety of an apricot. Higher almost floral yellow peach top notes, heavy syrupy sweet mostly one-dimensional but bold candy candy peach base. Kinda juicy in a mouthwatering candy way, with a bit of tartness from the top notes. I might be able to make something cool out of this if I really wanted to, but I have a bunch of other peaches. **TRASH 10**

**Avocado**

Not accurate, but I think it tastes amazing. It's rich and creamy and very buttery, very sweet. It’s almost a single- flavor over-churned avocado ice cream: Something that might be avocado, cream, butter, and lots of sugar. Some of it caramelized.
The only recipe on ATF that uses it is a very old recipe for “avocado RY4” that’s just two ingredients, the Holy Holy Grail RY4 that no longer exists and FE Avocado.

Lemme just try my hand at one of those.

Burleycado V1 **TASK 20**

Co. | Flavor | %
---|---|----
FE | Avocado | 3
WF | Salted Caramel | 2
CAP | French Vanilla | 2
FLV | Cured Tobacco | 1
FLV | Red Burley | 1.75

**Blueberry**

It mostly tastes like a sweet candy blueberry, mouthwatering, but a little overly sharp, and then down lower in the flavor there’s a bit of tropical-ish funk, like someone tried to make this candy blueberry more natural so they borrowed the funkiness from something like a mango flavor, and the end result isn’t a natural blueberry, just a funky candy blueberry. Of note, this is the same thing that used to be called SC (Super Concentrates) Blueberry at BCF, looks like they don’t have those anymore. Don’t want the weird funky blueberry. **TRASH 11**

**Coconut**

Does Wherther’s make a coconut-flavored candy? Because that’s sort of like what FE Coconut tastes like. Artificial coconut with a darker caramelly butterscotch-ish sweetness. It’s interesting. If it tasted just a little more like a real coconut was involved, it could be that goo all over a German Chocolate Cake, minus the pecans, but instead it tastes more like a candy based on that. I found this to be entirely pleasant, but strange, and I don’t really have a use for it. **TRASH 12**

**Desert Ship**

Light touches of spice including anise and cinnamony spice on top, roasted but not ashy cigarette-type tobacco, on a caramelly sweet but dry base.  Unfortunately FE Desert Ship is a little harsh for me, even with good steep on it, but sometimes with a tobacco you want some of that extra throat hit, and it doesn’t have any gross off notes if you don’t mind the light anise much.  Flavorah’s tobaccos have set a high bar, really spoiled me rotten. I kept almost all of those. I don’t need this. **TRASH 13**

**Fresh Strawberry**

Dry strawberry with a somewhat green floral top note, like smelling a strawberry plant that has both strawberries and blossoms on it. Slight sweet and tart, like a cotton candy dry sort of sweetness and floral tartness like raspberry flavors tend to have. Seems like really a good ingredient for something like a strawberry tea, not entirely sure what else to do with it. **TRASH 14**

**Golden Grape**

I think they meant golden raisin and something got lost in translation. It’s pretty dry and it has that musty note that seems to be unique to raisin-eque flavors, but it’s a much lighter flavor compared to those darker raisins and things like FLV Fig that also have that same mustiness. It’s also very sweet, though it’s that musty bit that really lingers on the palate. You could definitely use it if for whatever reason you were going for something that is supposed to have a golden raisin element. You might even use it to try to modify some other fruit into a dried version of itself, like maybe an apricot. I would not try to use it as a grape. I’m not going to use it all. **TRASH 15**

**Golden Leaf**

Sweet but very ashy, kinda roll-your-old cigarette-y tobacco plus bunch of dry caramelly/brown sugary sweetness. A bit throat scratchy like you get with spices but I did not find any spice notes. I’m not that into the ash, but someone might be, there’s nothing terribly wrong with it. **TRASH 16**

**Golden Passion Fruit**

Terrible. It tastes like tropical fruit scented cleaning product with a bit of hairspray on top. **TRASH 17**
  
**Golden Virginia**

Excellent light (blonde, not soft) and dry peanutty tobacco. Sweet, almost a RY4 level sweetness but not caramel. Not clearly honey or maple but similar to both. Very flavorful. I’m dismayed by the lack of recipes that use this one almost to the point of making my own, but then I thought about how if I want a recipe that uses a sweet mild very peanutty tobacco, there are dozens of options for recipes that use INW 555 Gold. I’ll keep that one and let this one go. **TRASH 18**

**Grape**

Tastes purple. Very similar to a grape Blow Pop, not quite as assertive a grape as that, but similar. Even has that hard candy flavor/texture to it. FWIW, this FE Grape from Flavor Jungle is the same as the SC Grape that BCF used to sell. Tested them one after the other and confirmed.

I used it to make this [1-2-3 Chewy Grape Spree](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/168848#1_2_3_chewy_grape_spree_by_id10_t). I’m going to mix that one again think very deliberately about improving it. **TASK 21**
