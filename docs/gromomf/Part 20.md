# Flavor West

Picking right back up where I got cut off at the end of Part 19.

**Fruit Rings**

It pretty much tastes like Froot Loops. Sweet, slightly grainy, and mostly that Froot Loops flavor that’s mostly lemon but with other less defined fruit flavors behind it. Could use some meringue for that sugary frosting bit and some AP or Cereal 27 to enhance the grainy cereal, but yeah, unmistakably dry Froot Loops; a little lacking but nothing actually “off”. The lemony taste is very slightly cleaning product-y, but again, so is Froot Loops, actually. This is the most accurate of the Froot Loops flavors I’ve tried.

Not the biggest fan of the cereal itself (Pebbles trumps Loops easily for me), but I wouldn’t mind having a good Froot Loops recipe I can mix up if I get in the mood for it, so I’ll try the ones that look best to me.

**Fruity Flakes**

Speaking of Pebbles...

It is a damn shame that this has sugar syrup in it.  It’s not good for your cotton, it’s not good for your coils, and it might not be good for your body, but it’s tasty. It really does taste like Fruity Pebbles, other than just being a little too citrus-forward at 4%. FWIW, if you don’t want a full on fruity pebbles vape and just want to add a little Pebbles to something like a donut or milkshake, you might be able to get away with 1 or 2% like people who still use a little FW Yellow Cake from time to time despite the sugar in that one. 5% is too much, the lemon gets overwhelming and overly pledgy. I promise not to buy more of this once I run out, because of the sugar. But it’s so good. So in the meantime...

[Cereally Easy Pebbles](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/52317#cereally_easy_pebbles_by_krucial). **TASK 5**

[Cookie King](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/177331#cookie_king_fruity_flakes_by_slushy) (with JF instead of FA Cookie and FW Sweetener instead of PUR Super Sweet). **TASK 6**

**Ginger**

Pretty weak at lower percentages, I have to take it up over 5% to get a good strong ginger out of it. Then once I do it mostly tastes something like old dry ginger spice, like it’s actually ginger but its been in the pantry for years and is flat and has lost so much vibrancy that it starts to get a little cardboardy, and then that sort of sits on top of a sweeter, thicker, but not very flavorful base. Certainly useable, but much better options are out there. I’m gonna **TRASH 1** it, but if you have it already, look at [Bloody Ginger Rita](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/148303#bloody_ginger_reeta_by_zander). Hell, look at it anyway. If the notes sound good to you, read the review I left for it. If that sounds good to you, it might be worth picking up FW Ginger just to be able to make it.

**Gingerbread**

Gross. It tastes more like curry than gingerbread. It does have a heavy and rich, thick bakery base, underneath that curry-ish spice. CAP Gingerbread, people. CAP Gingerbread is where it’s at. FW Gingerbread is **TRASH 2**

**Graham Cracker**

Really tastes like an ordinary graham cracker, crispy, brown, and sweet but not overtly sweet baked cookie cracker thing. Maybe not the most versatile, but if you actually want a plain graham cracker flavor and not just a bendable bakery thing, this is a good one, maybe even the best one.

I can’t think of a recipe I need it for, but lots of them already on the task list incorporate it. I’ll add to that:

[Rye’4 Ever](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/167851#rye_4_ever_by_freshepies) **TASK 13**

**Grape**

Fairly meh purple flavor, dull and flat and harmless. Seeing nothing I want to make that uses it, **TRASH 3**

**Grape Soda**

Super Sweet purple. No, seriously Super Sweet. Like, as much or nearly as much sucralose as CAP Super Sweet in the concentrate. Softer than kool aid grape but very close, maybe grape kool aid with a bit too much water, plus an absolute blast of sucralose, like taking a small sip watered down grape koolaid and chasing it with a big fat spoonful of Splenda, even with that slightly bitter and chemically aftertaste that follows the slap of sweetness. I wouldn’t use much more of it than I’d use of Super Sweet, but as a grape- or other dark fruit-specific sweetener around 1% or less and it works very well.

Don’t have a favorite recipe that uses it, but maybe that’s just because I haven’t tried [A$AP Berry Revised](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/207583#a_ap_b_rry_revised_by_vensyboy) yet. **TASK 14**

**Grapeberry Ice**

Flat, sweet candy grape with a shitload of Koolada. I don’t get any berry from it, it just tastes like their regular Grape with a bunch of Koolada, and I mean a bunch. At 5% it even has that sort of cardboardy chemical off note you can get with koolada. I can add my own cooling to my own grape, thanks anyway FW. **TRASH 4**

**Greek Yogurt**

Basically chalk. Slightly tangy but mostly neutral dairy chalk. Kind of a bright white, thick, thing with a slightly stale but not quite off whole milk dairy flavor, but super chalky, making it more of a chalky milk than a yogurt. Slightly sweeter than milk. Not offensive, fairly neutral chalkiness, not really yogurt. **TRASH 5**

**Green Apple**

Halfway between real apple and candy candy apple, like finding a jolly rancher inside a green apple peel. Has just a little of that acetone nail polish remover chemical off-note. Not a lot, unless maybe you’re extra sensitive to it. It’s thick and really sweet. But it also has sugar in it. I only went through about 5 ml of it and that wasn’t enough to gunk my shit up, but I imagine it wouldn’t take too much more to do it and I don’t see the point in vaping sugar when there are much better options. FW Yellow Cake it is not. **TRASH 6**

**Green Goblin**

That really, unmistakably, tastes like the original Green Monster. I even found out the hard way that if you vape it right after brushing your teeth, it’s like drinking Green Monster right after brushing your teeth - I’ll give you a hint, don’t do that. Original green monster has some of that sweet-tarts in battery acid flavor that identifies it as an energy drink but it’s way way sweeter than Red Bull and others, and it has some other stuff going on as well. A few more of the green apple sweet tarts than the other sweet-tart flavors, unlike Red Bull which leans cherry, and hints of bubblegum. FW Green Goblin does all of that, but texturally, it’s a little weird even for a weird profile, as it’s kind of chalky like the sweet tarts were dissolved enough that the candy flavors all melt together but not completely dissolved. What it needs more than anything is something wet to fix that chalkiness without messing with the flavor, but it could also use some sweetener - because Monster is so terribly, pancreas-hurtingly sweet, cooling because warm Monster is gross, and probably something a little “fizzy” like FLV Citrus Soda to carbonate it. I will not be doing any of that, though, because I’m just not that interested in vaping green Monster, never enjoyed drinking it all that much, either.  I’ve gone from drinking Blue RockStar from as soon as that came out until I became a BangBro a few years ago. Gotta love that zero-cal science energy slurry! **TRASH 7**

**Guava**

Strawberry pear. People trying to describe the taste of guava to someone who has never tried a guava have described it as tasting like a  tart strawberry mixed with a pear. This tastes like Flavor West heard that and ran with it. It’s got some candy strawberry-type top notes and a more natural sweet, ripe pear body. Maybe a little funk to it but that just tastes like a very ripe pear rather than coming across as tropical. It doesn’t have any of the citrusy, acidic bite that I’m expecting with guava. It doesn’t really taste like guava at all. But it does taste like it would make a good base for a fruit punch/juice box recipe. Didn’t see an recipe I wanted to make using it, and I have so many damn guava flavors it’ll be nice to ditch one. **TRASH 8**

**Gummy Bear**

Not only does it have 20 to 30% sugar syrup, it tastes terrible. It does taste like a handful of different flavored gummy bears, but it also has a strong off note that’s like rubbery wheat. Like eating a wheat bread & gummy bear sandwich inside a rubber factory. **TRASH 9**
