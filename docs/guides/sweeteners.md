## Overview

In this FAQ, we'll go over the most commonly used sweeteners, what they're made of, and what they're best used for.

## Safety

Unfortunately, most of the commonly used sweeteners in foods are not safe to vape. Things like fructose, glucose, dextrose, and their derivatives tend to caramelize at vaping temperatures, producing unhealthy vapor and leaving behind thick black gunk on your coils.

The artificial sweetener sucralose is more temperature-stable than these common sugars, so it has risen to prominence as the sweetener for vaping. Note that it's still unclear if sucralose is a healthy thing to be vaping long-term, but it's almost certainly better than vaping simple sugars.
