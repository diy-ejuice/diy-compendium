# Finding Recipes

&gt; Some people prefer to do everything themselves, which makes perfect sense if you know what DIY stands for. But for everyone else (and especially new mixers) making recipes that others have crafted is not only their preference, it’s also the most sensible way to get started. But how do you decide where to to start and which recipes are worth buying the flavors to make?

## Knowing what you like…

Probably one of the most obvious ways to start, is to just think about the flavor profiles that you’ve tried and which ones were most palate pleasing.

-   Have you vaped commercial juice that you enjoyed?
-   How do you like (them) apples? Cherries? Mangoes?
-   [Does the aroma of pipe tobacco get you going](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/123495#true_kentucky_by_chemicalburnvictim)?
-   [Do you love desserts all up in your face without the calories](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/37647#golden_oreo_pudding_by_deejay_mills)?
-   [Would you like a cookie](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/10644#simple_sugar_cookie_by_id10_t)?
-   [Do you want to taste something abstract that doesn’t exist](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/116376#gigi_by_cob)?
-   [Do you like Pina Coladas](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/6352#if_you_like_pina_coladas_by_id10_t)?

There’s a recipe for all of those things and more.

## Descriptions

It’s actually pretty common to see descriptions and notes in recipes but far more common to see recipes that either have no description at all or just something that’s trying to sell you on the idea with a bunch of adjectives. And that’s fine for buying juice (I guess) but not so helpful when buying ingredients to mix your own. What you want to look for is why; why do these flavors work in the recipe and why should you buy them? If they’re using one strawberry out of the hundred strawberries available and it’s one you don’t have, why buy it if they aren’t describing its role in the recipe? The same applies to all the other flavors.

&gt; Probably the safest bet for flavors to buy outside of finding recipes first. Luckily you can still check out some of the recipes that can be made with those flavors to make sure it lines up with

## Commercial Recipes

Professional eliquid makers more often than not start as avid DIY enthusiasts. Some of those professionals are kind enough to share recipes when they close shop or discontinue selling a flavor and some of them even go as far as sharing recipes that they still sell. So if you’re chasing that “Premium” taste, look no further:

## Oneshots

More than a few people will claim oneshots are “Not real DIY” but, well, that’s not really true. All a oneshot is doing is making it so that instead of adding 5 separate flavors into your bottle you’re adding 1. The downside is that typically the recipe in that bottle is not disclosed and the only customization you can get out of it is adjusting the percentage of flavor up or down. Aside from that and the fact that creating or mixing other people’s recipes with individual concentrates is ultimately cheaper… oneshots are just recipes in a bottle and one of the simplest ways to start.

## The Clones

A relatively common entry point to DIY is the desire to make rather than buy premium juice, while not missing out on the signature flavor of the brand you love. Unfortunately commercial recipes (aside from the ones above) are well kept secrets and no matter how much effort is made to clone them “spot on” ends up being as subjective as flavor itself.

## Finding Recipes Here

[Monthly Recipe Threads](http://diyejuice.org/l/monthly)

## But wait, there’s more!

So now that you’ve picked out some recipes, purchased a bunch of flavors, probably added a few to the cart that just looked appealing and ultimately received all your supplies and mixed up some juice… you’re done, right? No, of course not.

You made a few small bottles and while one was really good, a couple were OK and one of them needs to steep for 6 months. The really good one is great and all, but you didn’t get into this for one recipe and you still have 15 other flavors for the OK recipes. You looked at a bunch more recipes but you’re coming up 2-10 flavors short. What now?

### [Suggest a recipe for my flavors!](http://diyejuice.org/l/suggest)

&gt; This is a thread posted every week on Friday where you can drop the whole list of your flavors or even just a selection of your stash that you’re interested in getting suggestions for.

### What can I make? (ATF &amp; ELR)

&gt; Both ATF and ELR have a feature called “What can I make?” that will allow you to see all the public recipes you’re able to make with the flavors you have (once you enter them in on the site)

### [Crazy Eliquid Machine](https://www.crazyeliquidmachine.com/)

&gt; This is just a fun way to generate a random recipe either from random flavors or, if you register, your own stash. Mixers discretion is advised.

### [ATF Random Recipe](https://alltheflavors.com/my/recipes/random)

&gt; Same concept as the CEM but generated from your stash and average usage percentages of the flavors.
