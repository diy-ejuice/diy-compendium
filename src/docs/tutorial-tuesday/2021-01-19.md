Morning Mixers,

Today, I want to talk about building blocks for recipes. I had a really fun time doing Noted Episode [130: Blessed Trinities](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtGmAO5aJdI) almost a year ago. Was also my first time on any kind of show and -- yeah -- ignore the pixelation. I have since learned to use video chat (thank you, 2020).

## What exactly is a Trinity?

A Trinity is a stone, base or layer that has 3 ingredients to make a complete profile. That’s it.

## Why use a Trinity?

Trinities are helpful for (new mixers as well as old) to use a building block to eliminate some guesswork in making a final mix.

## How does a combination even become a Trinity?

Well, here you can blame two people: u/EdibleMalfuntion and u/Apexified. The first baby jesus was the Edible Blueberry Trinity born on October 28th, 2016: [Blueberry Cinnamon Pastry v2](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/17883#blueberry_cinnamon_pastry_v2_0_by_ediblemalfunction). 4 years old! Can you believe it?!? Still good. This spawned the trend of calling it the Blueberry Trinity which then begat the slew of [Blessed Trinities](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/b5cf3k/diy_digest_vii_the_blessed_trinities/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) led by Apex. Later it was requested to be a [Flavor of the Week](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/ebx67m/are_you_cool_with_blessed_trinities_being_flavor/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) by yours truly and away we go!

## How do I use a Trinity?

Here you have some great starter blocks that have been un/officially approved by the greater diy community to hit the right notes to flesh out the suggested profile. They don’t always work together, and they’re not perfect for everyone, but they do what they have what it takes to get you going. Stack ‘em, blend ‘em, play with them. Do what you please, it’s DIY and only you have to vape it!

## How has anyone used a Trinity?

Jim Morrison said it well: “This is the best part of the trip. This is the trip. The best part. I really like.” Here’s a few examples (anything in the comments will be added to this list!):

## Comments:

1. Which is your favorite existing recipe that features a Trinity?
2. How have you used a Trinity or modified it?
3. Do you have a replacement (or sub for the missing flavor) for the Blackberry Trinity?
4. Opinion: Is the WF Island Mango needed in the Mango Trinity?
5. Any new combos for us to try for a profile that hasn’t been ‘approved’ yet? (Gin Trinity anyone?)
6. Any Blessed Trinities that need to be knocked down a notch or reworked?

I’m pooped. Help me out in the comments with recipes and ideas!

Keep mixin’ and keep sharin’,

Edit: After having done (most of) the research for this post, I realized that the Daveberry Trinity is actually dated _prior to_ the Blueberry Trinity on atf by about a month. It was Ed's that was recognized and named as a Trinity first, leading to subsequent names like Daveberry Trinity.
