# Nicotine Storage

by [/u/duncanyoyo1](https://www.reddit.com/user/duncanyoyo1)

With the state of vaping being what it is in the United States and other countries around the world, it's more important than ever to store your nicotine base properly. This guide should help you understand the best practices to store your nicotine long term ( Years ).

### The enemy of nicotine is oxidation. 

### What causes oxidation?

**Well firstly**, exposure to oxygen. A lot of manufacturers will have to expose the nicotine to oxygen during the manufacturing process, thus beginning the process of oxidation.
Some vendors will use a supercritical gas to remove the nicotine from the tobacco plant, without exposing it to oxygen. ( There are more steps involved but it is not important for what we are talking about )

Either way, you will eventually need to open and use your nicotine bases. And inevitably expose them to oxygen.

**The second** cause of oxidation is exposure to light, UV light especially.
Exposure to UV light will cause the nicotine to begin to oxidize and break down almost immediately.

**And the final** cause of oxidation is heat. As well as changes in temperature.
Oxidation occurs more rapidly the hotter it is, conversely, the colder it is the slower oxidation happens. 
Having constant temperature fluctuations is not great for storage either, ideally you want as little fluctuation in temperature as possible.

The best way to keep nicotine from oxidizing is to keep it in an amber glass bottle, in a freezer (-20C is the preferred temperature for long term storage).
The amber glass will prevent UV light and oxygen from getting to the nicotine in the bottle, and keeping it in the freezer will slow any reaction happening.

### But what about that pesky oxygen in the bottle?

Well that is where using Argon for preserving nicotine can be beneficial. It is a noble gas and does not react with nicotine, PG or VG, and more importantly it is heavier than air, so it will naturally displace any environmental gasses (By volume, dry air contains 78.09% nitrogen, 20.95% oxygen, 0.93% argon, 0.04% carbon dioxide).
This will help keep the amount of oxygen as low as possible. 

The best practice is to decant your nicotine into storage bottles ( For example, use 4x the size of your working bottle, so you only have to open any given bottle 4 times. Smaller is also fine if you have the space. ) and top them with argon. 

You can find it frequently sold as a wine preservative, but make sure you get the pure argon one. Not the mixed gas one. ( Nitrogen can turn your nic base pink but otherwise shouldn't affect it )

All you have to do is spray it for a few seconds in your bottle. Since it is heavier than air it will displace the air in the bottle and create a layer of protection from oxygen.

Keep a working bottle of nicotine handy for mixing, like a 60ml amber PET bottle, but you can use a smaller bottle depending on how much you mix and what nic level you use. PET or glass is preferred. Store it in a cool, dark place. Out of direct light.
Then when you need to refill your working bottle, you can fill it and re-top your storage bottle with argon. 

You could also choose to store it in smaller amber glass bottles, like a 30ml. That way you can just take one out as you need them.
The down side of this is it takes up much more volume, so you need a lot more space in your freezer.

All of these things will help ensure your nicotine bases are good to use for years and years to come.
