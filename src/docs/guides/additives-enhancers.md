In the world of vaping flavors everything is subjective and when it comes to additives and their effects on flavors, the subjectivity grows exponentially, compounding the problem of second-hand anecdotal experience. **All of these additives have a sweet spot for their "optimal" effects but most have a thin line between no effect and (typically) muting flavor.**

Just because a concentrate says "Honey" on the label doesn't mean you'll taste honey and the same goes for the Magic and Wizardry on the labels below, along with their purported effects on your flavors and recipes&hellip; Take the the following advice and descriptions with a drop of saline and don't get salty if your results vary.

Its action last 5-8 seconds and involve only the acid receptors."                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

Also common in tobacco/RY4 recipes. Used from .25-.5% it carries some notes of caramel, nuts, and butter. When used at higher percentages it can transform into corn chips/Fritos.                                                                                                                                                                                     |

Commonly reported to enhance flavors initially but diminish the overall flavor after a short period of time (days vs weeks)                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

|                   **Citric Acid (CA**                   |                                                                                                        Commonly used to enhance fruits or make them "pop" but will quickly mute your recipe when abused. In [/u/fizzmustard](https://www.reddit.com/u/fizzmustard)'s famous ‘Nana Cream clone it was used at 1 drop per ml but was later changed "I no longer recommend using citric acid in this recipe; it tends to mute the flavor over time and isn't very gentle on coils. Up to you whether you use it or not. I personally don't."                                                                                                         |
|                **Distilled Water (DW)**                 |                                       Was more useful on older devices when using higher VG in mixes and isn't as common today, due to most RTA's and even prebuilt coils being capable of handing Max VG. Some people claim to get better flavor and others claim that it mutes flavor, which can probably be explained by adding more DW than is necessary to increase wicking. [/u/\_Yodai](https://www.reddit.com/u/_Yodai) [explains some of the science](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/4cqj9w/80_vg20_h2o_base_weird_almost_moldy_taste/d1ksqzx/) behind the viscosity of water vs PG.                                       |
|         **Ethyl Maltol (AKA TFA Cotton Candy)**         | Is not a sweetener in the traditional sense of adding sweetness (sweet lips) but conveys sweetness through your olfactory, so it's effectiveness as a sweetener can vary quite a bit depending on the sensitivity of your palate. It can also alter sour/bitter flavors by taming the inherently harsh top notes. And in this case tame is almost interchangeable with mute; EM used as an additive will cause muting when used too high or when used in conjunction with flavors that already contain EM or Maltol (e.g. TFA Strawberry, Bavarian Cream, [and many more](https://shop.perfumersapprentice.com/specsheetlist.aspx?cas=4940-11-8)) |
|                   **Ethyl Vanillin**                    |                                  2-5x stronger than Vanillin depending on your source of information. [/u/clinodev](https://www.reddit.com/u/clinodev) has [some notes on usage, layering and sweetness](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/2zb6aq/difference_between_vanillin_and_ethyl_vannilin/cphh673/). Recommended percentages are old, as are most well regarded recipes using it. Also worth noting it is a component of [over 100](https://shop.perfumersapprentice.com/specsheetlist.aspx?cas=121-32-4) TFA flavors, so adding it to those flavors is likely to speed up olfactory fatigue.                                   |

Add it to eliquid starting at 2% to ascertain your preference."                                                                                                                                           |

## Flavors used as additives

"Anything can be used as an additive in the right circumstance&hellip;" [/u/Botboy141](https://www.reddit.com/u/Botboy141)

Basically any time someone uses a flavor to "add" something other than the flavor it is supposed to be, we can consider it an additive. I'm not sure where you draw the line between using a cream as a cream flavor and using it to enhance the mouthfeel. There's a lot of room for subjectivity due to the fact that people's sensitivity to flavors means that while one person might find a low percentage of FA Pear adds juiciness to their recipe, others might might taste an overripe pear note that detracts from the main profile they're after. Consensus is just a line that divides a full spectrum of experience and while that line can often be broad enough to leave a small subset of outliers it can also, on occasion, leave a large minority wondering what everyone else is thinking.

|   **FLV Lovage**    |                   "This is more of a flavor additive than stand alone. The review on the Flavorah website states that it "tones" flavors, and that seems as good a description as any. It seems to round out and give volume to green flavors, for better or worse.

| **CAP Jelly Candy** | "Solo, this has a light soapy taste. Not super dense but really fluffy mouthfeel. Little bit of residual stickiness. But this isn't a flavor, per se.

### Effervescence

Real carbonation is caused by dissolving carbon dioxide gas into liquid under pressure. When the pressure is reduced, carbon dioxide is released from the liquid in the form of effervescence.

Our best hope in replicating this sensation is to create a convincing illusion of carbonation, or something that our brains associate so closely with carbonation that our imagination bridges the gap.

- VT Fizzy Sherbet &mdash; Is the new kid on the block and hasn't been reviewed yet, so I asked [/u/ID10-T](https://www.reddit.com/u/ID10-T) what he thought of it "has some lemony citrus flavor to work around but it does the best job of anything I've tried at emulating the tingle of carbonation. 2% Fizzy S 3% CAP Lemon Lime = Sprite"
- FLV Citrus Soda &mdash; this is a newer addition to the group and its a bit more potent than VT Fizzy Sherbet.

### My generic advice on using additives/enhancers

I'll paraphrase both the typical new mixer "What additives should I get on my first order?" and the typical seasoned mixer "None."

I don't disagree with that advice but I'll also contradict myself when asserting that you should find recipes that are well regarded (highly rated) or have awesome descriptions and look like a lot of time was spent developing them (none of mine) and if any of those use additives, well, you should probably get them.

Before ordering or reaching for an additive to use in your own mix, ask yourself "What are you trying to accomplish?"

**"It's better to fix the issue at hand then try to get around it."** &mdash; Phillip Rocke

If you're trying to fix your mix with an additive it's worth noting there is no one-size-fits-all solution to a failed recipe. It's far better to have a well rounded knowledge of handful of flavors than to have a toolbox full of tools you don't understand how to use and it's much more beneficial in the long run to learn to balance flavors by themselves than to add a bit of magic in order to mask the problems.

But experimentation is fun and additives and enhancers can make things more interesting, so if you DIY as a hobby, grab all the additives that sound interesting, and if you DIY to save money&mdash;save it, they're not a vital component of good juice.
