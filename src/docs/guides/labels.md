# Labels

> Labels are great for anything from adding a touch of flair to a recipe you’re proud of or a simple utilitarian approach of having the name, date, and nic content visible on the bottle. How far you go and how much time/money you spend depends on how important it is to you. At the very least, you should be able to identify what’s in the bottle and when it was made or you run the risk of trying to clone one of your own recipes after you try that blank bottle of absolutely delicious eliquid that you don’t remember making.

Starting from the cheapest option and moving up:

**Sharpie**

Almost too simple. Just write directly on the bottle and if it’s handy and you feel like it, cover it up with some clear tape to make it last longer.

**Masking Tape**

Another simple solution is rip off a strip of masking tape and jot down the details. It’s typically easy to remove (especially if you use painters tape) and a roll will last a long time.

> The above are the simplest, most obvious, and require the least amount of effort. Boring.

**Sticker Labels**

A pack of plain white [all purpose labels](http://a.co/5Yo0JxN) will only set you back a couple dollars and at least gives you something flat and easier to write on. If you’re feeling creative you can give your mixes [name tags](http://a.co/072SJ4t) or go for more of a [vintage style](http://a.co/13704lA).

**Thermal Printers**

Sticking with the ascending price order is difficult with thermal printers as they hang out in the range of $20 to $200+ so if you already have an inkjet/laser printer, sheet labels would be cheaper in the short term.

The biggest benefit in using a thermal printer is the lack of ink and the ability to quickly print off one label at a time.

On the low end of the price range ($20-$30) you have things like the Dymo LetraTag and the Brother P-Touch that use label tape of various colors and material but are limited to a few lines of text and clipart. On the plus side they are small, portable and battery operated. You can pack all the necessary information as long as you [keep it simple](https://i.imgur.com/qQL6zMH.jpg).

The mid range ($70-$100) has options like the Dymo LabelWriter 450 and Brother QL-800 which have a larger assortment of label sizes and [materials](https://i.imgur.com/4SxMwfL.jpg) and allow you to print [pictures](https://i.imgur.com/V05HIjw.jpg) as well as text.

**Printable Sheet Labels**

This is the most customizable options from the size of the labels to the materials and, of course, color being an option. It’s the only option if you want your DIY labels to look “[premium](https://i.imgur.com/WkGvyYW.jpg)”.

This is easily the best option if you already own a printer and want full color labels. Places like onlinelabels.com offer every conceivable option for printable blank labels from metallic foil to weatherproof polyester in pretty much any dimension you could need.

On the budget side a pack of 300 plain address labels will only set you back about $5 or about 2 pennies per label and offer most of the same benefits, minus being water/juice proof.
