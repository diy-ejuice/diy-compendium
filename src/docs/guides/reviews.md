# Recipe Reviews

Recipe feedback and review is probably the most important part of our community outside of flavor notes. It let’s us know what the community thinks about our creation, affirms or denies mixing tricks we may be attempting, raises alarms about steeping issues, and warns us of problems that certain people who may taste things differently will have with our recipes.

The trends with feedback and reviews seem to play out in specific ways. Some very helpful, but others really very unhelpful.

The trends I see are:

1.  **All aboard the bandwagon**  – This trend happens when a popular mixer gets reviews from their group/clique/audience with resounding glowing remarks and 5 stars from just about everyone. Regardless of issues with the recipe, muddiness after steeping, sweetener used to cover off notes, etc, there’s usually very little negative feedback. Equally annoying are the comments like “I haven’t mixed this yet but it looks banging! Thanks fam!” These reviews are seriously unhelpful, unnecessarily boost the popularity of the mixer/recipe, and deceive new mixers into mixing them because of their high rating. Boo! Just because you have a YouTube channel, are featured on a podcast, or are really active in the community, it doesn’t always mean that you know what you’re doing.
2.  **Unconstructive poo flinging**  – These are generally in the form of “This sucks!”, “These percentages are way too high are you crazy?”, and “I haven’t mixed this but it looks terrible.” Not only are these not helpful, they make the reviewer look like a jealous asshat. A negative review is generally received better if you provide some detail about why you don’t like the mix and provide some constructive criticism.
3.  **The non review**  – There are two classes of non reviews in my opinion. The first is obviously when someone mixes a recipe and doesn’t take the time to leave a review or forgets to leave a review. This is disappointing because reviews are what make us all better. The second non review class is a negative non review. For whatever reason some people are afraid to leave negative feedback. It could be because they don’t want to piss people off and be “black balled” by the community or because the mixer is a popular personality and everyone else seems to enjoy the recipe. This is even more disappointing to me. If you have a negative review and leave constructive feedback, there should be no reason that it will ruffle any feathers. Negative feedback is often more valuable than positive feedback. Just be constructive about it.
4.  **Critical review gold**  – The last is the best, a well thought out reviews that outline exactly why a recipe is good, what techniques you’re impressed with, and any suggestions or constructive criticism you may may have. The criticism is usually subjective in the form of alternative flavor suggestions, percentage tweaks, steeping problems, or personal palate issues with certain ingredients. These reviews are probably the most rewarding for both parties. Not only do you get to stroke the ego of a fellow mixer, you also get to help them improve their mix/ability by providing much needed constructive criticism. Not every mix is perfect and we all usually have ideas for improvement. Share them!

Unbiased, constructive criticism is priceless in our craft. As far as I’m concerned, I really do want to know “the good, the bad, and the ugly” as it pertains to my creations. All opinions whether positive or negative are welcome as long as they help me improve. I’m a big boy and I have a whole drawer full of big boy panties. This criticism helps me to be a better mixer and understand how others taste and perceive my mixes. If you love (or hate) something I’ve created, tell me so, and tell me why, in specific details. Even if you think I’m crazy and should probably cut my tongue out and burn it (but don’t say that, be nice).

So I’ll leave you with this… If you take the time to mix something please also take the time to review it. Good or bad, terrible or mind blowing, review it and remember to be constructive and provide something of value to that mixer. It’s the least you can do for someone that shared their work with the community.

**Bonus**: a couple of YouTube channels are doing reviews of recipes and mixers. [TheFogVlog](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1W5UVScPHoFyJO3o8S-YSg) is reviewing several recipes from a mixer at a time. [Hibbadoray](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFJiizdsKmPufY39iKGAz8w) is reviewing recipes. I think both are making wonderful contributions to the community. Check them out if you have the time.
