# Organization

## Not gonna bury the lede, [here’s a gallery](https://imgur.com/a/WHhTG) with 50+ mixing setups for inspiration

**Workflow**

The two most logical methods of organization are alphabetical and by profile/category. As far as the methods of storage, some people like [queuetue](https://www.reddit.com//r/DIY_eJuice/comments/3odkmr/my_latest_attempt_at_organization/) and [coop34](http://imgur.com/a/YH9ZW) like to keep their flavors sealed away in bins and out of sight while others like myself and most of the mixing setups you’ll see in the gallery, like to have everything on display and easily accessible. It all depends on whether you have a dedicated space to mix or you’re stuck using whatever flat surface is available for a temporary laboratory. 

  

[Acrylic nail polish racks](http://a.co/cM6DcdJ) are one of the most common recommendations for those who have the space but if you don’t then this nail polish [Carrying Case](http://a.co/bbr8Lhz) will keep your flavors visible and can still be stored away when not in use. Or if you have the skills you can [DIY your own storage](https://redd.it/4pne22) like that guy or [this guy](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/5m45cm/too_many_flavors_how_do_you_organize/dc1lmh7/). Personally I’m too lazy for all that and would rather just buy solutions to my problems…

**Keeping base flavors separate and easily accessible**

If you’re like me you’ll find yourself reaching for some of the same flavors time and time again in order to build the foundation of a recipe, or when testing new flavors you might have a go to flavor pairing e.g. a new fruit to add to VBIC or FLV Cream

Some flavors just lend themselves to more use. Those flavors I buy in larger bottles and rebottle into smaller ones so that I can keep them within reach for quickly mixing up a new idea.  

  

**Digital Organization**

[All The Flavors](https://alltheflavors.com/) and [Hotrod’s JuiceCalculator](http://diyjuicecalculator.com/) both have the ability to track inventory and will reduce the amount you have on hand with each batch that you make. It does require some setup and is a lot easier to manage if you start using the feature before your collection has grown into something ridiculous and worthy of being featured on the show Hoarders. 

All The Flavors also allows you to add flavors to your stash by forwarding your order emails from several of the popular vendors and automagically fills out the price and quantity for you. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Shelf life**

This really only becomes a concern if you buy in quantities that exceed practical use. i.e. don’t buy 4oz of a flavor you’ve never tried. Also don’t buy more than you can try before the next time you buy. 

Taking notes is important in general but especially practical when it comes to understanding the lifespan of your flavors. If a concentrate expires or sits around unused long enough to ‘go off’ it probably wasn’t something you needed anyway and if you took notes on day one, then you’ll be able to note the change on day 100. Without notes you might end up using an old concentrate in a recipe and fail to understand why it’s not turning out how the creator described it and/or how other people reviewed it. 

If a flavor is really good but really concentrated and you see yourself using it a lot but not enough to consume the entire bottle within 6-12 months, consider rebottling it in glass (and even rebottling as a dilution) in order to extend its shelf life. 

Some flavors degrade and others degrade with style. Bavarian Cream, in my experience, gets darker and richer, fuller tasting and almost more potent. That, however, is not the case for the vast majority of flavors. In my experience, most of them just lose potency over time and even that takes longer than a 10ml will typically last.

Hopefully this gives you some ideas for your own setup. Mine is always evolving based on the ideas I see other people come up with and whatever random method seems brilliant this week. Ultimately, for me at least, it’s just another fun aspect of this hobby. **Feel free to share you setup and any novel ideas/techniques you’ve come up with for organizing your flavors and mixing space.**
