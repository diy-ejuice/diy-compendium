# Flavor of the Week

As always, the purpose of this thread is to gather the community to explore a category of flavor and its many uses. And it’s also to have [**FUN!**](https://imgur.com/g1Kgpr3)

Post recipes containing this week’s Flavor of the Week, as the star or in a supporting role, with or without development notes. Talk about other people’s recipes that use it. Compare and contrast different manufacturers’ versions of the FOTW. Ask for help using that flavor in general or to achieve something specific, offer advice, brainstorm ideas, consider substitutions, suggest pairings… really anything at all as long as it’s on topic.
