It seems like every day, I see someone ask a question that's followed by at least one of the following responses&hellip;

- You should check the **FOTW** posts
- Have you watched the **Noted** episode on that?
- Did you know that there's a **Flavor Review** for that?

That's because these resources provide incredibly valuable information that people like our friend ID10-T have created to "give back" to the DIY community.

Unfortunately, far too many people are eager to be "takers" and are not as enthusiastic about being "givers". That leaves the entire DIY community relying on a small handful of people to do all the heavy lifting. That quite often forces some of the more experienced mixers to stop participating in the discussion. And that means we **ALL** lose.

Here's a few things you should keep in mind&hellip;

- **Put some effort in BEFORE you ask for help**

There's a reason the acronym **FAQ** exists - because (regardless of the subject) people ask the same things over and over and over. It really does get annoying. If you're brand new, almost all of your questions have already been answered many times. So many times in fact that the Wiki here is filled with answers to those questions. Please take the time to do a tiny bit of reading before posting. You might be surprised that while you're looking for the answer to _Question A_, you find _Question B_, _Question C_, _Question D_, etc. that you haven't even thought to ask yet.

The recent Flavor Bans have brought a horde of new mixers into the fold and with then an endless wave of newbie questions, That means these (already answered) questions push much of the good info (like the FOTW post) off of the front page very quickly. That makes some of the folks that contribute helpful info to think "what's the point of posting?" when their message is blown off the front page by posts like this =&gt; _"I'm new - tell me everything I need to do."_ If you don't think that happens very often, check out the reddit-diy-posts channel on the [DIY_eJuice Discord Server](https://discord.gg/dUsMehj). You can see what's been posted even after our axe-wielding Moderator /u/EdibleMalfunction has zapped it. I think Ed would rather be chatting with the folks on Discord than wading through a pile of*"low effort shitposts"* trying to keep the front page clean.

- **You don't have to be an _Expert_ to contribute**

If you're unfamiliar with my contribution - I'm the buffoon that volunteered to create [Flavor Facts](https://link.diyejuice.org/Facts000). When I started, I had only been mixing my own juice for a few months. Even now my flavor stash barely exceeds 100 flavors - so I am not even in the same zip code as the experts. But it doesn't mean that I can't contribute something. And now, ID10-T actually ask for MY opinion on things (hahaha). I guess he's really trying to earn his status as an **IDIOT**! (hahaha)

The lovely u/GlassChalice468 (aka Dragon Lady) joined the Mixer Showdown after an incredibly short time mixing and helped create [Golden Snozzberry Custard](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/155578#golden_snozzberry_custard_by_diy_discord) which u/ID10-T nominated for*"Recipe of the Year"*. And considering his track record at picking winners, don't be surprised if it wins.

- **Don't be intimidated**

Remember that all of the people you view as "Experts" are &hellip; people! There's no reason to feel intimidated. They may know more about mixing eJuice than you do, but that doesn't mean that they're unapproachable. Hell, most of them are extremely friendly and helpful. They're not only willing to talk about DIY, they also have "regular lives" just like the rest of us normal folks. I had the pleasure to chat with several of the "Notable Names" of the DIY World while organizing the _Mixer Showdowns_. At first I assumed that I would be "bowing in reverence" to their greatness. But what I found was that they're **ALL** incredibly easy to talk to. Here's a few things that I learned &hellip;

- u/ConcreteRiver is a Jolly Big Boy that will gladly share his wealth of knowledge. But hide all of your fruit before chatting with him. And if he starts to take his shirt off - **RUN!** (grin)

- u/AlfredPudding is truly the RainMan of the DIY Community. And he's very friendly. He bent over backward to help me recruiting for the Mixer Showdown. Thanks again Alf!

- u/mlNikon is the lovable Sweetheart we all know from Noted. She puts up with ID10-T's shennanigans and keeps the boys in check. She also chose her screenname to take a jab at Wayne (the DIY or Die guy).

- u/NaChef is not only a good mixer - he's a musician. (Keyboard - in case you're wondering) Check him out [**HERE**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_tXLEQv_aE&ytbChannel=null)

- u/matthewkocanda (aka CokeCan) tries to pose as a social malcontent, but put him in front of a Monopoly board and he turns into a little kid.

- u/Kittybit8 is a guy - not a girl! (hahaha) Sorry about that one Kitty!

- u/folkart2000 is actually is very accomplished craftsman. [Take a look.](http://www.steveabeepottery.com/). And for the record, he does NOT have an accent, he talks normally. It's all of the rest of you that have accents. Southern Boys gotta stick together - right folkart? (grin)

- u/Tamberina1 (aka TamVapes) is a [SURVIVOR](https://www.flavorah.com/featured-mixer-tam-vapes/).

- u/CheebaSteeba - If you take an Uber and hear "Delosi - it's delightfully mediocre - use at 5%" your driver probably has a beard and wears glasses. (smirk)

- u/HocusKrokus (aka Kopel) is not only the expert on floral vapes, he also adopted [Steven King's dog](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/533064018743656451/573559275570331648/received_2066505626770462.png) (hahaha)

- u/Drunklordgg - (aka JERRY) is still waiting for CokeCan to give his sweater back.

- u/Queuetue (the ATF Guy) is actually a VERY generous dude.

- u/xGRANITEx - (aka Silky) hails from Chicago and claims to have taught Alfred everything he knows. I seriously doubt that, but The Silk Man makes [some mighty fine juice](https://alltheflavors.com/users/Silky?sort_order=rating&name_like=).

- u/Apexified tries hard to imitate the Wizard of Oz. If you listen closely you can hear him saying "Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain". But just take a quick survey the FAQ's in the wiki and you'll notice that 90% of them are written by one person &hellip; I wonder who that could be? (smirk)

If these people will talk to (and greatly help) a neophyte like me, surely they'll talk to you too. So don't be scared. Just remember to be polite and **ASK**, don't **DEMAND**. I think you'll be happy that you did.

Now that I've rambled off topic for too long (smirk) let me state a few facts about the topic at hand - **Noted** and **FOTW**. I have cataloged virtually everything that has transpired on Noted and FOTW (along with several other sources of info about flavors). You can see the result [HERE](https://link.diyejuice.org/Facts000). I this is what I know &hellip;

Noted has produced 135 episodes that are each an hour long (often longer). That's the same as talking about flavors for an entire month on a job (8hrs/day - 5days/week)

Noted has generated over 3,000 unique descriptions of individual flavors.

This week's FOTW (Papaya) is almost the last of the flavor categories that I could find that Noted has NOT covered. The upcoming episode on Toffee should just about finish off the possible flavors for FOTW unless you include the obscure nooks and crannies like Wine or Cream Soda.

You've probably seen the weekly "Single Flavor Test" threads posted by /u/RancerDS . Have you noticed that in (almost) all of them, our good friend ID10-T has added an incredible "Flavor RoundUp" for the previous FOTW? He provides a concise flavor review on each of the flavors that appear on Noted. Check out his latest submission with **46** versions of Orange =&gt; [**ID10-T's Orange RoundUp**](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/et1f7f/single_flavor_results/fffp8z8/)

The list of things u/ID10-T has contributed to the DIY Community is too long to add to this already too long message. But you can see many of them here =&gt; [DIY Digest XXVI: The ID10-T Edition](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/df04h6/diy_digest_xxvi_the_id10t_edition/)

We don't want to lose something as good as this do we? I implore everyone reading this to please "give a little back". At the very least post a "thank you" and upvote this thread. Let those that give the most know that we appreciate their effort and want them to continue.

## TL;DR

DIY stands for **DO IT YOURSELF**. But none of us are completely doing it on our own. We all rely on each other's experiences and insights to help learn and improve our mixing skills.

Take all you want, but be sure to **GIVE SOME BACK**!
