BEST isn't very easy to quantify but I'll try anyway because this is definitely a Frequently Asked Question. If you ask someone here what's the BEST cookie, they'll probably ask "For what?"

And that's the problem with every ranked list of flavors from "My First Order" flavors to ATF and ELR's lists of the most popular flavors--they're a popularity contest sorted by how often they appear in recipes and not by how well they work for what you might want them to do.

[Scottes777](http://forum.e-liquid-recipes.com/u/Scottes777) over on the ELR forums did an awesome/epic write up on "[**Analyzing The 100 Top-Rated Recipes**](http://forum.e-liquid-recipes.com/t/analyzing-the-100-top-rated-recipes/83979)" It's a few months shy of 2 years old but is still an interesting look at what it takes to make all those recipes and how far each flavor will get you.

If you're here in the sub for a minute you'll see all kinds of people, including myself, recommend finding highly rated recipes (preferably ones that look good to you) and buying the flavors to make those, rather than just buying flavors either randomly or sorting "Best sellers" on whatever vendor you're using, or picking up flavors that sound good.

This is a very similar take on Scottes idea, a remix if you will, but instead I'll be using 50 of the top rated recipes on ATF and the highest voted recipes in the Monthly Recipe Thread's for the last year.

I won't be able to hit every data point that he did because I'm not using a program to analyze the recipes like he did but the goal is to put together a list of flavors that will get you the best bang for your buck and allow you to mix up the most top rated recipes from the sub and ATF.

## Starting from the Top Flavors

If you were to buy just the [Top 20 flavors from ATF](https://alltheflavors.com/flavors/top100) you would be able to make a whopping 29 recipes. Of those 29 recipes 9 have been rated more than 1 time and have 4 stars or more with a total of 127 ratings. 4 of those 9 recipes are in the top 50 recipes on ATF. Buying all 20 flavors would set you back $35.88 and mixing up 30ml of each of the 9 highest rated recipes would cost $5.81 in flavors.

Not a bad start. And with one of the coolest features of ATF ["What can I make?" +1](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes?sort_order=new&owner=all&suggestions=2&name_like=), that lets you see what you could make with your current stash if you added 1 more flavor, the total number of recipes jumps from 29 to 144-- of course, that doesn't mean just buying 1 more flavor gets you all of those extra recipes, it just means you're only missing 1 from each of them. For example: When sorting those +1 recipes by rating, 6 of the 10 highest rated require 6 new flavors and 5 of those are in the top 100 flavors.

And if you were really ambitious and bought all 100 of the top flavors, you'd be able to mix up 350 recipes and 21 of the top 50 recipes. You'd also be +1 flavor away from 1159 recipes but let's be honest, you just spent \$215 on flavors, maybe it's time to take a break.

## The Top 50 recipes

In order to make all 50 of the top rated recipes you would need 132 different flavors. 74 of those flavors would only be used once, leaving 58 flavors that are used in 2 or more recipes. But just having those 58 flavors would allow you to make 10 of the top 50 recipes.

&hellip; And 70 recipes total with 50 of those rated 4 stars or more (312 reviews in all) and this would set you back about \$133.

[**Here's a list**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18Lvxxn8j0mJBpjDJRhakIyO7GueRb8EW3nAJUOHSPnA/edit?usp=sharing) of all the flavors you would need for those recipes.

## The DIY_eJuice BEST

"[My First Order](http://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/first_order_flavors)" Flavors from the sidebar gives you 20 flavors voted on by all of us here as the best way to start and even includes a few recipes that you can make with them. ATF returns a solid but not quite astonishing 48 recipes with those flavors in your stash. But if you want to make the most upvoted recipes from the monthly recipe threads, you're gonna need a bigger flavor stash.

Those 12 recipes require 62 flavors and only 9 of those are shared by more than 1 recipe. In order to get all those flavors you would need to spend at least \$169 between 3-4 vendors and in the end, you'd regret having OOO Pickle.

## The Conclusion

All the data in the world isn't going to come up with a list of flavors that will cater perfectly to your palate. I was hoping to put together a more definitive list that could maximize flavor buying efficiency but every which way you look at it you end up 1 or more flavors short of making the next best thing.

Making the most top rated recipes while buying the fewest flavors is still possible, you just have to find the ones that pique your interest and favorite them on ATF (click the little star next to the recipe name) and then you can go to the menu and click "Needed Flavors" to get a list of the flavors that aren't already in your stash.

I realized you need to be a pro member to favorite recipes so I decided to ask /u/queuetue (5 minutes ago) if he would do a **[Memorial Day free month of ATF](https://alltheflavors.com/go_pro)** and he said yes. So if you're not already a member and you want to try it out for free you can use the coupon **FAQ-MD-2018** for a free month of ATF. The code will work until Tuesday morning and is good for the first 100 people who use it.

If you're interested here are the spreadsheets I made to "analyze" the data.

[Top 50 Recipes](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1o8F3OobpQhdWoO8Wvt4XCj5iENE52zZdLNuoFhdiUko/edit?usp=sharing)

[Top 100 Flavors](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ofpZI2rnFTgwzvgS-t7dNmIC_Stv7Mur_Mhkdz8Pw9Q/edit?usp=sharing)

With the top 100 flavors you can sort the data to see things like which flavors are the cheapest when used at their average percentage or which flavors are in recipes with the most reviews, etc. Trivial but interesting stuff, I think.

Hopefully this can help you pick a few new flavors or help kick off your first order from one the the vendors doing [Memorial Day Sales](https://redd.it/8ly79u).
