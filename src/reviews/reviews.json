Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** CAP SilverLine 27 Bears, 2 and 5%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 6 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Pineapple heavy gummy bears, executed pretty well overall.\n\nTexture here is actually pretty solid.  Not quite as thick, dense, and chewy as 27 Fish, but it has that waxy thing from actual gummy bears down pretty well.  Actually feels like it coats your mouth with that halfway dissolved gelatin thing that a mouthful of gummy bears has going on.\n\nAnd it tastes like gummy bears. Mostly like white pineapple gummy bears.  There's some actual tartness here that could either be a tarter take on pineapple or more of a discrete orange flavor.  I'm also getting some sweeter strawberryish flavor in here too. The classic haribo flavors are raspberry, strawberry, lemon, orange, and pineapple... and I could definitely see all of those being in here but it's weighted more towards the pineapple and the citrus.\n\nThe only direct competition that I've had for this would be FW Gummy Candy, and this has a much better mouthfeel but it does have a pretty identifiable fruit flavored attached.  FW Gummy Candy has always sort of worked a bit better in theory than in practice for me, so while 27 bears might not theoretically be as versatile, It'll work better when the actual flavor of gummy bears isn't going to get in the way.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Not really, pretty much just gummy bears. Gets a bit chemical at high percentages, but nothing too bad within usable percentage ranges.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light to moderate.  I do get a bit of harshness on this, but it seems to settle in a bit moderately quickly and smooth back out.  Initially seems to dry out your mouth a bit and that might be contributing.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 2%, this is weaker.  I'm mostly getting a light candy pineapple.  Seems to be missing some of the other fruit accents in there. Texture is a little sticky, but it's more like a dry sticky and not that gelatinous gummy bear thing.\n\nFilled in quite a bit at 5%.  Still very much pineapple forward, but I'm picking up some extra citrus tartness and some \"red flavor\" way in the back. Flavor still feels like it could be maybe just a touch more saturated.\n\nTrying this up at 8%, I'm starting to find some of the chemical edges of this flavor.  The red part has filled in a bit but it's almost tasting a little too citrus heavier. Mouthfeel is dramatically better than 5%.\n\nJust based on these tests, I'd probably use this an accent flavor around 3% and a primary flavor around 6-7%. \n\n**Uses & Pairings:** A higher percentage of this concentrate, too much sweetener, and some questionable marketing and you've got yourself a hype flavor.  This could use maybe a bit more \"red\" to it with a candied strawberry or raspberry, and maybe some vanilla swirl to round the edges off, but pretty remarkably close to a single flavor gummy bear as it is.\n\nShould be useful as a slightly tart, gummy mouthfeel additive for more diverse candy profiles.  I don't think you're completely going to get away from the fruitiness here, but you can probably overwhelm it with your fruit flavor of choice especially at lower percentages.  The mouthfeel shows ups a bit later than than the fruit flavor, so it'll be fairly difficult to get a clear fruit flavor not already in that gummy bear spectrum and still get all of that mouthfeel.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  Still fairly new.\n\n[Shoutout to ceedee99uk for linking reviews from PeegoreVapes in another thread.](https://peegorevapes.wordpress.com/2017/10/04/capella-silver-line-affordable-flavours/)\n\n[Here's the product page from Capella.](http://www.capellaflavors.com/products/27-bears-flavor-concentrate.html)  Their description: \"Silverline’s new mystery jelly treat, 27 Bears will surely satisfy your inner sweet tooth.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** CAP SilverLine 27 Fishes, 2 and 5%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 5 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  A pretty solid, slightly muted Swedish Fish Flavor with a full mouthfeel.\n\nThe flavor here is definitely in the ballpark of swedish fish.  Tastes like an aggressively \"red\" candy.  Capella themselves calls out red licorice and raspberry, and I could definitely see either of those.  This does seem to have a bit more of a generic red licorice vibe than straight swedish fish.  I also pick up something that tastes a lot like an artificial bright red cherry as an accent.  Maybe missing just a light bit of tartness and deepness for an actual swedish fish, but it's definitely recognizable.\n\nThis actually has a pretty great mouthfeel.  Very dense and chewy, with some of that sticky waxiness from actual swedish fish.  Doesn't feel like a straight ahead gummy candy, whatever they're doing here mimics that half way between a jelly candy and gummy bear thing that actual swedish fish have.  Isn't a big chemical mess like most other candy texturizers.\n\nI do feel like this flavor could stand to be a bit more vibrant.  It feels a bit muted overall, like the flavor feels just a half-step in the background and is a bit hazy through that texture.  Might be fixable with some sweetener, but solo it feels like the flavor is struggling a bit against the texture here.  It tastes like a swedish fish, but it doesn't quite have that mouthwatering vibrancy of actual candy.  Just cranking up the percentage doesn't seem to help, as it just starts to push some off-notes to the front.\n\nThe only other explicit swedish fish flavor I've tried is TPA's Swedish Gummy, and this seems to be a pretty big step up.  This is noticeably less harsh and floral than the TPA Version, and the mouthfeel is quite a bit more like actual swedish fish.  I feel like TPA's version does the deeper part of the flavor a bit better, but 27 fishes is a whole lot more palatable.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  While this definitely tastes \"red\" it probably has a bit too much of a cherry or red licorice vibe to really hit swedish fish outright, but it's fairly close. The cherryish part of this gets a bit plasticy and chemical at higher percentages.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Light to moderate.  Not as punchy as TPA Swedish Gummy.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  I'm not getting too much out of this at 2%.  Some light gummyish mouthfeel but not a lot of actual flavor.  Pretty mellow down here, although the mouthfeel might be useful.\n\nAt 5% this is quite a bit more full.  I'm getting a relatively clear candy flavor out of this but it feels a little bit muted and in the background.  There's some cherry off-notes creeping in around the edges but it isn't particulary harsh or plastic.  Mouthfeel is pretty solid.\n\nTrying this a bit higher at 8% on a day steep, the flavor still feels a bit flat, but it is fuller.  I'm getting more aggressive chemical off-notes but it's not awful for a bright candy flavor. Mouthfeel is legitimately sticky and full.\n\nJust based on these tests, I'd probably start around 3% as an accent flavor, primarily for mouthfeel.  I'd probably use this as a primary flavor around 6-7%.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Passable as single flavor red swedish fish flavor solo, probably with a bit of sweetener to try to fill out that flavor a bit.  I threw a drop of FA Blackcurrant in my remaining 5% sample, and even as a shake and vape its seeming to fill this out a bit more, so that's promising.\n\nAt lower percentages, this is probably going to be a pretty decent candy texturizer.  Flavor is pretty weak down there, but I'm still getting some solid texture without much that tastes chemical or weird.  If that little bit of red isn't going to clash with your profile, this will probably end up working a lot better than FW Gummy Candy or CAP Jelly Candy as a texturizer.  I'll be doing 27 Bears tomorrow, so I'll have a better grasp on how it compares.\n\nTPA Red Licorice is already pretty thick, but this could make it even thicker and chewier.  Should also work really well with some added strawberry or non-floral raspberry.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  Still fairly new.\n\n[Shoutout to ceedee99uk for linking reviews from PeegoreVapes in another thread.](https://peegorevapes.wordpress.com/2017/10/04/capella-silver-line-affordable-flavours/)\n\n[There's a review up from \"S.R.B.\" on the Nicotine River website](https://www.nicotineriver.com/products/capella-silver-line-27-fish): \"I can not recall ever having eaten Swedish Fish, so I can not accurately say if it's on point with how actual candy tastes.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Capella Silverline Acai, 4% and 8%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 10 days.\n**Flavor Description:**  Slightly mysterious mystery berry candy flavor.\n\nTastes like a red candy flavor with some tarter blackberry or cranberry accents.   That candy red flavor kind of dominates the body of the flavor, at least at higher percentages.  Feels very much in the FA blackcurrant family of red candy flavors. Could very well be some super candied raspberry type flavor, but I can’t untaste swedish fish now.   The top notes of the flavor are a bit more lively with some tartness and just a bare hint of astringency.  Reminds me a lot of TPA Cranberry up top, a bit brighter and thinner.  Doesn’t seem floral so much as just a bit bitter and medicinal.  Definitely not full on cough syrup, but more along the lines of something like CAP Harvest Berry.  I think I’m also getting a slightly darker berry somewhere in the mix, right between that sweet red candy body and tart cranberry top notes.  Seems somewhere on the boysenberry-blackberry axis.  \n\nAs far as realistic acai, I don’t think this really hits the profile?  My experience with actual acai is just in weird juice blends, so I’m definitely not an expert.  While it has some of the tartness of the applications of acai I’ve tasted, it doesn’t seem to have the dark cocoa edge of actual acai berries.  The only other acai concentrate I’ve actually tried is FLV, and that definitely has a cocoa component to it.  \n\nOverall mouthfeel is moderately dense.  That candied red flavor is fairly full and sweet, and sort of has a gummy candy vibe to it.  Doesn’t seem particularly juicy, and those astringent and medicinal top notes seem to be drying this out a bit for me.  Sweetness level is fairly high, although those more tart top notes kind of temper that a bit and keep it from going fully cloying.\n\n**Off-Flavors:**  No acai cocoa notes. Slightly medicinal.  Candied “red” body.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Moderate.  Feels just a bit throaty to me, but not outside of the realm of berry flavors in general.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 4%, this seems to be working fairly well.  Seems a bit airy and unsaturated but I’m mostly getting a bright berry flavor.  Sweet and just a bit bitter up top, decent balance overall.  Feels fairly cohesive.\n\nAt 8%,  this has filled in quite a bit, but I’m getting more seperation between the berry components.  “red” body feels more strongly candied, top seems a bit more astringent and tart.  Bitterness picking up and tastes a bit medicinal. \n\nJust based on these tests, I’d probably be using this around 3% as an accent, and around 6-7% for a primary flavor.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Good fit for that generic “acai” kind of flavor in beverage mixes.  Basically adding some tartness and astringency to a juicier fruit base.  Should pair well with juicier apples or pears for that juice blend kind of vibe.  I’d kind of use this like a darker, sweeter cranberry flavor for contrast on super sweet bases. \n\nSomething vaguely energy drink-esque to the base of this flavor.  Maybe add it to some FW Red Bowl or HS Red Energy.\n\nCould be used to give some tartness to a berry bakery, at least at low percentages.  I’d stay away from anything floral, but would to brighten up a concentrate like FW Blackberry.\n\nApparently CAP suggests smoothie flavors? Why not. \n\n**Second Opinions:**  Still fairly new, not a lot of info out there.\n\n[Here is the product page from Capella.

Don't use this at 1%.\n\nAt 4%, a sweet, slightly muted anise flavor. Sweet, moderately dense inhale.  Flat, oxidized lime juice flavor builds towards the end of the inhale. Exhale has flat slightly bitter black licorice top notes.  The anise here is light, almost like the anise flavor you'd get from steeping star anise pods in a cider or sauce. I'd say it's fairly realistic in that way. That flat citrus flavor is pretty prominent. Sweetness is a bit much.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  That citrus note and sweetness are probably not what you're looking for in an anise.\n\n**Throat Hit:** 2/10. Mild for anise.\n\n**Uses:** Anise to punch up fruit mixes, somewhere between 3-5%.  The anise itself isn't sharp enough for candy licorice notes, and the weird lime flavor isn't going to work all that well with creams or bakeries.\n  \n**Pairings:** Apples, Melons, berries, mints. \n\n**Notes:**  Really subdued for an Anise or herb/spice flavor.  I was using this expecting a strong bite, and then wondering why it wasn't showing up in my mixes. Testing as a shake and vape, 4% really does seem to be where this flavor comes out.  Pretty solid up to 8%.  Flavor stays in the background and the sweetness takes over.\n\nExtremely limited utility for this.

User Quakas has great notes, which are in portugese.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/7713)  Here's the google translate version:\n\n\"Flavor sweet sweet anise to pull more to the sweetened aniseed than to the taste of the plant / root, brighter than the FA anise, transparent, weak intensity, 8% strong, 6% secondary flavor, 4 just to flavor. Tendency to lose character with long steepings, combines well with fruits or vanilla, however little intense, it is necessary to use above 6% to notice in the recipe. Pleasant and non-chemical but begins to weigh the recipe if used above 8% leaves little room for other more complex aromas or recipes.\"\n\n[/u/HocusKrokus comments on an Anise thread that CAP Anise is nice but really sweet.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/4f04je/best_anise/)\n\n[ECX reviews, 2 or 3 mention this for undertones.](http://www.ecigexpress.com/diy-e-liquid/diy-e-liquid-flavors/capella-flavor-drops/anise-capella-flavor-drops.html#review-list)\n\nCorroborating evidence that this a good but weaker, accent flavor.\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Capella Silverline Apple Snacks, 4% and 8%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 10 days.\n**Flavor Description:**  Capella calls this “Your favorite apple cinnamon cereal in a cold bowl of milk, you can taste every detail, from the tiny red specks to the crunchy grainy texture of the loops.” So I’m guessing a solo apple jacks profile, and it gets most of the way there.\n\nThis definitely leads with the cereal.  Seems fairly similar to CAP Cereal 27, but maybe a bit farther towards corn pops with less of that corn flakes crispness.  Feels a bit fluffier without feeling soft or soggy. Nothing that feels too overly toasted, and nothing like the corn chips hit of overwhelming acetyl pyrazine.\n\nThe apple here is a bit trickier.  It’s definitely on the subtle side, but that’s probably a fit for an apple cereal.  It feels a bit soft though, and maybe a bit too natural.  It tastes a lot like CAP went with something more similar to their fuji apple instead of a more artificial and fuller apple like their double apple.  The apple doesn’t quite sink in the cereal for me, tasting more like cereal with apple as opposed to an apple cereal. \n\nThe product photo for this has some cinnamon in there, but I’m not picking up any really strong cinnamon component.  If it’s there, it’s there like it is in apple jacks, and is overall pretty subtle.  I get maybe a bit on cinnamon hiding in that more prominent cereal note.  Doesn’t have that slightly sour, metallic cinnamon note that I get in most of the Capella cinnamon concentrates. \n\nAccording the product description, this is supposed to have a milky component to it.  I pick up the milk mostly on the tail end of the exhale.  Nothing sour or butryic but fairly light overall. Same sort of mild creamy aftertaste as cap sweet cream or fa fresh cream. \n\nSo, a lot of components executed fairly well. Overall, texture is moderately full.  The corn pops type base brings most of the texture but it balances a cereal and a creamier component fairly well.  Sweetness level overall seems appropriate for the profile, and doesn’t come across as cloying or undersweet.\n\n**Off-Flavors:**  Nothing chemical or unpleasant.  Apple feels a bit soft.  More corn pops than loop based apple jacks.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light.  Nothing major, but gets a bit dry.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 4%, this just feels dry and light.  I’m tasting my base through the flavor here.  Apple is pretty nonexistent and I’m not getting much texture from the cereal.  No real milky nuance.\n\nAt 8%,  this is getting quite a bit better.  Cereal texture is coming in, the apple is still subtle but it’s there. Some light milk notes on the exhale.\n\nJust based on these tests, I’d go high with this.  I’d probably start around 10% and use this as a primary flavor or solo flavor with some bolstering.  There is a lot going on here, and it really isn’t going to translate well in an accent role.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This seems a lot more like a solo flavor than anything else.  Relatively complete as is, but it could probably use a bit more apple to sell the profile.  I’d pick something gloriously artificial like a red apple and keep it fairly low.  Additionally, this could use a boost of cinnamon from your favorite bakery cinnamon if you’re into it that kind of thing.  If you want a milkier cereal, some additional cream would probably help.  If you’re into forbidden fruit maybe some FA Milk. \n\nOutside of just trying to fill out the apple cereal, there isn’t anything here that wouldn’t let you use this in whatever degenerate application of cereal you want.  So like a donut or something.\n\nA little more hard to recommend for a non apple cereal profile.  If you just want the cereal note, CAP Cereal 27 is a thing that exists.  The apple, cinnamon, and milk also don’t really punch hard enough to really show up in a busier mix.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  Still not a ton out there.\n\n[One review on the BCF product page.

It tastes just a bit artificial but not wildly oversatured like a candy flavor.  It reminds more of something like a fruit leather, where the flavor is a bit concentrated over the actual fruit.  It doesn't have the yellow peach kind of base like TPA or FLV.\n\nThis is a softer flavor.  There isn't anything really bright or overwhelming to it, kind of like an actual apricot.  It's soft, fruity and sweet.  I'm not getting anything dry or spicy here like FA's apricot.  No real hit of vanilla or anything else odd for a fruit here.  No dry peel spice.\n\nStickier mouthfeel to this.  Down low it's pretty much just some of that almost gelatinous lip stickiness, but as the percentage increases it gets a bit more unctous and slightly jammy.  It also seems to get a bit warmer at higher concentrations, does a fairly good job of selling in that jamminess while maintaining a bit of juiciness.  Probably a bit sweet overall for a realistic fruit flavor but it isn't candy sweet.  I'd point to the whole fruit leather thing again.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Not really, It's a bit thin and dry too low and a bit floral too high, but nothing really stands out in the usable range.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Light.  Can get a bit dry before the flavor really get's saturated but pretty mellow overall.  No sign of that whole peach/stone fruit linalool thing.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  Seems a bit weak, even for a CAP fruit.  At 4% I'm getting some sweet apricot flavor, but it feels kind of thin and hollow, without much flavor in the base.  Also feels a bit dry.  Mouthfeel is a little bit sticky but not really warm and jammy.\n\nThis flavor fills in quite a bit at 8%.  That dryness from the base tapers off quite a bit, and there is something that feels a bit warm and juicy bordering on jammy.  That sticky mouthfeel also feels a bit fuller and almost comes across as a gummy type flavor.  Still tastes recognizably like an apricot, although with the heavier saturation it starts to go fruit leather.  Light floral notes, but nothing really overwhelming.\n\nI did test this up higher as a S&V, and it does seem to get a bit floral at 10% and above.  I'd probably be around 7% with this.  Like actual apricot, it's a bit of a softer flavor, so mixing this with brighter fruit is going to move this into the background.  Since it's thinner at low percentages, I don't think this one will work all that well as an accent at a lower percentage, which fits with most of the capella fruits.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Doesn't really have the presence to stand up in bakeries, but this actually seems like a pretty good apricot to use with creams for a sweet, fruity kind of base.  Nothing really green or aggressively spicy to clash with the cream.\n\nMellow enough to fit in with just about fruit you want to throw in.  Brighter fruits are going to take center stage, but would end up being a soft, sweet kind of background for a lot of fruit mixes.  Go bright with strawberry or kiwi, dark with blueberry or fig, or even tropical fruits.  Good sweetener for darker peach mixes, should pair really well plum.\n\nProbably a bit too mellow and still juicy enough that it's not really work as a pairing with tobaccos.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Also kosher to pick over FOTW threads, right?](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/63dcxe/dont_get_caught_without_this_flavor_of_the_week/)  Only one note on CAP Apricot by \"CranberryMarcus\": \"CAP version of the FOTW is a fresh and light one, little bit of the pulp, little bit of the kernel, with a feeling of an underripe apricot, including the skin part.\"  They are using it at 3.8%, so maybe that's part of the difference in takes, or I'm just wildly off-base.\n\n[Here's the ELR Page.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/4880)  User \"acoda\" writes: \"I've really been enjoying this as a single mix.

Tastes of a perfectly baked cookie flavor with some light sugar sprinkled on top. It's not as dry or flakey as FA Cookie but it does have some elements of a flakey flavor.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** CAP Blackberry @ %3 steeped 31 days, @ 6% steeped 7 days. 60/40 VG/PG.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  If I had to guess blind, this tastes like a blackberry, grape, and coconut marshmallow flavor at 3%. At 6%, it gets closer to an actual blackberry, but with a hint of spearmint that gets weird and medicinal.\n\nAt 3%, Inhale is sharper floral blackberry.  Not really dense, but pretty warm overall.  The sharper florals mask a lot of the sweetness on the inhale. The exhale starts with blackberry top notes and a syrupy flat grape sweetness. Coconut really comes out on the back half, working way up from underneath that grape.  Overall I get a lot of fluffy texture, and the coconut is taking that into marshmallow territory.  The florals here linger a bit and turn bitter. That coconut thing also sticks around for a while.  At 6%, The coconut and all that kind of fills out to a spearmint backnote but the entire thing seems a bit unsaturated with actual blackberry.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Down low, I get a waxy coconut sweetness, loud and clear. Almost a a less intense TPA Coconut Candy.  And there is that super fluffy texture.  Up higher, a kind of spearmint cooling vibe.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Light. It's definitely there on the exhale, but nothing too remarkable.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Eh, it's probably a decent enough blackberry, especially for custards and bakeries where there is some serious body to carry the profile.  [/u/SadPandaVapes/ used this some FW Blueberry backup, which is pretty smart.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/5dnpc6/blackberry_custard_pie/)  If you wanted a more realistic blackberry, a small percentage of FA Bilberry would probably help.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nCouple notes on ELR about this being pretty concentrated, but I have to say I just don't see it. S&V Concentration testing, at .25%, this is really light. Good hint of blackberry flavor, but it's just barely there and incredibly thin. At .5%, largely the same but has a bit more a flat candy kind of vibe.  It's a good flavor, but it's way too subtle.  1% doesn't seem a lot stronger than .5%, but I'm getting just a hint of that coconut. 2% is still light for me.  3% is starting to really flesh out. The blackberry is more pronounced, but so is the coconut and it's getting that distracting fluffiness. 4% actually rounds those floral notes out fairly well, but I'm getting more of a slightly cooling kind of spearmint off flavor, on top everything else going on here.  At 5% I'm getting a clearer blackberry and that coconut is kept in check by the spearmint thing. 6% and 7% is a bit medicinal for me.  I'd actually suggest this as a primary note, up between 4-6%.  Lower concentrations have a lot of weird off flavors that I wouldn't want to mess with.\n\nSeems to really need a heavy hand with flavoring, at least for my tastes. If you're having issues with this go bold. It's still not a fantastic blackberry,  it just doesn't seem to saturate the vape... but it's a lot closer at 5% then 3%.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[ELR notes are, as usual, all over the place.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** SilverLine Blackcurrant, 2 and 5%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 3 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Candy blackcurrant, similar to FA Blackcurrant but a bit more tart, much less concentrated, and without that interesting mouthfeel.\n\nThe blackcurrant here is really familiar from FA Blackcurrant.  It's a deeply sweet, dark berry candy flavor without tasting like a generic \"mixed berry.\"  There's a really light kind of floral sharpness at the percentages where this tastes saturated, but it's not overbearing.  Has that similar blackberry mixed with swedish fish thing going that FA has, but this tastes a little bit less like a gummy candy and has a pretty pleasant tartness that kind of cuts through some of that sugary sweetness.\n\nModerately full base but the top notes feel a little dry and thin.  There's some warmth here, but I'd probably call less warm than the FA Blackcurrant.  The primary difference seems to be actual texture of the the vape. Where FA is thick, kind of juicy, and very much a gummy candy mouthfeel, this is a bit less saturated, and quite a bit less full and round.  I'm admittedly a pretty big fan of FA Blackcurrant, but this doesn't seem to nearly as much of that thick, dense mouthfeel.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Still haven't had a real blackcurrant, but I'm pretty convinced I'm not missing much. Very much a ribena type candy blackcurrant.  Nothing tastes off or unpleasant though.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light to moderate.  Not terrible for a fruit, but I'm getting some harshness from the drier top notes.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  I'm not getting much of anything out of this at 2%.  That's usually low for capella, but there isn't much flavor here that low.  Lighter, dry blackcurrant sweetness without a real solid base.  Pretty subtle overall.  A bit tarter than at higher percentages, but the thinness overall is a drag.\n\nAt 5% this is fuller, but still feels a bit light for a normal capella fruit.  There's some still thin dryness hovering around that more solid base.  Not completely out of line with capella fruits, but seems to be a weaker flavor overall.\n\nNot steeped, at 8% I'm starting to push into something I'd consider full flavored.  The top notes are starting to fill in a bit although this is still a bit dry overall.  Also becoming pretty aggressively sweet, but that's balanced somewhat by the tartness.\n\nJust based on these tests, I'd probably mix with this around 4% as an accent and up to about 8% as a primary note.  This just doesn't have much punch down low and seems to require a pretty heavy hand.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**If you're in the market for a substantially weaker and less fun version of FA Blackcurrant, knock yourself out.  Sounds flippant, but FA Blackcurrant is a fairly aggressive flavor, and this should be a lot more mellow in a mix letting some other stuff shine through.  I've seen blackcurrant in lemonade and other beverage type mixes and this may work a bit better if you want to avoid turning the mix into something warmer and stickier.\n\nI'd probably stick with FA Blackcurrant for most of my candy-type mixes, but this might do a better job of preserving textures in bakeries.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  Still fairly new.\n\n[User \"Spacolie16\" ATF has a recipe up using this flavor.](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/66385#currantly_black_by_spacolie16)  Their recipes note include: \"CAP Silverline Black Currant - There isn't a ton of Black Currants on the market, so I was curious about this one in particular. It had a artificial smell and taste as a standalone, so I thought this could be used in a candy recipe. And it does. At 3%, it's rather flavorful, and I think was a perfect amount used for a simple recipe like this.\"  Maybe my taste buds are just a bit fried, but I wouldn't call this particularly saturated even at 5%.\n\n[Here's the product page from Capella.](http://www.capellaflavors.com/products/black-currant.html)  Their description: \"This European favorite has a sweet earthy taste unlike other berries. Fresh gooseberry and passion-fruit-raspberry, mix with the floral aromatic notes of carnations and roses.

It's a true commercial blue raspberry flavor, in that it just tastes \"blue.\"  No real discernible ties to actual fruit.  Again, this is cotton candy so I guess that's okay?\n\nInahle is just slightly bitter sweetness. Dense but not smooth.  Bitterness opens up on the exhale and starts to resemble spun sugar. Blue flavor on the beginning of the exhale with a lingering aspartame and almost creamy vanilla on the tail end.  Sticky sweet, dense, and dry.\n\n**Off-flavors:** I get a bitter aspartame edge to all that sweetness. \n\n**Throat Hit:** 7/10.  This is pretty rough solo.  Kind of like actual cotton candy, it's both super sweet and dense without being wet.  Both of those do weird things to my throat.\n\n**Uses:**  I'd use this an assisted primary note, or as a sweetener in a blue rapsberry juice.

Shoutout to /u/barkenator/ for dropping that [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/3xuh0r/cap_blue_raspberry_cotton_candy_question/)  Strong relatively artificial dark berries (FW Razzleberry, FLV Boysenberry, FW Blueberry). Vanilla or Meringue to make the spun sugar notes more pleasant.\n\n**Notes:**  This is surprisingly realistic, I'm just not 100% sure thats a good thing in this case.  This also requires a pretty decent steep.  I think this is damn near unvapable for at least a week if not two.\n\nS&V testing is challenging here.  I get a noticeable flavor all the way down at 1%.  If you're using this a sweetener I'd stick to under 2% or that sugar note is going to be popping up in weird places all over your juice.  As a primary, this works all the way to at least 8%. Plenty of people recommend this up higher, but that sweetness is almost too much for me at 8%, and anything higher just doesn't rub me the right way.  The harshness doesn't seem to be as linear as that sugar note, but this is pretty rough at anything above 3%.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[OP finds it really rough.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:**  CAP SilverLine Blueberry Extra, 2 and 5%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 4 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Great Blueberry, not nearly enough \"Extra.\" A spooky realistic fresh blueberry, with some issues involving concentration and vibrancy.\n\nThe actual blueberry flavor in here is really impressive.  It's a tarter, fresh blueberry. No jam, no candy, not a baked blueberry, just a ripe, tart, and fresh blueberry.  I complain a lot about capella fruits being artificial tasting, dry, or flat... but this is actually pretty great.  There's a pretty accurate balance of warmer, juicy sweeteness, bright almost tannic tartness, and just a tiny hit of that slightly soapy floral note from actual blueberries.  The overall impression is surprisingly realistic, at least in terms of flavor.  This is by far the closest thing I've had to vaping an actual blueberry.\n\nI've got two issues with this relating to strength.  The first is that it seems to be a relatively unconcentrated flavor.  The usage percentage seems to be largely in-line with the TFA Blueberries, where 10% in a mix isn't out of the question.  The second is that flavor itself is fairly soft, even at those higher percentages.  This is a softer, not particularly saturated type of flavor when it's all in balance.  Just upping the percentage doesn't seem to work as it's blowing out the bottom end and ruining the balance.  As much as I would love using this a single flavor realistic blueberry, I just don't feel like it has enough presence to really pull it off.\n\nI haven't tried all of the blueberries by any stretch of the imagination, but of those that I've tried I'd say this most closely resembles TPA Wild Blueberry.  Comparing them side by side, it really accentuates just how candied blueberry wild actually is.  The SL Blueberry Extra is markedly more tart and realistic.  The SilverLine version does a lot of what adding a small percentage of FA Bilberry can do for blueberry flavors, but with a whole lot better balance than I've ever got.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  None.  It's a pretty damn near perfect fresh blueberry that happens to be way too meek.  That might actually be a fit for the profile, but it's going to be difficult to mix with.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Not really.  It's probably a bit too soft and smooth.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  Therein lies the rub, at least for me.\n\n2% is normally low for a capella fruit, but consistency and all that.  I'm not getting much out of this at 2%.  There's a little bit of blueberry tartness in there, but I mostly taste raw VG.  It's basically blueberry scented VG at 2%.\n\n5% is a bit better.  The tartness has filled out, there's some realistic blueberry sweetness showing up with a little bit of warmth, and just the slightest bit of a realistic blueberry floral.  It's actually fairly well balanced at 5%, it just tastes like it's sitting in the background of a single flavor test, which is odd.\n\nIncreasing the percentage on this is giving me fairly mixed results.  The heavier blueberry sweetness in here does move a little further toward being bright and vibrant, but it's swamping the tarter nuance and getting a weirder blueberry candy and really light ammonia thing.  Probably needs a longer steep, but 8% seems to be my sweet spot with this.  It adds a little bit more body without destroying all that nuance. This gets a bit flat and weird by 10% and 12% is even more candy heavy.\n\nJust based on these tests, I don't think this really can pull off being a primary note in a busy mix, but if you were going to use it as a softer blueberry flavor I'd probably mix between 6-8%.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  The first thing I'd want to do with this would be figure out a way to make it actually work as a primary flavor.  I have a mix steeping right now with 8% and .5% FLV Sweetness to see if some sweetener can drag that flavor up to the front without destroying the balance here.  If you're into blueberries, and want a solo mix, this is a great flavor for a full, fresh blueberry in here, but you'll have to figure out a way to get it out.\n\nAs a fan of casual blasphemy, I'd say that you might be able to mess around with EdibleMalfunction's Holy Trinity of blueberries.  This may be able to stand in for the TPA Blueberry Extra, FA Bilberry part of the stool, covering some of the tartness and more authentic-ish blueberry flavor.  That FW Blueberry is still going to be required to actually make this punch a little harder.\n\nIf you just want some blueberry in the background, should mix well with damn near any fruit.  Should also work as a light but realistic blueberry in a mix with lighter creams.  Something richer like an ice cream or custard would probably stomp all over this.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  Still fairly new.  I can't find much.\n\n[Shoutout to ceedee99uk for linking reviews from PeegoreVapes in another thread.](https://peegorevapes.wordpress.com/2017/10/04/capella-silver-line-affordable-flavours/)\n\n[Here's the product page from Capella.](http://www.capellaflavors.com/products/blueberry-extra.html)  Their description: \"More Blueberry.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Capella Bold Burley Tobacco, 4% and 8%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 42 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** A sweet base, and darker, slightly herbal tobacco leaf finish.\n\nSo pretty common refrain after trying their [Original Blend](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/7ylse9/capella_original_blend_tobacco/) and [Smokey Tobaccos](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/7z4tov/capella_smokey_tobacco/), but this has that same heavily sweet, fluffy base to it.  Feels a bit like someone overdid FA Oba Oba with a tobacco base. Sweetness again is pretty front-loaded, with the tobacco coming through on the backend.\n\nI don't know if I would call it \"bold\" behind all that sweetness, but it does have more of a leafy tobacco flavor in here.  Darker tobacco, but it feels pretty subtle next to that big sweet base.   Light leathery note with a kind of numbing light licorice root finish.  The sweetness and the leaf flavor definitely pushes in a herbal direction, almost a really mellow sassafras vibe.    Kind of neutral tobacco flavor without any prominent grassy or nutty notes.  Nothing too dirty, ashy, or smokey in here.  Not as sour as the other Capella tobaccos.\n\n**Off-Flavors:**  Pretty heavily sweetened and fluffy for a tobacco.  Nothing unpleasant or chemical here.  Light numbing, anesthetic effect.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light, nothing major.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 4%, this leads with a heavy sweetness.  Tobacco on the back end is dark and non-descript.  Lighter herbal note but nothing dirty or overwhelming.\n\nAt 8%, a bit sweeter and definitely fluffier in texture. Tobacco picks up a more distinct leathery note, and that light herbal note has been fleshed out a bit more. Leather starts to come out, and that finish has picked up a bit of licorice.  Lightly numbing.\n\nJust based on these tests, I'd again be up to 10%+ with this as a solo flavor.  I'd go 6% as a primary flavor or 3% as an accent.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Probably the closest of the Capella tobacco flavors to a satisfying solo tobacco vape. Still pretty heavily sweet, but the tobacco here works pretty well.\n\nWith the heavy sweetness, seems like more of a sweetener and texturizer for darker pipe tobacco flavors.  Lacking the sourness of the other Capella tobaccos, I'd throw heavier, moist, and funkier pipe tobaccos at this one.  This should lift them and dry them out while adding a solid sweetness.\n\n**Second Opinions:** Nah, not seeing anything out there.\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** CAP Butter Cream@ 4%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 24 days.\n\nBefore we begin here, /u/mlNikon/ and I posted reviews within 15 minutes of each other.  You should check that out [**here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/5fyj8h/cap_butter_cream/), especially because they get a clear butter flavor out of this.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  A subtle, undersweet, buttercream frosting flavor.  When I've made actual buttercream frosting I've always been suprised by how waxy and fatty-tasting it actually is.  Then I double the sugar and just go to fat-kid heaven.  This captures the feeling of an undersweetened homemade buttercream almost perfectly.\n\nDense inhale. No real discernible flavor, just a heavy richness. Exhale is more of the same. Light sweetness, dense creamy flavor without pronounced dairy notes.  I don't taste a ton going on here.  I'd classify this more as a mouthfeel additive as opposed to a flavor.  It gives the impression of buttery richness without cheesy dairy notes.  It also doesn't give me that stale cardboard taste that you can get with dense flavors that don't have a lot going on.  Finish is relatively clean, with just a lingering thick waxy mouthfeel.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Finish is a bit waxy, but not playdough / phenolic like CAP glazed donut.  It's a rich waxyness you'd get from an actual butter-cream.\n\n**Throat Hit:** 0/10\n\n**Uses:**  Dense, rich, thick mouthfeel for creams and cream mixes.\n\n**Pairings:**  This flavor is nuetral enough that your pairings should be wide open.  I added some buttercream to CAP cranberry and CAP grapefruit testers and it seems to work well with sharper fruits, so I'm going to officially say \"damn near anything\" including creams, all your fruits, bakeries, nuts, maybe even some tobaccos.  I'd stay away from anything too astringent or heavy menthol.\n\n**Notes:**  You should probably just check the second opinions down at the bottom here.  I get all mouthfeel and very subtle dairy notes.  In terms of percentages, 1-2% is the definite consensus.  I get a really noticeable change in mouthfeel as low as 1%.  I'd stay away from using this as a primary flavor.  The waxyness gets a bit much even at 4%.  If everyone else is right, and I am crazy, then the butter/dairy notes will be too pronounced at higher percentages.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nI picked this up (and I'm guessing I'm not alone here) when that Apple Buttah recipe from /u/goldfish18/ dropped.  [His description is basically straight up butter with a slight sweetness.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/4zqehv/apple_buttah_from_the_inaugural_diyordie_mixers/)\n\n[/u/thecleanvape calls it straight butter.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/3h8fnp/new_cream_capella_flavors/)\n\n[/u/RuntDastardly/ uses it a stroopwafel recipe for richness and the unctuous quality it brings to the table](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/4e7snt/dutchie_a_delicious_stroopwafel/)\n\n[ELR users pick up a strong butter taste](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/48949)\n\nSo, basically everyone else tastes heavy butter here.  I don't really.  I do get the impression of butter without the heavy dairy notes.  I'm willing to assume that my taste buds are weird, but YMMV.\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

I'm missing a lot of a toasted or even really cooked edge to those pecans.  Doesn't have a real AP Crunch to it.\n\nThere's a lighter butter note in here. Doesn't quite seem rich enough for a butter pecan, but it's a nice accent to everything else going on.  The caramel here is on the light side, and not particularly caramelized.  It has a fairly pleasant stickiness to it, but it's missing some vibrancy.  I also get some brighter vanilla, especially at higher percentage.  Almost picks up a meringue kind of edge with that slightly sticky dry sweetness and lighter caramelization.  Also seems to have a bit of cocoa on the backend.\n\nTexture here is a bit on the dry side when the flavor is fairly saturated.  At lower percentages the exhale is a bit thin and watery. I do get some of that caramel stickiness but it doesn't really have a thick or rich mouthfeel.\n\nThe only butter pecan flavor I have for comparison is FW Butter Pecan, and it's a pretty strong argument that the SilverLine version is fairly inessential.  The FW version feels noticeably richer, deeper, and nuttier than the SilverLine.  The FW is a darker flavor overall, definitely tastes a little more caramelized.  The Silverline version maybe has a bit more vanilla to it, but is lacking in butter compared to the FW.  And the FW is a bit more concentrated.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Pecan here tastes raw and picks up a bit of green at higher percentages.  Subtle cocoa in mid-ranges.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light.  There's a dryness here that gets a bit rough.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 2% I'm getting a decent butter pecan flavor on the inhale with a medium caramel and just a bit of richness.  Completely dies off on the exhale though. Kind of watery and lightly sour without any real heavy nuttiness.  Maybe a bit of a raw pecan kind of taste, but it's pretty bland overall.\n\nAt 5%, definitely more so than the 2 or 8%, I pick up some cocoa on the backend of it.  Not sure why it's only really showing up in the middle of the range, but it's fairly comparable to the cocoa on the tail of a dulce de leche kind of flavor.  Medium caramel here, but not a lot of buttery richness.  Exhale has filled in a bit and lost that watery lightly sour thing, but I'm still not getting a solid nuttiness here.\n\nAt 8% i do get more pecan out of this, but it still tastes a bit on the raw side.  It doesn't have a strong cooked flavor, and it's really low on that nutty AP crunch.  The caramel and butter note here is pretty decent, but I'm just not getting enough pecan to carry it all.  Also picking up a tiny hint of that gasoline green nut note here.\n\nJust based on these tests, I'd probably use this at around 4% as an accent and 6-7% as a primary flavor.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  If you haven't picked this up, just based on these really quick tests, I'd probably just say skip it and pick up FW Butter Pecan.  I'm not sure there are any specific applications that would really benefit from a less nutty butter pecan.\n\nI could see using this if you wanted a softer caramel flavor instead of the darker FW, and for some reason didn't have another caramel lying around.\n\nIn general, you're looking at the usual butter pecan suspects, primarily creams, bakeries, and tobaccos.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  Still fairly new.\n\n[Shoutout to ceedee99uk for linking reviews from PeegoreVapes in another thread.](https://peegorevapes.wordpress.com/2017/10/04/capella-silver-line-affordable-flavours/)\n\n[Here's the product page from Capella.](http://www.capellaflavors.com/products/butter-pecan.html)  Their description: \"You have had the ice cream and the cake, now try Silverline’s secret recipe of rich butter and nutty pecans!

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** CAP Caramel v1 @ %3, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 7 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  It's interesting. I get a mix of medium caramelized sugar, maple, and a buttery type of note kind of similar to CAP Vanilla Whipped Cream.  Overall effect is pretty solid, and it does taste quite a bit like caramel sauce. \n\nInhale is dense, a little sharp, and dry, Caramelized sugar top notes.  Seems like just a tin bit of like a lemony kind of sourness.  It's subtle, and not as sour as some of the other Capella stuff but I feel like it's there.  Exhale has slightly dry carmelized sugar right up front, higher almost maple top notes show up after that. The mouthfeel comes in on the back half of the exhale. Has a little bit of wax to it, with a light buttery whip cream moutfeel. Overall, pretty fluffy.  Dense, but not particulary rich.  Caramelized sugar that doesn't push over to a darker, gritty flavor like FA Caramel or especially FLV Caramel.  A little bit of that subtle sourness lingers with that maple top note.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Light bit of soapyness right on the tail end. Not as pronounced as FA Caramel and you shouldn't pick it up in mixes at a normal percentage.  I get some sourness, but I get that with most of the capella bakeries and creams and I don't really here anyone else complain about that... so I'm figuring it's just me here.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Eh, a little dry. Not really harsh.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  It's caramel, man. So anything really. Less of just a straight dark sweetener like FA Caramel or FLV Caramel.  You could probably pass this off as an actual caramel sauce with the right cream behind it. The slight maple tinge here actually reminds me of TFA Bavarian Cream, so maybe stay away from that if you don't want the mix to read as too maple-y.  If you pick up a sour note, then probably stay away from too thin of a mix.  Might get a bit astringent and soapy.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nS&V concentration testing, .5% is a lighter hint of lightly roasted sugar. I get almost no mouthfeel here. Might be useful-ish down here as a medium-dark sweetener if you don't have FA Caramel.  At 1% I get a really insubstantial kind of caramel whipped cream thing. Like caramel flavored kool-whip. 1.5% is pretty similar, but I'm getting a bit more body to that whip cream taste. Tastes like a watered down version of [DIYFS Mr. Good Stuff](https://redd.it/5kvy7n) with the maple standing in for vanilla.  2% is like a slightly dry commercial caramel sauce. Those whip cream notes are bolstering the overall caramel effect as opposed to standing apart.  2.5% is getting sour for me, but the caramel sauce tastes a bit fuller. Still pretty cohesive. 3% is where this seems to come apart again. The buttery notes are back off in their own corner and the roasted sugar is getting pretty sour.  Still not tasting too dark, though.  3.5% and 4% continues that trend for me. I get more sour lemon dark sugar and some overly-whipped cream. I'd personally mix with this at 1.5-2.0% if you're mixing this with something without a cream note, and start at 3.0% if you are adding some additional cream to smooth out the concentrate.\n\nI actually like this one quite a bit more than FA Caramel as a straight caramel flavor. I think the taste of Caramel isn't especially great, but this seems just dark enough and it doesn't have some of the pronounced mouthfeel problems of FA or the absoloute coil gore of some of the FW or TFA offerings.  It's not like a revelation or anything, but it seems pretty solid to me.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nSurprisingly sparse for a pretty basic capella flavor. [All I could find on the sub was that /u/turkourjurbs/ said it \"tasted like air\" in a older FOTW.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/3nkjw8/flavor_of_the_week_caramel/)\n\n[They don't like it much on the 'ol Vaping Underground.](http://vapingunderground.com/threads/recommend-caramel-percentages.129559/)\n\n[Good reviews on BCF.](http://www.bullcityflavors.com/caramel-cap/) [Mostly positive on ECX, some disagreement between whether this is super strong or way too weak.

More of the same on the exhale. Sweetness is pretty subdued. Melon flavor square in the middle of the exhale. Flat, thick flavor with some perfume notes that don't quite cohere into a full cantaloupe flavor.  Other reviews have mentioned creaminess, and I don't quite agree.  It's definitely thick, but I'm not getting a smoothness I'd call creamy.  No dairy notes there.  I'm getting a flatter melon candy flavor under those perfume notes, not a realistic cantelope.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Perfumey, especially on the inhale and lingering notes on the exhale.\n\n**Throat Hit:** 5/10.  This is pretty rough initially.  Seems to smooth out a bit with extended use, but that initial note is pretty offputting.\n\n**Uses:**  Density would lend itself to mixes with brighter fruits.  Something like a brighter watermelon flavor, where this would thicken the mix up.  Mixes well with creams and vanillas.  Perfume is tamed a a bit with creams.\n  \n**Pairings:** Mints, other melons, strawberry.  I'd stay away from floral fruits like peaches and pears. VBIC seems to work really well. FLV Cream or FA Fresh Cream.  \n\n**Notes:**  This confuses me a bit. I had to warm up to this flavor.  It starts out almost soapy and perfumey and kind of settles into a pretty dull middle of the road melon flavor. Putting it down and walking away for a while it always seems rough on the first couple hits.  Those perfume notes are a bit hard to manage.  A subtle melon note and sharp perfume notes are going to make this hard to manage as a primary flavor in a mix.  I'd stick to 2-4% as a supporting player.\n\nBoth [INW Melon](https://redd.it/4q57vh) and [FLV Cantaloupe](https://redd.it/4nf26x) are really good for this style of melon.

I can also see this working well with certain fruits if you wanted to get creative with pairing the chocolate.\n\n**Notes:**   I didn't include creams in the pairings simply because some of them that I tried had a tendency to take away from the dense cakey chocolate.  There might be some that do work for you, but in my experience they tend to slightly mute the chocolate and seemingly \"thin out\" the mouthfeel.

No yeast or richness, but a fluffy dryness.\n\nInhale is moderately dense, sour bakery cinnamon.  Fluffy but not rich. That cinnamon stays with you on the exhale, losing most of the sour character. Fluffy grainy exhale. I get a thin icing flavor towards the end of the exhale, with a bit of lingering sourness.  I'm saying sour at lot, but it's manageable here.  Some extra cream or butter should take care of most of it.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Slightly sour, especially at lower temperatures.  I think it's the cinnamon here.  I catch the same thing off of CAP Graham Cracker.  Sourness eases up as you increase power.  I get in mostly on the inhale and the very tail end of the exhale.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** CAP SilverLine Cinnamon Sugar, 2 and 5%, others noted, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 8 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  More of a cinnamon and sugar additive for existing bakeries than a full flavor.\n\nThere's a light pastry note in here, but it seems to be taking a back seat to the cinnamon and sugar.  It's almost like a blonde untoasted poptart-esque note. A little powdery without too much texture.\n\nThis feels like more cinnamon than sugar.  The cinnamon here seems pretty similar to the cinnamon in Capella CDS.  It's a bit drier and spicier here, but that's probably just the lack of pastry around it.  I get something metallic out of it, but that's a minority report.  Not picking up too much discrete sugar flavor, but it's definitely doing some sweetening.  There's some dry powdery texture more like a confectioners sugar instead of a heavy granulated sugar but it's relatively subtle.\n\nI do get some tartness or a light sour note out of this.  It may just be that capella cinnamon acting weird for me, but it's somewhere in there.  Not really a lemonish tartness, more like a slightly watery generic tartness or sour.  It's not overwhelming, but it seems to hit over the entire exhale.\n\nThis works a whole lot like [FLV Pastry Zest.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/700t2l/flv_pastry_zest/)  I like the cinnamon note a bit more in the Pastry Zest, but capella bakery cinnamon tends to have a mouthfull-of-pennies type sour metallic thing going on for me.  I also feel like the texture is a bit better on the back end with pastry zest.  The tartness in the SilverLine version is a bit less intense though, so this might be a bit more useful overall.  This is less concentrated than the pastry zest for sure, but pastry zest is one of the $7.49 flavors, so the actual value here could be relatively comparable based on how heavy you want that cinnamon.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Definitely more of an additive. Some tartness here beyond just straight cinnamon and sugar.  Capella's bakery cinnamon is metallic for me, but I seem to be in the minority there... but if you pick it up off other capella flavors it's in here as well.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light, nothing major solo or mixed.\n\n**Percentage testing:**   Solo testing this, at 2% I'm getting some lighter, dry cinnamon.  There's a bit of dry, sugary texture but it isn't too intense.  Light metallic tang that feels just a hair watery.\n\nAt 5% solo, there's quite a bit more cinnamon but I wouldn't call it incredibly spicy.  Still not really overwhelming. Texture seems pretty solidly dry and powdery.  That metallic note is still there but it feels a little more tart without that watery thing at 2%.\n\nUsing this as an addtive at 3% with 3% FA Apple Pie, the cinnamon and sugar thing is translated fairly well.  Seems to bolster the pastry note just a bit, and I get some fairly mild cinnamon.  Not noticing a huge boost in texture.  Extra tartness is noticeable, but it seems to be working okay with the lighter apple in the FA Apple Pie.\n\nUsing this at 6% with 2% INW Biscuit, seems to be doing a bit of a snickerdoodle thing.  Texture is still a bit powdery overall instead of granulated, but it feels like it's relatively effective at giving a cinnamon and sugar dusting.  The tartness shows up a bit for me, but it's not completely overwhelming and seems a little more manageable than FLV Pastry Zest.\n\nJust based on these tests, I'd be using this as a cinnamon-sugar pastry dusting.  This is a bit weaker than you'd expect from a cinnamon.  Usable at 3% as a lighter accent, but seems a little better at doing what it needs to do closer to 5-6%.  Cinnamon is pretty subjective, but this comparatively mellow compared to some of the of the options.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Probably a bit more versatile than FLV Pastry Zest, or just adding a cinnamon bakery like CDS or FW Cinnamon Roll to a pastry mix.  I'd probably stick with FLV Pastry Zest for fruit-forward profiles where the tartness isn't going to be an issue because the texture is a bit better and I prefer the cinnamon there, but this should work fairly well for bakeries without fruit.\n\nI'm thinking an additive for snickerdoodles, ginger snaps, and maybe coffee cakes.  I'm sure the list is longer there.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  Still fairly new.\n\n[Shoutout to ceedee99uk for linking reviews from PeegoreVapes in another thread.](https://peegorevapes.wordpress.com/2017/10/04/capella-silver-line-affordable-flavours/)\n\n[Here's the product page from Capella.](http://www.capellaflavors.com/products/cinnamon-sugar.html)  Their description: \"SilverLine’s Cinnamon Sugar.

Artificial sweetener notes show up halfway through the exhale and linger after the finish. \n\nSort of generic mint flavor with almost no sharp edges.  Creamy non-dairy light vanilla volume to it. Close to, but not quite, a peppermint, but definitely not a spearmint. No realistic mint herb notes or chemical harshness.  Moderately to lightly mentholated.

Creams, thick or light.\n\n**Notes:**  Good mint to use with creams and chocolates if you want to replicate a bland commercial-type mint.  Really smooth, linear strength up to around 10%.  Creamy vanilla notes will blend well in these applications.  The Creme de Menthe's (FLV and FW) are pretty highly regarded with these kind of flavor profiles, so I'd definitely take a look at those first.  \n\nThose sucralose-ish notes mess with top notes on most fruit and seem to make dark fruits a bit weird. I'd keep it to brighter non-perfumey fruits and take it pretty easy there.

Relatively subtle, at least compared to FA Yogurt and FLV Greek Yogurt.  Has some of the chalkyness you'd expect but doesn't cross the line into straight butryic rancid.\n\nReally depends on your temperature. at 400F, chalky inhale.  Exhale has a bit of creaminess. Dairy note is fairly realistic.  A little bit sour as well. Sweetness is really subdued. At 450, still chalky on the inhale, but those diary notes show up as well.  Exhale is cheese forward, then some sourness. Moderately thick mouthfeel, and surprisingly clean on the finish.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Cheese rinds.  Pretty recognizable cheese rinds.  Almost a bit nutty. Seems to show up right around 420F, at least on my setup. \n\n**Throat Hit:** 0/10\n\n**Uses:**  Yogurt bases, more realistic dairy note in creams.\n\n**Pairings:**  Bright fruits.  Jammy fruits. Graham and cereal type of concentrates for texture in the yogurt.  Creams.\n\n**Notes:**  This is the part where I say that I'm not usually a fan of yogurts.  When they run warm, it gets super weird super quickly. I'm willing to call this a pretty good yogurt option for people who don't really like yogurts.  While it doesn't sound like a ringing endorsement, the fact that the flavor here runs towards cheese and not vomit is huge, for me at least.\n\nAt 4%, this is pretty full-flavored without being overwhelming.  S&V testing, this seems pretty recognizable at about 2%.  Taking this up higher is definitely not for me.  I'd use this as a base, probably with other creams. I'd suggest 1-2% to add just a bit of funk to a otherwise creamy base.  If you want to go full yogurt, then 4% seems like the play.\n\nThis really does strike me as a more mellow version of FLV Brie Cheese.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nApparently this doesn't really read as yogurt for people on Vaping underground [here](http://vapingunderground.com/threads/creamy-yogurt-cap-not-even-close-to-yogurt.265306/) and [here.](http://vapingunderground.com/threads/capella-creamy-greek-yogurt.123771/)\n\n[Decent notes on ELR, lot of yoplait being tossed around.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/46336)\n\n[Pretty good % recommendations on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/3nkx9j/cap_creamy_yoghurt/)\n\n[Strawberry Yogurts recipe, Wayne call it's the best yogurt flavoring available.](http://diyordievaping.com/2015/08/18/strawberry-yogurts/)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Some peel builds towards end of inhale and carries through into exhale.  Fruit of the cucumber shows up on exhale on top of the peel.  Sweetness builds through exhale. Exhale ends on a medium sweet note and a lingering taste like cucumber slices in water. Overall, pretty dead on the type of cucumber flavor you get from that cucumber lime gatorade, maybe a touch more realistic with some of the peel notes.

I don't think it's that strong. S&V at .5% and 1% seems too watery for me to go solo.  Accent at 1-2% seems realistic, and this tastes okay up to about 6% solo.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** CAP Fig @ 3%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 8 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** A dark berry flavor. Skews close to prune, with flashes of a more vibrant grape.  Some subtle dark mustiness.  Syrupy as opposed to juicy, with a nice round sweetness.\n\nInhale is dark and sweet. Moderately dense sugary plum.  Exhale has some bright realistic grape top notes over that dark sweet prune base.  Maybe picking up some syrupy raspberry there as well. Full exhale without being too dense.  Sweetness tastes natural if a bit heavy and syrupy. Slight funk in there, more realistic fruit than any kind of dusty flavor.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Nothing weird. A tiny bit bright, but everything fits well.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Moderate. Warm harshness when vaped solo.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  My frame of reference here is pretty narrow. I've had fig newtons, and cooked mission figs.  This steers closer to the fig newton side of things, but the actual figs I've had have been doused in some sort of pork fat so YMMV.\n\nThe prune and grape thing makes me think about using this to add another dimension to grape flavors, as those tend to skew pretty bright and candy-ish. 2% of this should bring back in a deeper, richer natural grape flavor.  Or take it up a bit further and really cook those grapes and end up with something a lot more like grape jelly or jam.  It would also help to darken up your berry mixes without adding that obnoxious generic mixed-berry note.\n\nShould work well with brandy concentrates, brightening those up a bit and reinforcing the fermented grape note there.  Also in wine/champagne concentrates to bring in some deeper red wine notes.\n\nThe dark and syrupy sweetness of the concentrate is a fit for panettone (sexy, sexy italian fruitcake) type of bakeries with dried fruits and roasted nuts.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nS&V concentration testing, this is super linear. 1% is a little light and perfumey. 2% brings in more of that dark sweetness. Starts to border on syrupy at 3%.  4% is starting to get a bit floral and that bright grape is a little obtrusive.  A steep will help considerably here. I'm not enjoying this at 5% and over, as those perfume notes get a bit too intense.  I'd mix with this at 2% to just punch up a grape, and go up to 3 or 4% for some full-on syrupy sweetness.\n\nThis is missing some of the richer date notes I'd expect from a cooked fig, but overall this is pretty great. I don't understand figs well enough to call it accurate or not, but it is damn tasty and seems pretty versatile.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[/u/jonb622 has a recipe using this up at 7.5%.  I'd say that is the source of the perfumey notes, but his notes on the concentrate are pretty good.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/48dxh0/blackberry_fig_tobacco/)\n\n\"The fig - Everything I've read pretty much crowns FA Fig as the best, but I decided to go with what I already had. Capella's Fig is surprisingly delicious, as I'm not a big fan of most of their fruity flavors I've tried. I've never tasted a fresh fig, so I can't compare. But I can say that this flavor is very sweet and pretty bold. Almost has a dark berry kind of taste to it. It's quite floral, but in a good way. At the percentage I used, it is the dominant flavor in the recipe. It's not overbearing (at least to my tastebuds), but the sweet and floral notes are definitely prevalent.\"\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

This tastes like frozen french toast sticks smell while they bake.  Lightly fluffy flat bread, super buttery maple syrup with some vanilla, and slightly sour bakery cinnamon and nutmeg. Pervasive egginess.\n\nSweet, moderately thin inhale with bakery cinnamon and nutmeg notes.  Exhale just blooms into buttery maple with a hint of vanilla.

Just a bit harsh and a little weird on the throat.\n\n**Uses:**  The essence of french toast.  Add some supporting flavors to push the aspects of this you want to the forefront.\n\n**Pairings:**  I'd push the egginess here, by adding some Cap Vanilla Custard v1.  Would go well with buttery creams and bright or jammy fruits.  Whiskey or liquid amber to give it some more warmth.  Joy or CDS for a more full breadiness.  Really, this is discontinued so if you have it just find a solid recipe and enjoy.\n\n**Notes:** Nightmare dark and (i'm guessing) probably half diketones by weight, this has been discontinued.  I wouldn't have mixed the tester if I had done my research beforehand, but I only figured that part out when I got to my second opinion googling.  I was iffy on posting on a review for something discontinued, but I figure there has to be people like me who impulse bought this, and then promptly didn't do anything with it.\n\nS&V testing, I like this up to about 3%. The thinness of the flavor becomes pretty pronounced above that.  There is a lot going on here, but it just doesn't cohere into a dense, thick flavor.  It's more a chorus of thinner flavors stacking on top of each other.  Even at something like 2% this is going to be unmistakable and would bully it's way into being a main note in the profile.\n \nIt's actually kind of a bummer that this got discontinued.  Just from my limited experience I haven't found a concentrate that works like this one. It's a really interesting, although super distinct, concentrate.  Apparently [RF has a french toast flavor](https://www.realflavors.com/products/french-toast) that may work as a sub.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** CAP SilverLine Fruit Circles, 2 and 5%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 11 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  A well balanced dry fruity loops flavor, but a little on the soft side and requiring a fairly high concentration to get a full flavor.\n\nGood balance of the actual fruit here.  I'd still say it's a bit citrus forward but the lemon here doesn't go into full on pledge.  Actually does a pretty good job of capturing that duller, sweeter version of lemon and lime that the cereal leads with.  I do get some more \"red\" type fruity notes in there that balance out the entirely thing nicely.\n\nI also get some of that drier sugary coating on there.  Sweetness level is on point.  The taste of the actual cereal base is pretty spot on as well.  I get a hint of that cereal maltiness here, not overwhelming, but helps the balance.\n\nThere's some actual texture here as well.  Feels just a bit softer, but there is some pretty appropriate cereal grain.  I wouldn't call it actually crispy or dry, but you can feel some of that malty cereal grain.  Definitely a dry cereal flavor, I'm not really picking up anything milky or creamy.\n\nI don't have a huge basis for comparison here.  I'm not usually after cereal and when I am I just embrace the cancer and use FW Fruity Flakes.  FW Fruity Flakes is quite a bit stronger and has a much more present AP type crunchy base to it, but you know, sugar syrup.  Comparing it to TPA Fruit Circles, the SilverLine does have quite a bit less of a lemon nightmare thing going on, so that's cool, although I'd still argue the TPA does a better job with the crunchy part of the cereal.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Besides the general issues with the softness of this flavor, nothing tastes off.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Nah.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 2% I'm getting some softer lemon accents and just a bare amount of cereal grain taste if not texture.  Works okay on the inhale, but the exhale is thinner and soft.\n\nAt 5% this is feeling a bit more fleshed out. The lemon is stronger, but still not pledge-ish, and I'm getting more of that red backend.  Malt taste is a bit more prominent, and just a bare hint of texture in the vape.\n\nI've tried this higher at 8 and 12%, and I think it works a bit better up there. Flavor doesn't really get bold or vivid, but the texture does fill out a bit more.  Still isn't picking up a lemon pledge thing this high.  Still more on the soft side, but the texture is probably workable at higher percentages.\n\nJust given these tests, I'd either use this an accent around 5-6%, or a primary note all the way up at 10% or up.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I'm thinking this doesn't quite have the texture to pull off being the only cereal concentrate in a mix for something dry or crunchy.  I think using a crunchier cereal like CAP Cereal 27 or TPA Crunch Cereal as a base, then adding in a pretty healthy percentage of this flavor should get you most of the way to a dry fruit loops.  Could also work well with the frosted note on a dry fruit loops like FW Fruit Rings, sort of like a meringue which also bumps up the cereal base a bit.\n\nThis should also be a pretty good cereal note by itself for a cereal milk type of vape.  The softness of the texture isn't going to dry out a milker, creamier concentrate.\n\nIf you wanted to get all weird with it, you could also use this as a lighter fruit loops flavor for adding on top of a bakery.  People are still doing that, right?\n\n**Second Opinions:**  Still fairly new.\n\n[Here's the ELR Page.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/204059)  One note of substance up there by \"juice junkie\" who writes: \"Mixed at 6% and let it steep a week.

Closer to a red apple than a tarter green apple. Nothing too sharp or angular, just a fairly realistic apple sweetness. As /u/hoodratt/ noted, sweetness really picks up with more wattage.  Lightly harsh, with a little bit of a sugar lips kind of stickiness. Exhale isn't a whole lot more complicated. Apple flesh. Some lighter grassy notes, but on the sweet, soft side. No real tartness here. Texture is interesting. It has a bit of a grain to it, but overall the softness and some juiciness make it taste a bit mealy. Like a realistic, but still not fantastic, red delicious apple. Sweetness isn't cloying, but it does start to taste a bit flat and artificial at higher percentages. Still not getting a lot of harshness out of this.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Gets a bit grassy once you push 4% and over. Not really weird for an apple. Sweetness also seems just a little flat and artificial.\n \n**Throat Hit:** Light, it's there but not too aggressive. Less harsh than FA Fuji.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This doesn't have quite the strong apple punch that FA or JF Fuji have, and it also lacks a really identifiable peel. I think because of this it's not necessarily the Fuji you want to use if you're either trying to work Fuji with heavy flavors, or if you want a standalone apple vape.\n\nIt's going to make your juice a bit watery if you're mixing with drier bakeries or creams.  It also doesn't really have the apple heft to punch through in those busier, richer mixes like FA Fuji. The lack of a peel note and kind of mealy texture isn't as appealing as the crispness in the JF version for a more realistic take on a realistic apple-forward vape.\n\nI would use this as a backup texture and sweetness component behind other fruits. I could see working to thin out and give some realistic texture to syrupy darker berries, and I think adding this behind something like pineapple or brighter tropical flavors is going to bend the flavor more towards a fruit juice.\n\n**Notes:** Concentration testing, this isn't as strong as the other Fuji concentrates.  I can't taste much at .25, and it's still very weak soft apple at 1%. Just some vague sweetness. 2% is still a bit on weak side for me to taste the actual apple here. Fairly realistic juicy apple flesh, but it doesn't necessarily scream out apple at me.  I think it would be hard to find fruits that wouldn't pair with this at 2%.  3% has a bit more texture.  Still a lighter appple flavor, but I feel like it does a decent job of emulating just the flesh of a fuji-ish apple. 4% is a bit too textured, with that crispness running into the juiciness and tasting more than a bit mealy. It also seems to be going a bit grassy on me and the sweetness is losing some realism and is starting to taste flat and heavy. 5% is unpleasantly grassy and harsh.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nStill fairly new, so not a ton of information out there.\n\n[This got posted up last week, quick take on the flavor by /u/hoodratt/](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/6h0txo/got_my_hands_on_capellas_new_fuji_apple/)\n\n[ELR is pretty useless thus far.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/174893)\n\n[One quick review on BCF by user \"Joshua R.\"  5 stars saying: \"Mixes amazing with watermelon.

Not a gingerbread as in your holiday gingerbread men or ginger snaps.

More than anything, the flavor reminds me of some Japanese ginger snacks I picked up at an Asian market once, similar to [these](http://imgur.com/9JW6P7R).  \n\n\n**Off flavors**: Syrupy.

Followed quickly by stone fruits. Goodness this would go well with peach, I think, like in a peach pie. Also citrus, berries, tropical fruit, brown sugar, creams, custards, teas.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** CAP Golden Butter@ 4%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 26 days for the solo.\n\n**Flavor Description:** This tastes almost identical to CAP Butter Cream to me, with volume turned up a bit from like 2 on the buttercream to a whopping 3 or 3 1/2. Tastes quite a bit like homemade buttercream frosting, especially as this seems noticeably sweeter than CAP Buttercream.  Waxiness is also more pronounced. I get intermittent still fairly faint dairy notes here.  Like sweet cream butter, as opposed to a richer diacteyl popcorn butter note.\n\nInhale is mostly dense sweetness.  Weird thing is, it's one the cleanest sweet notes I've got from a concentrate.  Like straight sugar syrup. Exhale brings in what I get from the dairy note.  Sweet, non cheesy butter.  Clear sweetness here too.  I could be imagining it, but the sweetness kind of has a really thin vanilla character to it.  Lingering waxy mouthfeel.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  The entire thing? For me at least this isn't really butter, but a thick unctuous sweetness. That unctuous vibe gets waxy really quick.\n\n**Throat Hit:** 0/10.\n\n**Uses:** Dense, rich, thick mouthfeel for creams and cream mixes.  If you get butter from this, then sweet cream butter notes for your bakeries.\n\n**Pairings:** If you get butter, relatively dry pastries. If you get buttercream frosting, then the world is your oyster.  Just don't expect it to translate for any given other person.\n\n**Notes:** I'm absolutely convinced there is something here that I'm not tasting.  This shouldn't be as subtle as is, both as the steeped tester and the S&V percentage testing.  Given the reaction on CAP Butter Cream, I don't think I'm alone.  I get a much clearer butter taste out of something like Cap Vanilla Whipped Cream.  As with anything, it's worth trying this as a single flavor first to see what you're getting out of this.\n\nS&V tasting, I get an almost identical level of actual dairy from this at .5% as I do at 4%.  Sweetness does seem a lot more linear, rising up to 6%. Waxiness seems to show up early, and plateaus at around 4%.  Given that I'm missing something here I would follow the recommendations in the second opinions and start low with this.  .5% to start and work up.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Seems like /u/avtomal5150/ got about the same thing from this as I did.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/4o6a74/looking_for_the_most_diketonerich_preferably/)\n\n[Differing opinions on ELR Notes, Primarily the heavy butter camp.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/1225)\n\n[Seems like some more mixed opinions on Vaping Underground](http://vapingunderground.com/threads/looking-for-a-good-tasting-butter-flavor-yes-i-know-they-have-diacetyl.121442/)\n\nSo, overall I'm stumped here.

Exhale brings out an almost marshmallow vanilla note shot through with cinnamon. Fluffy.  Light, sweet, and slightly grainy exhale, especially on the tail end. Dryer than you'd think something this sweet and fully flavored would be.  Nothing too rich here.  Almost an astringent lingering taste from the cinnamon.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Capellas bakery cinnamon notes taste a bit sour and metallic to me.  I get the same thing with Cinnamon Danish Swirl. Something creamy will take care of it pretty quickly though. More heat also seems to help.\n\n**Throat Hit:** 2/10.  Pretty inoffensive, especially considering the cinnamon here.\n\n**Uses:** Well, uhhh... things that use graham crackers.  Your smores and cheesecakes, etc.  Also used pretty heavily with custards to give an extra dimension of flavor.  Lots of mentions of using this in commercial clones.  Extra volume and cinnamon in bakeries. Try a little in pretty much any mix that the cinnamon won't throw off or that isn't going to be hurt by some dryness.  Would work as a tobacco enhancer for the right blend.\n\n**Pairings:** Anything? VBIC, Custards, Cheesecakes, Berries.  I'd stay away from already dry mixes but other than that knock yourself out.  I've seen talk about adding some butter to make this a bit richer.  Maybe AP to boost the graininess.\n\n**Notes:**  S&V tastes pretty linear up to 6%.  I think it would blend even at that level, but you'd be adding a ton of other concentrates to take the edge off of this one. I'd stick with an accent at 3% or under.  That cinnamon note isn't great, and I wouldn't want it standing out front.  The dryness would also be problematic. Blends really well at lower percentages though.  I'm obviously being a little trite when I suggest \"anything\" as a pairing but you'd be hard pressed to find something where this flavor wouldn't work.  The texture is the bigger issue, and so you want a thicker, sweet, creamy (dairy or not) base for this stuff to play off of.\n\nMakes a room smell awesome, for what that's worth.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[ELR flavor page, again.

Exhale brings out some sourness and bitterness with a citrus rind sting.  Well balanced if a bit simple grapefruit. Kind of tastes like the missing link between FW Blood Orange and FW Ruby Red Grapefruit.  It could just be the sourness but I get a mild bit of effervescence here.\n\n**Off-flavors:** None.\n\n**Throat Hit:** 7/10.  It's there, but not out of line for a citrus.\n\n**Uses:** Accent flavor for fruit mixes.  Volume for a citrus mix.  Effervescence would lend itself to something like Grapefruit soda or a cocktail recipe. \n\n**Pairings:**  I'd stay away from bright harsh flavors like green apples and pears. Berries, Pineapple, Guava, Pomegranate.  Creams.  Too bright and harsh for bakeries, or spices. Cactus for juiciness.\n\n**Notes:** This is pretty solid.  I had a vial hidden in some older supplies from a Wizard Labs order and decided to give it a shot.  Apparently the market is lousy with decent to good grapefruit concentrates.  I still prefer FLV Pink Guava for an interesting grapefruit, and FW Ruby Red Grapefruit for a more robust sweet grapefruit juice.  This has real potential though, especially is the carbonation holds up in a mix.  It tastes more like a sweetened white grapefruit, instead of an inherently sweet ruby red grapefruit.  All in all, a really pleasant surprise.  4% seems like a really solid single flavor percentage.  The bitter notes are fairly subdued for a grapefruit, so at lower percentages it should add to a mix without being too distracting.  Unobtrusive and tasty.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Reddit agrees CAP Grapefruit is... ok.

There is some syrupy cheap grenadine sweetness in there, but the first thing you notice is a face full of those weird, harsh, gasoline or plastic off notes that are depressingly common from cherry flavors. Good grenadine is basically pomegranate syrup, and I can't really taste anything resembling pomegranates.  Tastes more like bright red maraschino cherry syrup.

The flavor itself reminds me of something like passionfruit.  It's sort of a vague tropical note that really supports almost any fruit you add it to.\n\nIt also reminds me of FA Oba Oba, not in the way it tastes but the way it works.  I'd be hard pressed to figure out a way to make this a top note in any juice you mix it with.  It sort of sits under your other flavors and bridges some of the gaps.  Like Oba Oba, it won't ever be a star, but it makes everything around it better.  \n\nActually, come to think of it, I think it would be a close analogue to something like TFA Honeysuckle, with less pronounced floral top notes.\n\nPercentage is tricky with this. 4% seems like a solid main note, but adding brighter and sharper flavors will stomp all over it and take the flavor in some unpleasant directions.  The sweetness can quickly become overwhelming when paired with another strong sweet flavor at a high percentage.  I'd stick to 1% to 2% as an accent and emulsifier.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nThere's a variety of the plant named \"Turk's Cap Hibiscus\" so my google-fu is basically wrekt.\n\n[u/HocusKrokus/ gets a much stronger floral note from this than I do but still enjoys it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/4t7z6g/some_notes_on_florals/)\n\n[u/tet5uo/ posted an interesting recipe with 6% Cap Hibiscus which looks to use citrus and spice notes to balance the pronounced sweetness](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/2jy59y/first_crack_at_a_hibiscus_jamaica_rumpunch/)\n\n[5 Stars all the way on ECX.

Very soft and rather thick mouthfeel.  Comes off as a sort of vanilla custard or pudding but with an unmistakable milkiness reminiscent of soft white rice in an actual horchata drink.  The cinnamon is subtle enough to not be harsh after a short steep and the nuts do not over-power anything either.  It is rather well balanced IMO.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  nothing \"off\" to me in terms of a horchata, but may become \"eggy\" or just weird if you push the % too high.\n\n**Throat hit:** 6/10\n\n**Uses:**  Great as a base for your favorite dessert or holiday spice type recipes.  I would recommend staying below 6% in a mix to avoid harshness or a weird egg note.\n\n**Pairings:**  Other creams (especially vanilla), chocolate, butterscotch, caramel, cookie, bourbon/whiskey, coffee, or your preferred cinnamon flavoring if you find this one to be lacking in that department.  Would also work well with apple, pear, or other fruits commonly used in baking something with cinnamon.\n\n**Notes:**   To me, this is a rather under-rated flavoring.  I enjoy the somewhat exotic taste I get from the cinnamon/spice/nut part of it.  It is pretty versatile with many other dessert type flavorings.  Not a lot of recipes around here using horchata, but that may change as the holiday season rolls around.  \n\n[Wikipedia link to horchata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horchata)\n\nEDIT: [Link to all of our flavor reviews in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** CAP Jelly Candy@ 4%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 25 days for the solo, At least 3 days for the mixes.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Solo, this has a light soapy taste.  Not super dense but really fluffy mouthfeel.  Little bit of residual stickiness. But this isn't a flavor, per se.  It's primarily a textural additive so I've tried it with the leftovers of some testers I had.  I figured it was enough to get a feel for how this works since the flavor tests are pretty recent in my mind.\n\n[2% CAP Sweet Mango](https://redd.it/5evnjd), Jelly Candy @ 2%: Really nice. Takes off the rancid edge on the mango.  Thins and fluffs out the juice, while Peel notes are quite a bit cleaner.  You can taste just a bit of the soapyness but it does do a job of giving you a jelly candy. Not a taffy, hi-chew, or starbust kind of chewy, more like the real pectin-based fruit jellies.  As the wicks dry I get more a raw white sugar taste.\n\n[2% CAP Sweet Guava](https://redd.it/5dsxqk), Jelly Candy @ 2%:  Really pushes the perfume notes forward.  Takes that deep sweetness and makes it a little thinner and taste raw.  Thins out the mouthfeel considerably while getting some lingering stickyness and pretty clear soapy taste.  Avoid perfumey fruits.\n\n[3% CAP Cranberry](https://redd.it/5epm04), Jelly Candy @ 1%: Pops those top notes quite a bit.  Fluffs the fruit up and makes the entire thing seem a bit more robust.  1% as an additive seems to work really well with dark fruits.  Takes this quite a bit closer to a real cranberry.  Soapy notes work well the cranberry to give a more realistic flavor.  Mouthfeel difference is positive here. Really nice almost gummy taste.  Really seems to up vapor production as well.\n\n[3% CAP Cantaloupe](https://redd.it/5e5xqv), Jelly Candy @1%: Makes the top notes here taste a lot more realistic.  Doesn't really make this juicy, per se. Just makes the perfumey top notes taste a whole lot more realistic and brings a relatively dry fluffiness with a bit of an unctuous mouthfeel.  This is a winner.  Perfume notes linger a bit longer than without the JC.\n\n[3% CAP Cool Mint](https://redd.it/5dz19n), Jelly Candy @ 1%: Really bumps the vanilla here.  This is actually pretty cool. The mint portion of this also hits the palate a lot cleaner.  Really enhances this.  The soap notes disappear under the aspartame taste on the back end.  This is strangely awesome.\n\n[3.5% CAP Vanilla Whipped Cream](https://redd.it/5f70za), Jelly Candy @ .5%:  I was really ready to call this gross.  It's not. Annihilates the dairy note here.  Tastes quite a bit like a strangely realistic marshmallow.  One of the fancy botique marshmallows that get cut into squares. Again, pops that vanilla right to the forefront.  Cuts the buttery mouthfeel.  Soap notes show through on the end.  I don't think is good, but it sure is interesting.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Yeah, that vaguely soapy thing.  Not really full on soap, but like a glass of water after a dishwasher did a poor job of actually rinsing your dishes.\n\n**Throat Hit:** 3/10.  Really odd though, it cuts the harshness from the harsher flavors and adds it own to the smooth flavors.  Seems to just replace whatever mouthfeel from the concentrate you're using it with.\n\n**Uses:**  To give a fluffy jelly candy vibe to fruit.  Maybe to push vanilla in non-cream fruit mixes.  Someone more creative than I am will have to figure this out.\n\n**Pairings:**  Dark, jammy fruits.  These seem to work the best.  It cuts the thickness and accentuates the top notes.  This actually works really well with vanilla, again pushing those brighter top notes. Stay away from perfumey or sharp fruits.  This just destroys dairy notes, so avoid creams.\n\n**Notes:**  Weird, but pretty cool. I'd suggest using this starting at .5% up to 2% depending on how dark your fruit is.  With some really sketchy back of the envelope math, I mixed about 1% Jelly Candy, 3% Cranberry, and 1% Vanilla Whipped Cream.  It's kind of awesome.  The top notes on the cranberry and vanilla are great, and the fluffy mouthfeel is spot on.  No cream on the VWC here to speak of. This has some real potential to \"bend\" flavors, as the cool kids seem to be saying.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[ELR Flavor notes.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/71061)  Not sure where it came from, but multiple say this: \"add to fresh fruit flavors to give them more weight, vibrancy, and that candied fruit taste. Allows the fruits to really stand out when also using creams and custards. Use at 1%, maybe 1.5%, otherwise if you use too much it will taste chalky & astringent. Gets plasticy and chalky really quick 1-2% in mix MAX good candy note.\"  Seems dead on.\n\nSome quick reddit mentions [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/4ltzxb/flavor_of_the_week_candy/), [here](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwiWiv7Y2tjQAhVK72MKHYwuAIUQFgggMAE&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2FDIY_eJuice%2Fcomments%2F4sc1i6%2Fcapella_strawberry_taffy_and_gummy_candy_thoughts%2F&usg=AFQjCNGqoQG0DU42QVlvZocrlyit3ypOgA&sig2=exZJM_rP4j6iNe9KRPB6sw) and [here.](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=3&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwiWiv7Y2tjQAhVK72MKHYwuAIUQFggmMAI&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2FDIY_eJuice%2Fcomments%2F4l6agd%2Fcapella_new_flavors%2F&usg=AFQjCNG4Tq1Gh5HWIA52aI-FK5K1s_-Duw&sig2=QMbCEpajmOQa5Lv3suQfAg)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Juiciness comes out a bit on exhale. Pretty straightforward out of season navel orange flavor with a solid sweetness.  Almost an orange perfume type of vibe, over a sweetener.  Just a hint of pithy bitterness on the tail end of the exhale after the sweetness fades out. Lingering citric almost tannic dryness.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Not a flavor per se, but this gets waxy.  Seems to be pretty consistent through temperature range.\n\n**Throat Hit:** 7/10.  Doesn't seem that bad, but builds quickly and is pervasive.  Also strangely inconsistent.  The throat hit comes and goes.  Tightens my throat up with extended use.\n\n**Uses:** Primary use seems to be top notes for orange juice blends. Sweet and thin enough to play well with milk chocolates, using it like an orange essence. Flavor tastes a lot like what they'd use in something like a chocolate orange. Creamsicle-type orange flavors.\n  \n**Pairings:** Sweeter citrus, especially FA Mandarin and CAP Sweet Tangerine.  Lemon Sicily, or a sweeter lime like Key Lime or INW Lime.  I'd stay from fruit and citrus that builds on that throat hit. Sweet tropical fruit. Medium creams, like FA Fresh Cream or FLV Cream.  Your favorite smooth milk chocolate flavor. Sweet berries.\n\n**Notes:**  Pretty realistic, not great orange. Like a school lunch navel orange flavor.  I wouldn't call this a juicy orange, although it tastes a lot like orange juice.  Or the essence of orange juice without all of the acidic body and overwhelming sugar.  No real rind, or bright citrus oil type of flavor.  That throat hit though.  This flavor is tempting, but even at 2% that throat hit becomes a defining characteristic of a mixed juice.  If you could deal with the throat hit, it's useful.  I can't.\n\n[*CONSPIRACY THEORY TIME...* This is like what they add to storage orange juice to bring back the top notes.](http://www.foodrenegade.com/secret-ingredient-your-orange-juice/)\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n/U/matthewkocanda/ [calls it weak, but points out throat hit and waxiness at higher percentages.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/4fr24a/elod_v1_orange_pineapple_banana_juice/)\n\n[No love on ECX. 4 reviews, 2 star average.

The fuller body part of the orange flavor is definitely on the weak side, but that perfumey orange note is pretty unmistakable even at lower percentages.  I'd use this a lot like /u/matthewkocanda at a relatively low percentage and get my sweet orange body from something else.  Or just skip it entirely and use FW Blood Orange.  Found some scattered accounts of using this closer to 15% in a juice.  These people are lunatics.\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** CAP Juicy Peach @ 4%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 7 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  A relatively complex artificial peach flavor. Slight perfume notes, but a moderately thick full \"peach.\" Reminds me of the kind of flavoring they'd use in a canned ice tea or mid-grade flavored vodka.  Little bit of a a sticky mouthfeel, but nothing approaching gummy. Sweet, but not aggressively so.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Subtle chemical notes.  A little bitter and astringent, but pretty manageable.  Some added fruit will help mask those flavors effectively.\n\n**Throat Hit:** 3/10.  Can get a little bitter and seems to tighten my throat up a bit with extended use.  Absolutely nothing compared to TFA Juicy Peach, for me at least.  \n\n**Uses:** Peach body, with a more floral and aggressive Peach. Candy peach recipes.  Would mix well in a straight fruit recipe. Probably a bit too artificial for bakeries.  Would work well when you are trying to impart a commercial \"peach\" flavor to things like Ice Tea or cheaper peach ice creams.\n\n**Pairings:**  More complex, earthier fruits to add some complexity and some sweetness.  Peach mixes with damn near every fruit I can think of.  Should work unobtrusively with creams, ice creams, custards, etc.  Candy texturizers.\n\n**Notes:** Another reminder to steep your juice, even if it's just a straight fruit. This starts out super floral and kind of a chemical mess.  That seems to be a running theme with the peaches I've tried. I like CAP's \"juicy\" line just because they provide some pretty straight-forward, if not particularly complex, flavors that mix well.  I'd consider this a good \nlowest-common-denominator peach.  It won't change your life or anything, but it gives you a clear, unmistakable, sort of artificial peach without the throat-hit of TFA Juicy Peach, or the pronounced floral notes and sharpness of FA White Peach.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[ELR Flavor Description](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/11190)\n\n[Redditor fucking hates it](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/53j4gj/difference_between_juicy_peach_tfacap/)\n\n[Vaping Underground forums: Bitter AF](http://vapingunderground.com/threads/for-all-the-peach-lovers-out-there.229834/)\n\nI'm more positive on this flavor than other people.  People seem to be lumping in with TFA Juicy Peach, but I think it's fairly different.  Throat hit doesn't even seem comparable.  Flavor is similar, but I like this execution quite a bit more.  \n\nThis also doesn't taste like canned peaches to me.  It has some of sweetness, and the mouthfeel, but ultimately it's too perfumy and artificial to read as canned or cooked in any way.\n\nAs to bitterness, it's there.  I kind of like how it sets off the flavor, but my palette runs towards the bitter, so caveat emptor I guess.  I don't find it unpleasant at all. \n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**\n\n**META:** I plan on doing some reviews to bolster the DIY_eJuice flavor reviews section.  A lot of these are going to be older, and more established flavors.  With the sheer number of flavors available, I would definitely like to have something a bit more comprehensive as a resource for mixers.  I think flavors catch hype and become de facto standards.  Instead of relying on sketchy documentation and second-hand information about what works, I want to have an archivable list of flavors considered in whatever context myself and other people can provide.  This may be folly, but I think it is an interesting exercise and, as long as my notes are useful, I'll keep posting them.\n\nMy tastebuds can get fatigued, so my process for these notes include trying a reference juice first to make sure my palette is working well and is loosely \"calibrated\" to whatever the hell it normally is.",

Relatively dark or heavy flavor for a kiwi, as opposed to a bright, tart, kiwi. Mouthfeel is bit dry, but very sweet overall. \n\nInhale is dense, with some deep, very sweet, apple or pear notes.  Beginning of the exhale tastes like gummy strawberries, or a green haribo gummy bear.  Tail end is more like that candy bartlett pear skin type of taste, with just a bit of brightness and some green non-vegetal top notes balancing out some deep pear sweetness.  Sweet but dry overall, with a moderate density. Tastes reasonably like a candy kind of kiwi flavor, but I don't get the melon kind of base that really makes a kiwi for me.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Nothing bad, just a bit dry and pear-heavy for a real kiwi.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Light, mostly from the drier taste. Not particularly juicy or smooth.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Kiwi is one of those flavors that shares elements of a lot of other fruits, so you have a fair amount of mixing options.  Strawberries and melons (especially honeydew) are a great fit, but darker berries should work as long as they aren't too syrupy.  Almost has a bit of a passionfruit taste with the strawberry in here, so tropical fruits are also on the table, especially fa banana.\n\nMixing with creams, I'd keep it light and fluffy.  This is pretty sweet overall, so something like CAP Vanilla Whipped Cream should take advantage of the sweetness without being bogged down by the heavier flavor here.  Sort of in the same vein, would pair well with coconut as well.\n\nI'd take advantage of that bartlett pear skin thing, and use it at a low percentage on top of FA Pear for a more realistic full pear if you're into that thing.  Or even for a green apple mix to add a bit of depth and interest.\n\nWorks well with candy texturizers, and has the sweetness to carry a candy flavor with just enough brightness to make it pop a bit.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nS&V Concentration testing, .5% is really light in flavor, but still pretty heavily sweet.  Should work as a fruit sweetener.  1% actually tastes a bit more like a kiwi then higher concentrations, with all of those component flavors still really light, but the sweetness is still dominant here.  Could definitely pass as a lighter candy strawberry here.  At 1.5%, I'm getting a lot of pear as those greener, bright notes start to creep in. 2% is a getting a little flat and heavy, and by 3% you've got a murkier \"candy\" flavor overall. By 3%, you start to notice the dryness. 4% seems pretty sugary, and your green notes have mellowed out and you get a dense almost overripe pear sweetness.  I'd use this at .75% for a fruit sweetener, 1.5% for mixes trying to evoke a bartlett pear or green apple, and 2.5% for mixes where you want something approaching a kiwi. I'd go up to 3.5 or 4% for a base for a candy recipe, knowing it'll taste a little more pear than kiwi.\n\nOverall, this doesn't really scream Kiwi to me. FA Kiwi is brighter and more vibrant, and definitely heavier on the strawberry kind of notes that make it awesome.  I think this has some serious potential in pear flavors though, and at lower percentages it shouldn't be distracting in any kind of fruit mix you come up with.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nI can't find much, so not really.\n\n[Instead, have some Capella website copy:](http://www.capellaflavors.com/products/kiwi-flavor-concentrate-13ml.html)\n\n\"New Kiwi Flavor Concentrate from Capella Flavors. The taste of kiwi fruit, which varies from sweet to tart, is reminiscent of strawberries, nectarines and melons, yet with its own unique sweet flavor.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** CAP Lime @ %3, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 8 days.\n\n*This concentrate was provided by bullcityflavors.com, for the sole and express purpose of publishing an honest review for r/DIY_eJuice.*\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Seems about halfway between An actual lime and margarita mix.  I could see this as a key lime flavor if the pitch was convincing. Lots of fairly realistic lime zest top notes, with a funky lime juice bordering on \"green\" candy type of body. Above 2%, tastes a lot like a fruity pebbles/fruit loops kind of lime.  Not just the lime half of CAP Lemon-Lime, has a much more prominent lime zest flavor.\n\nInhale is pretty clean. Lime candy sweetness and not a lot else.  Small hint of a tart zest flavor.  Flat and deep sweetness, interesting for a citrus. Exhale has a sweet lime juice base with some pretty heavy bitter realistic lime zest top notes.  Lingering bitter lime zest finish with just a bit of that sugary sweet mouthfeel.  Sweetness overall is noticeable but not distracting. Almost pushes into a slightly oversweetened limeade.  Maybe a slight hit of carbonation, but nothing like FA Aurora or FA Distilled Lime.  Mouthfeel is a bit thin, but not too sharp or chemical to push into straight astringency.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Lime juice taste on the exhale tastes just a bit oxidized or fermented. Like when you get lazy and buy the bottled lime juice, use some and then promptly Forget about if for 6 months and rediscover it when making a desperation margarita.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light, a noticeable throat tightness instead of a real harshness.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  A good, straight ahead lime flavor.  I'd say this would work just about anywhere you'd want a lime, except in situations where you want the carbonation from something like FA Aurora or FA Lime Distilled.\n\nReally good for fruit mixes, seems to pair really well with other fruit flavors without getting too astringent or distracting. Quick S&V testing with FA Raspberry, FLV Mango, and FA Apricot and I'm not getting any weird off-notes or strange interactions. Tastes a lot like adding lime to those concentrates, which is a good thing.\n\nDecent lime for bakeries, giving you a heavy zest flavor without skewing the entire thing too lime-jello.\n\nMy brain my have been invaded by the capella marketing copy, but seems like a good fit for a margarita-mix kind of effect in a cocktail mix especially with that vaguely fermented note.\n\nNot sure if this is what you want for a candy lime, just because FLV Lime does the tarter \"green\" flavor so well and INW Lime does a fuller, sweeter lime flavor really well.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nS&V concentration testing, at .5% I get mostly sweet and warm oxidized/ lightly fermented lime juice. Zest flavor is pretty subdued.  1% brings in some lighter hints of zest and fills out the profile a bit.  1.5% and above just ramps up that zest, with the zest reading as pretty bitter and full by 2.5%. By 4% you have a more candy lime and the sweetness just takes off. I'd mix with this at 1% in fruit mixes, and bump it up to 2.5% if you want to go zest heavy for either a cocktail recipe or a bakery.\n\nAnother fundamentally decent lime option, although it's hard to pick out a situation where this is going to shine.  A lime for fruit mixes and umbrella drinks.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nI can't find much, so not really.\n\n[FWIW, here's the Capella website copy:](http://www.capellaflavors.com/products/lime-flavor-concentrate-13ml.html)\n\n\"Zesty and Zingy.\n\nCapella Flavors new Lime Flavor has the perfect \"zing\" you are looking for.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Cap Marshmallow (The \"new\" kind) @ 3%. 60/40 VG/PG, steeped 34 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  More of a texturizer than an actual marshmallow flavor. Some really light vanilla, but mostly dry sweet volume. I get a really prominent chemical off-note from this entire concentrate, so it's a bit tricky to balance the volume you want with trying to stay away from that chemical taste.\n\nInhale is bitter with a chemical kind of astringency.  Fairly thick though, with a almost granulated sugar kind of dry sweetness.  Exhale has some flat vanilla top notes, but that chemical taste soaks through the entire vape.  Dry, sweet, and dense body.  Overall effect is pretty harsh.  That chemical taste lingers and turns bitter at the tail end of the vape. \n\n**Off-flavors:**  I get a pretty heavy chemical taste from this solo. Brighter or creamy flavors help to mask it a bit, but even mixed it ends up showing up. Ends up being really good at pushing grassy notes to the forefront of mixes.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Moderate. The dryness and density here gets a bit scratchy on the throat, and that chemical astringency aggravates it a bit. Not unvapeable or anything, but not really pleasant solo.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This stuff doesn't really taste a whole lot like a marshmallow.  Either TFA or FA is a better choice if you want something that actually reads marshmallow. This stuff does a decent job of acting as a texturizer for other flavors, adding some fluff and volume without too drastically changing the other flavors it's mixed with.  Use with thicker creams and brighter fruits. Not to put too fine a point on it, but I don't want to actually taste this in a juice.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nIn terms of usage percentage, I'm going to double down on using this a texturizer and not a discrete flavor. To that end, I've just mixed up 1% FA Raspberry and 3% TFA Cheesecake (Graham Crust) and it's okay. Nothing too fancy. Light raspberry, heavy graham cracker. At .5%, I get a slightly fluffy texture, mostly in the the graham taste. Not a whole lot of cream to start with, but this is definitely drying out the vape and giving it more texture.  I get just a hint of that chemical astringency, it's making the raspberry taste a bit floral compared to the reference. At 1% Marshmallow, the mix is getting really fluffy, and that graham is better integrated into the overall mix. Raspberry isn't noticeably more floral than .5%, but I'm getting a clear chemical hit on the back end. That should die down a bit on a long steep, though. At 1.5% this is getting really fluffy, but maybe just a bit muted. The chemical off-taste doesn't seem more pronounced that at 1%.  At 2%, I'm getting some of that chemical note on the inhale and some definite muting. Volume doesn't seem to have gone up much from 1.5%. Vanilla is starting to come in as well.  2.5% is getting distinctly chemical, and I'm not getting anything beneficial over 2%.  Personally, I'd recommend starting with this at 1% and working up at .25% increments. It'll also probably require at least week steep to settle down a bit, so it may add to your steep time with fruitier mixes.\n\nSo, just my $0.02 here... this isn't going to be a great choice for a marshmallow. Seems mostly useful as a texturizer. I like FA Marshmallow for an actual marshmallow flavor and TFA has a really dense nuetral body with almost a buttery overtone. Again, I'm not a huge CAP booster so YMMV.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Some talk on New vs. Old marshmallow.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/4wxcds/capella_new_marshmallow_anybody_tried_this_before/)\n\nKind of hard to discern what version of marshmallow the information out there is referring to. [BCF has a page specifically for new marshmallow, so it's a good place to start.](http://www.bullcityflavors.com/new-marshmallow-cap/)  Couple of decent reviews on there, but one just calls it a sweetener and there's a 2 star that says it smells like kerosene.\n\n[Here's the ELR Page.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/1292) Not super useful but a couple of people talk about a bitterness here.\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Capella Silverline Meringue, 4% and 8%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 10 days.\n**Flavor Description:**  Crunchberry cereal milk?\n\nThe meringue here feels more like mostly sweetness and texture rather than any real distinct flavor. Light maltiness more than a distinct bakery flavor. Capella says this is a cross between meringue and a meringue cookie, but I’m missing any real cookie notes. Fluffy and moderately dense, with a prominent sweetness.  Light dairy note here but it tastes more milky than creamy.  A lot closer to something like FA Fresh Cream than a richer dairy flavor. Doesn’t feel particularly crunchy, and nothing that tastes like a more toasted baked meringue.\n\nSo, that thing where people use FA Meringue for a cereal milk vibe?  It seems like Capella wanted us to hold their beer and they added crunchberries to it.   There’s something fruity in here and it really does taste a lot like that kind of generic red berry fruitiness of said crunchberries.  Nothing really distinct enough to nail down to a specific kind of red fruit, but that fruitiness kind of pervades the entire vape.  If this is a meringue, they steeped the thing with crunchberries before whipping the egg whites. \n\nSweetness level overall is fairly high.  Capella does say this has sucralose in it, and it could be the power of suggestion, but I do a get of a sweetener edge.  Just going off MSDS, this is 90-100% propelyne glycol, so it’s under 10% sucralose by volume.  For what it’s worth, I didn’t notice much real coil gore or wick carnage after vaping around 15ml of this. \n\nComparing this FA Meringue, I feel like the SL version seems a bit softer overall.  FA meringue has a drier “crunch” to it, and while this has some of the fluffy texture it doesn’t seem as dry to me.  FA meringue seems to have a more eggy taste and a clearer vanilla.  This feels a bit more netural except for that red fruit thing.\n\n**Off-Flavors:**  Generic red fruit flavor.  Sucralose pre-installed, so that might be an issue.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light? Doesn’t feel particularly dry but there is something a bit throaty with that berry thing.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 4%,  this doesn’t really come together for me.  Thinner, with a dry berry and malt taste. Doesn’t really feel full or fluffy. \n\nAt 8%, this is working substantially better.  A bit heavy on the sweetness, but the texture is working quite a bit better and soaking up those berry and malt notes well.  Doesn’t feel too dry or crunchy.\n\nJust based on these tests, this seems to be working quite a bit better higher.  Sucralose is a bit more prominent, but I’d be using this a base flavor somewhere between 8-10%. \n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  So, the cereal milk thing.  I’m not sure this has the “crunch” for the outside of cereal like FA Meringue, but it has some of the same malty vibe and that berry note is going to work well for fruitier cereals.  The thickness is also going to work for a milky or creamy profile.\n\nDoesn’t really feel dry enough for the powdered sugar on bakeries thing that FA Meringue does, but it feels like the texture would carry something like a pavlova or other meringue based desert with heavier bakery notes around it.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  Nothing much via the google yet. \n\n[Here is the product page from Capella.

I mostly just get something vague and sweet up front and a tart, sour finish.  No smoke or ash.  Sort of a moderately dry hay type of tobacco, but it's pretty light overall.  Maybe a light leathery note.  No darker leafy or herbal notes.  Reminds me a lot of the Liquid Barn tobaccos, and tastes especially close to their [Sweet Pipe Tobacco](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/7g92la/lb_sweet_pipe_tobacco/) with a slightly more aggressive tobacco note.\n\nSweetness feels a like FA Oba Oba, with that light marshmallow kind of note and a bit of that fluffier texture.  Pretty solidly sweet for a tobacco.  Sourness tastes kind of citric and thins out the back end of the exhale, punching the tobacco through that big wall of sweetness.\n\n**Off-Flavors:**  Sweeter, fluffier texture. Light on tobacco with a tart sourness.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light.  That tartness is a bit harsh but nothing crazy.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 4%, this is pretty non-descript.  Mostly just sweet.  Tart finish, with just a tiny bit of almost sour tobacco poking through.\n\nAt 8%, still pretty sweet but I am getting just a touch more tobacco.  On a scale of 1 to Black For Pipe, this is like a 3.  Tartness doesn't feel quite as sour and out of place here.\n\nJust based on these tests, I think you could safely drag this up to 10%+ if you wanted to run this as a solo flavor.  If you wanted to use this as a primary flavor, and add in some backup accent tobacco, I'd start around 6%.  Use at 3% as a sweet tobacco type additive.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Alright solo tobacco if you want a sweeter, lighter pipe tobacco.  \n\nSeems a bit tart to be used as a sweetener for heavier pipe tobaccos, especially something that already has a tobacco absolute vibe like the \"for pipe\" line by INW.\n\nCould work as an accent in non-aromatic tobacco blends for sweetness and body.\n\nTobacco is light, but still present enough that you're pretty limited to tobacco mixes with this.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  This is one of Capella's newer flavors.  I've heard horror stories about their original tobaccos, but their new burley, smokey, and original blend seem to have replaced them.\n\nI'm seeing nothing out there in terms of notes or reviews.\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

I read a lot of places that sour doesn't translate to vape. However a friend showed me a store bought juice they have and it was fairly sour, it tasted kinda like a sour mango. So I heard of the new cap sour and wanted to try it. \n\nIn the bottle it smells like fermented fruits which have been blended into a sour wine. \n\nTasting it on the back of my knuckles, it's definitely sour, and does taste like how it smells. It has a weird chemical taste on a final note. \n\nVaping it I tried it at various amounts to see just how 'powerful' it is. \n\n0.25% \nGetting slight notes of slightly old fruit. Not so much in the way of sour, just lots of VG sweetness. \n\n1%\nStill getting the fruit, less old fruit though, more like the 'sour' is balancing out the sweetness of the VG. It's almost like the stage of the warheads where you've gone through all of the sour and you're at the sweet stage and occasionally are reminded it once had sour on it. \n\n4%\nFeels like the old fermented fruits have come back. Has a tartness of white wine cross with a tart cider. Again sweeter than it is sour. It's just a fermented fruit flavour really. \n\nOverall it's more of a fermented fruit sour than it is powerful. As far as uses go, I'd recommend if you're wanting to make a sour beer or cider, it's going to give a fairly realistic sour fruits flavour, however it's definitely in no way a concentrate to make your flavours properly sour, as it is making a sour flavour or taste. \n\nIt's a confusing flavour to review and this is my first flavour test so hopefully it makes enough sense. Let me know if you've tried it higher or managed to somehow get a real sour effect from it. \n\n\n\nAfter thoughts, VG is very sweet, maybe doing this with more PG would have been more beneficial?",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** CAP SilverLine Rainbow Candy, 2 and 5%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 7 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Skittles, but missing a lot of the fruit flavor you'd expect. More of a sweet and tart skittles base, if that's a thing.\n\nThis doesn't exactly taste like Skittles, although it feels like it could maybe be the base for a skittles recipe.  There's a dry, slightly chalky texture in here, along with a whole lot of tartness.  It feels brighter and tarter than just a citrus skittles flavor.  The inhale and exhale are both fairly well dominated by that tartness, and I'm getting a decent amount of throat hit from it.  The texture beneath that tartness is on the dryer side overall.  More like a sweet-tart than a chewier skittles type mouthfeel, although adding a syrupy fruit would probably turn it into something substantially chewier.  Seems to already have some kind of candy sweetness built in, but it isn't really attached to the body here.\n\nIt tastes like there is some kind of fruit flavor in here, but it's relatively light compared to that overwhelming tart base.  I pick up mostly lime and a bit of artificial kool-aid type grape flavor.  The tartness here really pushes that lime note right toward the front.  I maybe get a sweeter orange, and then grape comes in on the back.  Those fruit flavors aren't particularly saturated, and lead to a pretty unsatisfying solo vape.\n\nThe only other strictly skittles concentrate I have to compare this with is an ancient bottle of FW Skittles Type.  The FW Version is quite a bit heavier on fruit.  Granted, it's still really lime and lemon forward, but the actual fruit flavor is quite a bit stronger and more vibrant.  Texture is a little lacking though.  FWIW, mixing some of the FW Skittles and CSL Rainbow Candy actually produced something that a had a decent base and a brighter artificial skittles flavor.  It sounds like this would be a closer match to FW Sweet and Tart.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  More of a candy base than full skittles flavor.  Nothing tastes chemical or off here at usable percentages.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Moderate to harsh solo.  Gets a bit dry overall, and that tartness has a kick to it.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 2% I get a decent candy tartness without too much else going on.  Extremely light fruit flavor, and maybe a little bit of that sweet, chalky body.\n\nThe tartness here is actually a little overwhelming at 5%.  Seems fairly close to a \"sour\" type flavor up this high, but nothing here tastes chemical or off.  I'm also getting that dryer, sweet body.  Fruit flavor is still really light.  Sort of like vaping the leftover sugar from a bag of sour skittles.\n\nI gave this a shot up higher at 8% and it was a little too tart and harsh for me, and it didn't seem to solve the fruit issue.\n\nJust based on these tests, I think this one is fairly versatile in terms of percentage.  My usage would probably be dictated on exactly how tart I wanted, but I could see this working as a lighter tart accent at 2% and up to 6% as a more aggressive additive.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Not a solo skittles vape, although mixing it with FW Skittles got me fairly close.\n\nI'd use this more as a candy tart additive.  Should help to give some sugary body and some bright tartness to juicier fruit flavors.  I don't think the little amount of fruit here is going to clash with any other kind of fruit, but it's going to be a bit distracting in non-fruit profiles.\n\nShould work well either the 27 bears or 27 fish to give a tarter, sour edge to gummy candies.\n\nUse case will probably be fairly close to FW Sweet and Tart.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  Still fairly new.\n\n[Shoutout to ceedee99uk for linking reviews from PeegoreVapes in another thread.](https://peegorevapes.wordpress.com/2017/10/04/capella-silver-line-affordable-flavours/)\n\n[Here's the product page from Capella.](http://www.capellaflavors.com/products/27-bears-flavor-concentrate.html)  Their description: \"This hard-shelled chewy treat is a bold new Silverline flavor.

Florals are under control, but their isn't all that much raspberry there.  Pretty flat and cardboardish. 2% is still floral forward with some realtively weak syrupy raspberry candy behind it.  3% is heavily floral, but that raspberry is getting more pronounced. 4% and 5% are pretty much the same. The raspberry and the florals seems to be scaling up at about the same rate. \n\nIt's been a while since I've had Capella Raspberry v1, but I this doesn't seem drastically different than my previous experience. My notes on it were very brief and talked about a syrupy raspberry that went way too floral.  I figured I'd give the v2 a shot because I'm a big fan of raspberry and figured it could be decent.  I'd personally avoid this one, although it would make a decent sub if you can't get the CAP Raspberry v1 for whatever reason.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Some comparison between v1 and v2](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/3kebew/cap_raspberry_v1_vs_v2/)\n\n[Not a lot of help on ELR, some people calling it fresh tasting, some people calling it candy.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/17649)\n\nCouple glowing reviews on [ECX](http://www.ecigexpress.com/diy-e-liquid/diy-e-liquid-flavors/capella-flavor-drops/raspberry-v2-capella-flavor-drops.html#review-list) and [BCF](http://www.bullcityflavors.com/raspberry-v2-cap/).

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Capella Smokey Tobacco, 4% and 8%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 40 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  A sweet base, light leathery tobacco, and a moderate cigarette smoke type finish.\n\nMuch like their [Original Blend](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/7ylse9/capella_original_blend_tobacco/), this still feels fairly sweet.  Same kind of slightly fluffy FA Oba Oba body to this.  Sweetness seems more concentrated in the front of the vape, with all the more traditional tobacco parts of the vape coming out on the back half of the exhale.\n\nMore smoke than tobacco here.  I do get something slightly leathery here, but doesn't really seem to have much of an herbal leaf flavor.  I could see something like that sour hay from the original blend hiding out in here, but with all that sweetness and the smoke it's hard to really pick up clearly.\n\nThe smoke here is really interesting.  It has some of that more neutral campfire smoke vibe of FA Black FIre, but with those leathery notes it's doing a pretty good job of coming across like actual burning cigarette paper.  There's also just a bit of that that dirtier, ashier, and slightly grassy INW Dirty Neutral Base kind of base to it as well.  Seems like basically the middle point of those types of smokier flavors and works pretty well.\n\n**Off-Flavors:**  Still seems pretty sweet for a tobacco flavor, with a slightly fluffy texture.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light, nothing major.  Smoke can get a bit overbearing solo, but not really all that harsh.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 4% this is pretty solidly sweet.  Not quite fluffy, but the sweetness comes across as a bit candied.   Tobacco is showing up but feels a bit swamped by that sweetness. Smoke here seems pretty limited to the finish.\n\nAt 8% this is dryer and fluffier.  Doesn't seem all that much more sweet.  Tobacco is actually maybe a bit less prominent than at 4%, but the smoke is a lot more prominent.  It's kind of taken over some of the tobacco's space here.  Getting both that sweeter campfire type smoke and that slightly dirty, ashy backend.  Sour character from the tobacco really punches it in at the end.\n\nJust based on these tests, this is on the weaker side.  I'd be up around 5% for an accent in a tobacco mix, or up to 10% as a solo flavor.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Seems a bit sweet for a solo tobacco vape, but if that's your thing this has a bit of nuance past all that sweetness.\n\nI'd primarily be using this an additive or secondary tobacco in a tobacco profile that needs both sweetness and texture, and that middle of the road cigarette smoke vibe.  I don't think you'll be able to get either the smoke or sweetness out of this without the other parts tagging along.\n\nSeems to need a bolder, less sweet non-aromatic tobacco flavor to accent.  I'd pick something darker and leafy, and let this sweeten it up and add a smoke note.  I'm not sure that cigarette profiles are really sweet, but at least the smoke here really seems cigarette-like.\n\nCould work well for a cheaper flavored cigar kind of recipe.\n\n**Second Opinions:** Nah, not seeing anything out there.\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Not as dry/crunchy of a mouth feel as FA Cookie, but more like a thinner cookie baked so the outside crunches the slightest bit, yet the inside remains soft.\n\n**Off-flavors:** I'm getting a bit of anise or strong dark spice, reminiscent of something like FA Nonna's Cake but nowhere NEAR as strong.

This is what I imagine macerating ripe currants in sugar and drinking the liquid at the bottom of the vessel would taste like. There’s enough natural fruit character to keep this from being what I would consider a candy flavor. \n\n**Off Flavors:** None. \n\n**Mouthfeel:** I usually add a touch of Inawera Cactus to my fruit recipes, but I don’t think Sweet Currant needs it. It’s got an inherent juiciness as a solo flavor. Also, no sweetener is required, at least not for me. \n\n**Throat Hit:** None. \n\n**Uses:** Since it’s such a realistic flavor, I could see this being an awesomely me pairing with pie and other bakery recipes. Pairing it with other fruits, especially citrus, seems like another obvious choice. \n\n**Conclusion:** This is a 10/10 for me. It’s so realistic that I’d be more than happy to vape it exclusively as a solo flavor mix. That said, I’m really looking forward to mixing it with some other stuff to see how it behaves.",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** CAP Sweet Guava @ 4%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 12 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Immediately sweet inhale with some slightly astringent, grassy perfume notes that build with heat. Dense, sticky exhale.  Deep juicy canned guava nectar flavor carries through from inhale to beginning of exhale.  Round, full sweetness.  Sticky mouthfeel lingers along those perfume notes.\n\nA nondescript sweet tropical flavor.  Light grassy almost mango peel from the top notes. Tastes like just the difference between a tart white grapefruit and sweet ruby-red grapefruit mixed with an overripe and bland banana if that makes sense.\n\n**Off-flavors:** It depends on how you want to use the concentrate.  If you want a realistic guava, way too sweet. It you want a guava nectar, those grassy top notes may get in the way, especially in combination with fruits that have a strong peel flavor.\n\n**Throat Hit:** 2/10.  Just a hint of harshness from those top notes.\n\n**Uses:**  Works as an emulsifier for disparate fruits. Base for creamy tropical fruit flavors. \n  \n**Pairings:** Bright but not floral fruits, Strawberries, Raspberries, Pineapple, Mango, Passionfruit. Sweeter citrus. Grapefruit. Hops for a bitter counter-point. Non-sweet creams.  Probably too sweet and heavy for prominent use in ice cream or rich custards.  I'd avoid nuts, bakeries, and tobacco.  Too sweet for chocolates.\n\n**Notes:**  At low percentages (1-2%) this should mix with just about anything.  At higher percentages it really does blend extremly well with any non-harsh fruits you throw at it while bring a very prominent wet sweetness.  S&V test up to 8% and it's still pleasant. Above that, top notes get pretty weird.  Juicyness is pretty linear up to 6%.\n\nPersonally, this is a winner for me. Sweet, thick, and agreeable although it can easily get cloying.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Goldbones or /u/goldfish18 uses it in his \"Guavaberry.\" Talks abouts an almost bubble gum flavor.](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/4896#guavaberry_by_goldbones)\n\n[/u/philosaphucker/ has a lean recipe that uses it for the thick sweetness.](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/14992#juicy_j_s_sizzurp_by_philosaphucker)\n\n[2,143 recipes using this on ELR. Very little useful information. Some talk about Guava Nectar taste.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/5140)\n\nNot a whole lot to go on here.  Reddit search brings up a lot of non-descript \"sweet\" and \"good,\" although I have to give /u/Botboy141/ credit for getting \"grassy\" lodged in my head.  Looks like a very popular, and poorly documented flavor.  Major agreement that it's sweeter than actual guava. And that FA Guava is a weird peel-centric nightmare.  The bubble-gum mention in /u/goldfish18/ 's juice description is interesting.  I have a juice that uses it at 5% and once someone pointed it out, that's all I can taste.  I think it's safe to say the consensus is that it's sweet, non-realistic, thick, and mixes well.  Those qualities really do convey a guava nectar.\n\nBonus:\n\n[10/10 rating and vintage use of McCormicks!](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/21ufod/capellas_guava_is_totally_amazing/)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** CAP Sweet Mango @ 4%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 18 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  So, seriously check the second opinions here.  Sweet, perfumey inhale. Really heavy overripe mango on the exhale.  Overripe to the point where I'm almost getting a diacetyl style movie-theater butter note. Light perfumey note sits over the top of the rest of the flavor through the exhale. Thick and sweet.  I'd hesitate to call it creamy.  It's more just dense almost chewy.  Lingering perfume note.\nLight Peel notes, especially on the beginning of the exhale. \n\n**Off-flavors:**  This is super overripe at 4%. I'm definitely getting a buttery flavor.\n\n**Throat Hit:** 3/10.  Those perfumey notes can get a bit harsh solo.  Also a tiny bit of chest tightness that builds with prolonged use.\n\n**Uses:** Lower percentages to flesh out mango and other tropical fruits. Maybe a bit too fleshy for something like mango nectar. Buttery notes might pair well with creams, again at a lower percentage to avoid some of those overripe notes.\n\n**Pairings:** FLV Mango, FA Mango, TFA Mango. Astringent pineapple like TFA.  Dryer bright fruits. Creams and custards.\n\n**Notes:**  So, percentage is key here.  I'd keep this under 2% and avoid this as a main flavor.  This gets super weird super fast.  S&V tested from .05 to 6%. The sweetness is hard to manage, along with that overripe flavor.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nThis one is pretty well documented, and I'm much more negative on it than everyone else.

Depending on the atomizer/setup it can be either a more candy flavour or a fruity/juicy one.\n\nOn Wotofo Profile RDA it felt tangy, sweet (5/10), slightly acidic (4/10) and slightly juicy (5/10). Flavour during inhale and exhale. Very nice and rounded. Probably on the soft side - at 6% and it can take more even. Almost no harshness at all.\n\nOn Guardian (as expected) the flavour is less intense but still present nevertheless. Slightly more tangy, with fresh, slightly bitter citrus notes here, less sweetness and less juicy-ness. More of a zest and less than the flesh/juice part of the fruit.\n\n**Off-flavors:** None that I could spot.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Pretty low at this percentage (3/10).\n\n**Uses:** It is nice standalone for a break from complex flavours and in order to clean the taste buds but I can't imagine vaping this all day. It is probably a very good part of a more rounded recipe including some ingredients with which it will contrast and blend nicely.\n\n**Pairings:** Of course it would pair nice with creams, bakery and other citrus fruits. Could be interesting with a tobacco and maybe with some booze (rum, whiskey, bourbon). Also it would be interesting with some floral notes. Given this is on the sweet side I believe it would not be good to pair it with something also sweet (strawberries, melon, etc) unless you have a sweet tooth...\n\n**Notes:** I have come to really like citrus notes. So far everything I have tried with citrus I love it or can imagine pairing it with something else.\n\n**Rating:** 4.5/5 stars",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** CAP Vanilla Bean Ice Cream@ %3, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 20 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Kid's birthday party quality vanilla ice cream. Not blindingly sweet, but missing some of the heft you get from TFA VBIC.  Faint chemical vanilla edge throughout.  Seems workable but not amazing.\n\nInhale is mostly vanilla. Starts out okay but gets a bit of a sharp chemical edge to it that builds. Moderately dense, without overwhelming sweetness. Exhale is a lot denser, with a softer vanilla base and some deeper creamyness underneath. Sweeter than a straight cream and with quite a bit more body. Some buttery notes but very little in the way of an eggier frozen custard type of mix.  Vanilla top notes, not particulary floral or authentic tasting.  No real boozy, earthy vanilla bean, more of a homogenous artificial vanilla.  Lingering slightly astringent aftertaste from that vanilla note along with a hint of a pleasant malt.\n \n**Off-flavors:**  The vanilla here has a faint chemical edge to it.  Something like the vanilla note you get from cheaper off-brand ice creams. Not a huge deal, but noticeable if you're looking for it.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Light, both from a smidge of dryness and the chemical edge on that vanilla.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Does TFA Vanilla Bean Ice Cream taste peppery to you? If this answer is yes, then say hello to the CAP Version.  It's definitely the closest thing to a direct substitute without that black pepper note. I've sort of been turning into a black pepper taster with TFA VBIC, and I get none of that with the CAP version. Works well enough as a 1:1 sub, but I find that this is a bit less creamy and dense than the TFA Version. Personally, I think the best sub is  1:1 with TFA VBIC to CAP VBIC, and then adding in some additional TFA Vanilla Swirl at something like a 3:1 VBIC to Swirl ratio.  It'll still be a little less rich and heavy with a softer vanilla note, but it should at least a similar volume in recipes.  If you want some of that richness back, CAP Vanilla Custard v1 (diketones, natch) can help, but it tends to increase your steep time quite a bit.\n\nEven if you don't get black pepper from the TFA Version, I've found that CAP is substantially more accommodating for shorter steeps.\n\nIn terms of using this in a mix, go nuts. VBIC is definitely a staple flavor at this point and has been combined with damn near everything. I don't like the way it plays with floral fruits and it's too sweet for a lot of tobaccos, but other than that it's hard to find somewhere truly objectionable to put this.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nS&V Concentration testing, this seems weak at 1%. 2% tastes thin and kind of off, more like an ice milk than ice cream. 3% brings in a bit of the richness you'd expect, although that chemical edge to the vanilla seems to be scaling up pretty evenly. 4% is getting richer, but seems to be pushing away from a moister cream, and towards picking up a little dryness. 5% is personally about as high as I'd go, as that chemical edge to the vanilla is getting a little overwhelming. I'd recommend starting with this at 2% to get an ice cream edge to a creamier base. It gives you most of the flavor you want, while relying on other, more nuetral, creams for the body of your ice cream.  If you're using this as your sole ice cream component, I'd start at 4% and stick to lusher fruits to not exacerbate some of of the drier mouthfeel here.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nThis is already well documented, I just wanted to get a flavor review up for it.\n\n[TFA v.

If you’re looking for actual cake/cupcake flavor I’d go with JF yellow cake or CAP Vanilla Cupcake v1, or CAP Yellow Cake but I prefer Jungle Flavors version. \n\n**Second Opinions**\nSomeone on ELR mentions [plastic taste above 6%](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/22622) there are some other notes there with mixed reviews.\n\nOne review [on BCF](http://www.bullcityflavors.com/vanilla-cupcake-v2-cap/) that was positive and mentioned some kind of pepper taste that this and V1 shared\n\t\n5 reviews on [this site](http://vapable.com/product/new-vanilla-cupcake-v2-capella-flavour-concentrate/), one 3 star review says “Didn’t like it. Ended up down the sink. Others seem to like it, so went middle vote” .. the rest are very positive. \n",

Borders on a really fluffy butter.  If you've ever whipped cream, then tasted and realized you'd undersweetened AND ran the mixer a bit too long, that's the vibe I'm talking about.\n\nSmooth, fluffy moderately dense sweet cream on the inhale.  Cream is fairly realistic. Has some heavy dairy / buttery notes. Not frosting sweet, sweetness is delicate and subtle.  Exhale has some really faint, cheap vanilla extract notes, especially in the beginning.  Volume really shows up midway through the exhale.  Sweetness remains pretty tame. I get most of the dairy notes on the inhale and they linger through the exhale.  Finish is a bit flat and sour.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Solo, it has a slightly sour soapy finish. I've never noticed it in a mix. \n\n**Throat Hit:** 0/10.\n\n**Uses:**  Creamy emulsification.  Less rich sub for custards. Extra volume in Ice Creams or Custards. \n\n**Pairings:** Knock yourself out.  This is a blank slate. Maybe nothing that tastes too green or grassy.  That would taste pretty weird.\n\n**Notes:**\nS&V testing, this shows up pretty clearly at 1% and gets a bit too cream heavy and a touch sour after 5%.  Personally, I'd use this around 2-4% to smooth out and add creamy volume to a recipe without any other creams.  I'm not really a layerer when it comes to my juice, but I've found this doesn't stick to one layer in a recipe. It's more like a creamy emulsifier.  Not as thick or buttery as a custard, but has that same almost sticky creaminess.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Some quick, positive takes on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/3nd3j8/new_capella_vanilla_whipped_cream_anyone_tried_it/)\n\n[5 Stars, bruh.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** CAP Waffle @ 4%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 21 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** It's not a great all-in-one waffle at 4%.  The waffle itself is a bit weak and flat.  What is there tastes a whole lot like your eggo-calibre frozen waffle.  It's not a complex bakery taste, more just the odor of pale yellow eggos.  Maple note is there, it's a pretty good recreation of artificial maple syrup with a bunch of melted butter in there. Maple isn't particulary sharp and the butter doesn't taste especially rich.\n\nInhale is thin, with an almost acrid maple note. A little sweetness and buttery richness shows up towards the end of the inhale.  Eggo perfume on the beginning of the exhale. Maple is a lot more rounded and noticeably buttery here. Maple gets a bit bitter again as it lingers on the exhale.  Thinner taste overall than you'd think. Moderately sweet, especially that maple note.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Maple gets a bit weird, especially on the inhale.  I'm going to stick with acrid.  Slightly plastic-y until it gets fuller and evens out on the exhale. Sour note.  Seems to be a running thing with me and savory capella flavors but I just find them to a bit sour solo.  Not sure if anyone else picks up on this or it's a quirk of my taste buds or setup.\n\n**Throat Hit:** 2/10.  Just a bit harsh, but no one component stands out as being the harsh one.\n\n**Uses:**  Maybe a single flavor or the waffle base for a fruit.  Could be used to add richness to a dryer waffle or pancake flavor.\n\n**Pairings:**  Just spitballing here, but I'm guessing it would work well with strawberries and blueberries.  Something like CAP Vanilla Whipped Cream for the buttery smoothness.  Maybe some chocolate or banana.  VBIC or something similar would work as well.\n\n**Notes:**  This one is hard for me to recommend.  I think at low percentages (2-3%), the flavor is really muddy.  There is way too much going on to really be used as much but an rich accent for a very similar flavor that's a bit dry.  As you increase the percentage, up to about 8%, the concentrate gets overwhelming sweet and the maple gets sticky and cloying.  The actual waffle base stays pretty subtle.  As a side note, this really needs time to come together.  Flavor is a mess as a S&V.\n\nJust from doing the prerequisite googling, it seems like TFA Belgian Waffle or INW Waffle is going to be a better option for most waffle applications.  If you just want to throw this at a bunch of bright berries and cream, then you could probably do worse than this flavor though.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[/u/onionscanbesweet/ is into it, in the comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/2vglnj/can_you_guys_offer_some_help_on_a_waffle_flavor/)\n\n[A couple of good notes on the ELR Page](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/1223)\n\nFair amount of older talk about the flavor on the ECF Forums [here](https://www.e-cigarette-forum.com/forum/threads/waffle-flavoring-questions-and-opinions-please-help.325398/), and [here](https://www.e-cigarette-forum.com/forum/threads/waffle-flavoring-questions-and-opinions-please-help.325398/).

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** CAP SilverLine Whipped Marshmallow, 2 and 5%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 9 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Decent mouthfeel and a very light cereal marshmallow kind of flavor in here.  Unless I'm missing something huge, this is an extremely soft flavor.\n\nThe marshmallow I can taste is extremely faint.  I'm getting a light dry cereal marshmallow sweetness on the inhale, and just not much at all on the exhale.  There's a vanilla here, and from what I can taste of it's a bright frosting type of vanilla, but it's again really light.\n\nThere is some kind of mouthfeel here, again nothing too intense. I'm picking it up mostly as a slight thickness to the mouthfeel. It's also maybe a bit dry.  It's like a less intense version of the mouthfeel from a very low percentage of FA Meringue.  Mouthfeel seems to top out relatively quickly, it doesn't get markedly more thick as you increase the percentage.\n\nThere's a light sweetness here, along with a subtle, almost fruity tart notes in the background. I'm guessing they are only showing up because there is so little going on with this flavor in terms of an actual marshmallow taste.\n\nOf the marshmallow I can taste, seems closer to FA or FLV Marshamllow with that drier, cereal marshmallow kind of vibe. Noticeably softer and less concentrated than either.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Does the lack of flavor count as an off-flavor? I'm just not getting much actual flavor out of this.  There's also a little bit of tartness that doesn't quite seem to fit.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  There isn't much here to not be smooth.\n\n**Percentage testing:**At 2% I get a light mouthfeel, a bare hint of vanilla, and nothing else expect a little bit of a tart tanginess.  This doesn't taste like much.\n\nAt 5%, this is still lighter. I do get some cereal marshmallow on the inhale but it's weak and the exhale is almost completely flat.  Some increased density to the mouthfeel but it's not drastic.\n\nTesting this at higher percentages, I'm still not getting much here.  This at 8%, 10%, and even 15% doesn't really have a full marshmallow flavor.  I cranked it all up all the way to 25%, and was still struggling.  There is either something massive I'm missing here, or this is comically weak.  Checking out some other juices, it's not olfactory fatigue in general.  There just isn't much here, for me at least.\n\nOne of three things is true: (1)I got a bad batch, (2)There is something I physically can't taste going on here, or (3) this is incredibly weak.  Based on the other concentrates in this line and the idea that chef's generally doesn't mess these things up, I'm inclined to say it's the third option, but if you have a different experience please share.\n\nJust based on these tests, I'd probably be using this at around 8%.  I didn't notice any benefit from going higher with this.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**I'm not sure there is a compelling reason to use this over other marshmallow flavors.  It doesn't have much in the way of flavor and the sweetness or mouthfeel really isn't anything to write home about.  If you are going to use it, use in the places you'd normally use a marshmallow and crank up the percentage?\n\n**Second Opinions:**  Still fairly new.\n\n[Shoutout to ceedee99uk for linking reviews from PeegoreVapes in another thread.](https://peegorevapes.wordpress.com/2017/10/04/capella-silver-line-affordable-flavours/)  He's saying this is overbearing at 5%.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Chef's Choice Devon Cream, 3 and 6%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 8 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Take the thick mouthfeel of TPA Vanilla Swirl, some of the darker caramel notes from TPA Bavarian Cream (without that maple thing it can pick up), and some of the buttery richness of a custard.  A cream for (most) seasons, basically.\n\nThe texture here is heavier and thick.  It's almost chewy at higher percentages.  Seems to have a lot in common with TPA Vanilla Swirl just in terms of the density and mouthfeel.  It's cool to find something as chewy as Vanilla Swirl that actually has some richness and nuance to it.\n\nI'm not getting a real heavy \"milky\" type of cream out of this.  There doesn't seem to be much in the way of that kind of cheesy dairy note.\n\nOverall this pretty heavily sweet. It has some medium-dark kind of caramel to it like tpa bavarian cream, but it doesn't cross into that kind of maple accent.  I do get quite a bit of vanilla out this.  I think the vanilla here is a brighter, almost frosting type vanilla, but that caramel sweetness makes it seem less one dimensional and a bit more complex.\n\nI get some butter out of this, and FWIW it's dark enough that I want to say I should probably be tasting more.  I don't pick up that kind of heavy egginess that I'd really expect from a custard, but I do pick up some pretty authentic tasting buttery rich notes.  Tastes about as buttery to me as CAP VC1, but without the eggyness.  I'd say INW Custard tastes a bit richer to me, but looking at the second opinions I might just not be picking up something that other people are.\n\nAgain, the noncontroversial consensus here is that this is rebottled cupcake world, but I picked it up from Chefs Flavours as part of their Chef's Choice line.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Devon cream is supposed to be about half butterfat, and this doesn't taste quite that rich to me, but I'm admittedly pretty limited with custards.  The second opinions talk about heavier custard notes but I don't really get eggy out of this and I'm not getting an overwhelming richness.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Nah, not really.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 3% I'm getting pretty good texture, but not a lot of flavor.  I feel like I can taste some of the VG underneath this.  Some brighter vanilla and medium caramel top notes here, but I'm not getting too much in way of richness.\n\nAt 6% this is quite a bit richer. I'm getting some buttery notes here, and that base has filled in substantially. Vanilla is sticking out a lot less and blending better with that caramel note.\n\nChef's suggested usage of this is between 10-20% and that seems like maybe a bit of overkill.  Just based on these tests I'd probably be using this as a primary note up to about 8%, a creamy background around 6%, and a cream booster around 4%.  Just looking at the second opinions, you may run into some muting, but that kind of seems like a fit for the profile if you have a heavily creamy recipe.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I'd guess there aren't a ton of cream applications that this wouldn't fit into.  It doesn't have the eggyness of a custard for me, or any real heavy dairy notes in here so it should be relatively neutral most of the places where you'd want to stick a cream without making every taste too milky or eggy.\n\nProbably includes all the normal fruit and cream nonsense.\n\nI'd say this doesn't quite have the fattiness of FW Sweet Cream or CAP Vanilla Whipped Cream, so I'd probably skip the whipped cream type of applications.\n\nToo flat of a texture for just a richness enhancer like CAP VC! or INW Custard.\n\nProbably not a primary cream note if you actually want something like milk for a cereal.  More of a cream booster in that application.\n\nI could see this working really well to boost the volume in ice creams and custards.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  [Here's the ELR Page for Cupcake World Devon Cream.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/36544)  User \"cca\" writes: \"Use at the same % as TPA Bav Cream. More depth and butter than Bav Cream. Use at 1-3%.\"  I think it's a bit weaker than that, but I haven't worked with extensively, so I could very well be wrong here.  Another note from \"TwoTone\" who writes: \"This is the Most amazing Cream i have tasted so far...dont use high % in a mix.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Chef's Choice Waffle, 3 and 6%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 6 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  A drier waffle flavor, bordering on a waffle cone.\n\nThe waffle here is actually surprisingly solid.  Not a bright yellow eggo type of flavor, and not straight waffle iron.  I'd peg this as a close to a middle of the road waffle.  Not intensely rich or buttery, but I do get some richer notes that kind of fill in that drier, sweeter kind of toasted meringue note from the waffle.  Medium cook on the waffle, not a batter but doesn't have any heavier, burnt notes.  Very subtle waffle iron flavor that actually blends in pretty well and complements everything instead of dominating.\n\nI don't get any real maple out of this.  There's a a darker bakery vanilla extract kind of flavor that hits some of the same bases as a maple, but I don't pick up anything that feels overwhelmingly like maple syrup here.  If it's there, it's a light enough accent that it adds to the profile without dominating.\n\nTexture here is a little dry and flat. Pulls fairly close to a waffle cone.  Doesn't seem to have that fluffier mouthfeel for a full on waffle.  A bit on the sweet side, but not out of profile for a waffle. There's a bit of a powdered sugar effect with that sweetness and dryness.\n\nThis reminds me a lot of a less \"dirty\" tasting and more full tasting version of [Solubarome Waffle.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/6krkll/solubarome_waffle/)  That's a pretty good thing.  I'd say this still leans just a bit toward a drier waffle cone flavor but I do get more richness out of this.  Not quite buttery, but less dry and almost chalky than the solubarome version for sure.  I don't get any of that slightly dirty waffle iron thing I get from the solubarome. I also get a lot less vanilla out of this as well. Shoutout to OptimusRhyme for sending me some of the now extinct INW Waffle, I can confidently say this probably isn't your INW Waffle replacement, but it's pretty decent in it's own right.\n\nJust getting further into weird brands, this is one of the Chef's Flavours rebottled brands.  This is from their \"Chef's Choice\" line, but they have a bunch of other ones.  [There seems to be a pretty noncontroversial consensus that these are rebranded cupcake world flavors.](https://ukvapers.org/Thread-Cupcake-World-concentrates?page=2)\n\n**Off-flavors:**  A little bit dry for a straight waffle.  That dryness seems to make the flavor a bit muddy with prolonged vaping.  Nothing too off here though.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light.  Mostly just the dryness solo.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 3% this doesn't feel filled in.  There's some waffle-ish top notes but I'm not getting that more solid texture.  Vanilla sticks out a little bit more without the body behind it.  There's a light fruitiness this low that feels a bit strange.\n\nAt 6% this is quite a bit better. Fuller base, if a little dry overall. Bakery vanilla seems better in balance here. Some very light richness here, I mostly feel it as a richer mouthfeel than the 3% than taste it is a distinct butter note.\n\nJust based on these tests, I'd probably use this between 5 and 8%, although this seems fairly forgiving if you did want to use a heavier hand. I'd mostly watch for the dryness.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Probably a better choice for a waffle cone than Solubarome Waffle.  Just run with the dryness here, and the waffle top notes should carry through over an ice cream base.\n\nDecent waffle to try to bulk out if you want a more traditional waffle.  A little bit of AP would probably help, along with a fluffier bakery, with maybe a bit of FLV Cream or CAP VC1 to emulsify and add some richness.  After that, bright, slightly syrupy fruits should work.\n\nUse to add a little bit more \"breakfast\" type flavor for a pancake base.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  Surprisingly thin. Can't find anything on Chef's Choice Waffle, and Cupcake World Waffle is damn near impossible to google.\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

The body isn't coming from the cream, more of the slight dryness wafer type texture of the cookie. It tastes very much like a shortbread or butter cookie, served in a bowl with a smooth vanilla pudding. I can swear I am tasting INW Biscuit in this one, or AP? I wouldn't classify this as a custard as it's missing that heavy dark vanilla, rich cream, and eggs. Which is not a bad thing at all. It's very similiar to instant vanilla pudding made with milk. With a very light back note of coconut. I'm sorry, I'm not describing this well. I think it must be past my bedtime.

Avoid melons. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Notes:** Again, I was afraid of the recommended percentages. I actually think the 20% is a good strength on this one. For my tastes the 30% would be too much. I'm going to stop beating around the bush here. This is a bite of Jello Instant Vanilla Pudding scooped up with a Mother's English Tea Cookie sprinkled with a bit of coconut. \n",

Smells exactly like their Welsh Custard (very distinctive) with a little added play doh.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Flavor Description:** First thing that hits me is, you guessed it, strong play doh. I do get a cakey note/body, and a light sugary glaze flavor. I'm getting a slight malt or chocolate flavor? Just very faint but present. The custard is very well balanced with the play doh, ahem, doughnut. The custard component does taste and smell almost exactly like their Welsh Custard, although the doughnut seems to absorb the super richness and egg aspect of the Welsh, so it's not as heavy. Nice bakery vanilla extract flavor, and overall a moist full bodied vape. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:** Malt or chocolate.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit:** 2/10\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Pairings:** This is a pretty complete flavor profile. I would say anything you would consider a good topping for a custard filled doughnut. Any fruit, especially berries or apple, maybe apple pie, chocolate, caramel, maple, white chocolate, coffee, nuts, tobaccos, spices, cinnamon.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Notes:** I am probably the wrong person to be reviewing this flavor as I'm sensitive to the doughnut flavors. If you like doughnut flavors, you will probably love this. If you usually taste play doh with doughnut flavorings, avoid this one. I apparently haven't given up on finding that perfect doughnut\nvape as I keep trying even though I say I give up :( If I broke this down, I'd say it tastes exactly like CAP Glazed Donut mixed with their Welsh Custard with a little meringue thrown in to add to the sweet glaze. This seems to have good strength at the 20%, and although it doesn't seem over flavored, I might consider trying it at 15% to see if it really needs the full 20%. I would definitely drop it to at least 10-12% if adding accent flavors.",

Just lightly sweet more like a flan, not as sweet as typical American pudding. First flavor that hits is a rich dark type vanilla. It also has a very smooth yet rich egg custard base that is balanced very well, still allowing the vanilla to stay to the front. Exhale gives me a hint of warm caramel, but a bit more of something? I almost want to say a mild and understated tobacco like a sweet RY4 maybe. Overall a very complex flavor that tastes like it's intended to be a One-Shot. And pulls it off well.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:** Tobacco\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit:** 3/10\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Pairings:** Avoid citrus and heavy fruits. It's already so dense and rich that dark fruits will weigh it down. Coffee, cookies, cakes, cereal, creams, custards, nuts, tobaccos, spices, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Notes:** I was a little afraid of this one because of the recommended 20% usage. However, I was pleasantly surprised by the flavor level. It doesn't seem over flavored and is very good. But it's not an ADV for me due to the richness. I can see myself enjoying this for a couple hours though, especially with coffee. However, the smell when vaping is A M A Z I N G! I honestly think this will be much more vapeable in the 10% range and seems to be strong enough to hold up. It will require further testing, but if lowering the percentage helps reduce the richness while still allowing full flavor I can see myself using this more often. Otherwise, it will be a delicious rich custard dessert with my after dinner coffee. In mixes I'm going to try 1-3%.\n\n**EDIT:** I had a typo in the name in the title.

ChemNic recommends 10-15% of this flavor as a standalone so I started with 10%. It can stand on its own at 10% but it is very simple yet still enjoyable as a single flavor. First thing I set off to do with it was subbing it for FW Yellow Cake in my old favorite Bronuts (props to /u/enyawreklaw). The short of it is that this flavor works as a FW Yellow Cake replacement. Comparing original Bronuts to the subbed version I seem to be noticing less of the “waxy” chocolate taste. That you /u/chrisdvr1 for the formatting I borrowed from. I am a complete n00b for flavor notes as you may have noticed from some of my other posts but got to start somewhere I suppose.\n\n**Rating** 95/100\n\nClose enough to replace FW Yellow Cake\n\nhttps://www.chemnic.com/DIY-E-liquid-Flavoring/ChemNic%20Flavoring/Yellow-Cake-Flavoring",

A steep does help and I recommend 4-6 days to let it come together. Its rich, creamy and very full, it really coats the tongue, The Vanilla isn't dark or overtly bright, but works well with a lot of things because of that. Wouldn't say that it has any butter of any kind\n\nOff-notes: When I crank this up past 5% it gets lost and has slight almost wax notes, imagine you bit into those soft wax bottle candies from when you were a kid, you don't taste it but the mouthfeel is there, its kinda off-putting \n\nThroat Hit: Not at all, very smooth. 2/10 if that.\n\nPairings: Man this stuff can go with a lot, pairs well with other vanillas, custards, puddings, and really goes well with fruits. This is like a base note for me and a really good one at that, i find that a little bit of WF Vanilla Cream Extra really supports it and INW Custard goes with it as well, This is a pretty fun flavor imo.\n\nSecond opinion from the legless wheel augmented u/wolfwheeler is \"It’s better than FLV. It’s sweet, bright vanilla, and really has that snack pack flavor that everyone wants from a pudding.\"\nWould recommend it in a mix at 1.5-3%",

Alas! All my fears were for naught! This is a rather mild, sweet and tasty black licorice flavor! I was surprised to learn that licorice and anise are actually unrelated plants, because I had always associated black licorice with \"anise\" flavor. I was expecting this to have a strong Jagermeister/Absinthe type flavor, but it does not! It is rather smooth, sweet (but not overly sweet), and quite mild, this would probably be pushed deep into the background by stronger flavors.\n\n**Off-flavors:** none\n\n**Throat Hit:** none\n\n**Uses & Pairings:** This is where it gets interesting: apparently licorice is most commonly used as a tobacco flavoring. This concentrate would pair very well with any tobacco (especially pipe tobacco) to sweeten and add depth and complexity at between 2-3%. You could also use this in place of anise in recipes that need this kind of flavor but only a touch (1-2%) paired with vanilla, anise, mint, or menthol this could be a satisfying simple candy mix.\n\n**Notes:** i got this in the ATF awesome box by request. most people who got the box didn't get this. how sad... i wouldnt be surprised if this could be used solo at a higher percentage. in my search for second opinions i saw someone recommend Delosi be used at 5-12%. i wouldn't go that high but i could see 5-6% solo.\n\n**Second Opinions:** [Christy says \"I love this for a kicking vape and it tastes quite like licorice jelly beans to me.\"](http://www.delosi.com/flavoring/candies/black-licorice.html)",

It waters the flavors down slightly and adds a super subtle, wonderful coolness. It works great as an accent to drink or cocktail recipes. One thing to note is that in using other coolants, it is much less potent -- you'll want to use it around 1-2% to get the effect you're looking for instead of 0.25%-1% (for those that go higher than 1% with TFA Koolada or something similar you will not be impressed with the level of cooling on this flavoring). This flavoring works really well with heavy/forward flavors or syrupy flavors since it does seem to subdue flavors a bit with diluted watery-ness. Where I get off flavors from things like TFA Koolada, I really get no flavor at all from this one. The best way to describe it is if you dropped some ice or ice-water in your recipe. \n\n**On the Nose**  \nNothing \n\n**Recommended Usage**  \n*Stand alone*: 3-5%\n\n*In a mix*: 1-2%\n\n**Throat**  \nNone\n\n**Ideal Pairings**  \nCocktails, sodas, beverages\n\n**Steep**  \n1-3 Days\n\n**Recipe Inclusion: [Wolf Cola](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/58269#wolf_cola_by_cheebasteeba)**  \n*Ratio: 30PG/70VG*  \n*Steep: S&V* \n\n**Ingredient**|**%**|\n:--|:--|\nDF Ice -- Original|1.5%|\nFA Cola (USA Pleasure)|4%|\nFLV Rich Cinnamon|0.125%|\nINW Marzipan|1%|\n\nThis recipe tastes like a liter a' cola you got at the drive through that's been sitting for about 20 mins; right as it's super refreshing, slightly effeversecnt still, and diluted with much needed water (ice).

Somewhat moist and dense with a light vanilla finish. Captures some of the icing feel but this is mostly a very nice cake. Reminds me of a cake right from the box like betty crocker with the matching betty crocker icing. Sweet, not too sweet and its got that artificial vanilla vibe with just the lightest touch of butter. \n\n**Off-flavors**:  Nothing. \n\n**Throat Hit**:  minimal to none\n\n**Uses**:  Not as concentrated as JF yellow cake, I just got CAP yellow cake in and will be reviewing that soon. I think you could use this as a 1:1 sub for FW yellow cake, I used this for Mansons Strawberry Shortcake bar and it turned out great. Anywhere you would use a yellow cake flavor as an accent or a base note. This is a very nice standalone cake flavor.\n\n**Pairings**:  Creams, custards, fruits, chocolates, butter, butterscotch, other cakes and bakery stuff, nuts, caramel (+RY4), cinnamon and other spices, spirits might work to make rum cakes and things like that. This would do well to moisten some dryer ingredients like FA cookie or INW biscuit or things like FA hazelnut. \n\n**Notes** haven’t tried it yet but I think this would be even better as a standalone around 6 or 7%. This is a really great flavoring and so far I prefer it to JF yellow cake on its own.

Reminds me of the same cocoa taste that is in their nutella flavor. It’s a decent chocolate taste, not really like an oreo reminds me more of a chips ahoy chocolate chip.

I think this could somehow work for a chocolate chip cookie recipe. Its just a weak flavoring and its quite dark so anything over 5% will result in a considerably brown final product. I think paired with some other stronger chocolate (HS Australian chocolate) and maybe more cookie flavor, this could make a nice crumble for ice cream cake ( which Is what I first thought of when I saw this flavor).

    "markdown": "Sometime in July, DIY Flavor Shack decided to reformulate some of their flavors. One of those affected was the beloved Holy Holy Grail RY4. I picked up a bottle of the v1 right before it sailed off into the sunset and got some of the v2 a month ago. What follows is an attempt to compare and contrast these concentrates in order to better assist you in your purchasing decisions.\n\nThanks to the original [HHGRY4 review](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/5rxh3x/diyfs_holy_holy_grail_ry4/), which was a big part of the reason I got the flavor in the first place.\n\nThere are a number of fantastic recipes that use this concentrate, the most obvious being [Cardinal by fear](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/24962#cardinal_by_fear). I’d also like to give a shout out to [Raven](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/73078#raven_by_id10_t)  by /u/ID10-T as I consider it the most innovative of the Cardinal derivatives I have seen.\n\n\n**Hardware**: DNA250C @ 250°C/80W, Pixie RDA, 5 wrap 3mm ID fused clapton (3\\*30ga / 38ga) SS316L @ 0.22 Ohms, 100% cotton wick.\n\n**Mixing**: 80/20 VG/PG. Mixed at 5%, steeped for one week.\n\n### Version One\n\n**Flavor profile**: This flavor tastes sweet and savory to me all at once. I think the strongest part of the flavor is the caramel, followed by the vanilla with the tobacco a distant third. I can’t identify what type of tobacco is in here, but it’s likely a blend and mixed weakly. There is also a toasted/nutty note on the exhale. It’s not quite peanut butter, but that might be what they were going for.\n\n**Throat hit**: 2/10 - this flavor is pretty smooth, definitely not a strong throat hit, but there is a hint of harshness around the nutty flavor which is welcome considering this is likely to be used primarily in tobacco recipes.\n\n**Uses**: To me, HHGRY4 checks all of the boxes for an RY4. It’s got a little bit of sweetness, good caramel base, and some interesting (if incomplete) tobacco notes. It smooths out potential rough edges in tobaccos and can bring some depth to simpler dessert profiles.\n\n**Pairings**: I could see this going well with INW Shisha Vanilla and most of the tobaccos. Probably doesn’t mix well with tobaccos that have a unique flavor, like FLV Cavendish or INW Black for Pipe.\n\n**Off-flavors**: Almost none. Compared to TPA RY4 Double it’s very refreshing with only the slightest hint of a cloying chemical taste. I think this could be used as high as 8 or 10% if you wanted a bold RY4.\n\n### Version Two\n\n\n**Flavor profile**: There’s less caramel flavor in this one. The whole thing feels a bit weaker, but there is the same trio of caramel, vanilla, and tobacco. The caramel is much less prominent and the flavors feel a bit more balanced, which doesn’t work to its credit.\n\n**Throat hit**: 3/10 - there’s a light throat hit on the inhale, but less of the toasted note on the exhale that was causing the throat hit with the v1.\n\n**Uses**: At anything under 6% I can’t see this being much more than a complement to other, stronger flavors. You’d need to add at least a caramel and probably some vanilla to it for it to be a bold RY4.\n\n**Pairings**: Very similar to the v1 - the only thing I’d add for this one is that you will likely want to bring another caramel along for the ride.\n\n**Off-flavors**: Because this tastes a bit weaker overall compared to the v1, I also totally lose any off flavors that were present in the v1 as well. After bumping this mix up to 8% it has a similar off-taste to the v1 at 5%.\n\n### Comparison\n\nI went into this expecting the v2 to be a lot worse. It’s actually not really worse or better than the v1, however it tastes quite a bit less potent. From that perspective, it is a bit disappointing, as it means you get less mileage from each bottle. However, this test has removed my hesitation to mix any older recipes because I think the v2 is a good substitute at a slightly higher percentage.\n\nIn short, there is good news! Holy Holy Grail RY4 isn’t dead, not as far as I am concerned anyway. What it lacks in potency it makes up for in versatility - a concentrate you can use at a low or high percentage that works with a variety of different profiles and flavors. It didn’t get any better, but it didn’t get much worse. I wouldn’t rush out to get a huge supply of the new stuff because there are likely other better RY4s you can make yourself from the constituent ingredients, but we don’t have to bury all of the old recipes in a pit in the desert, either.\n\nThanks for reading, and I hope your mixing is pleasant and prosperous!\n\n**EDIT:** **[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

    "markdown": "Holy Vanilla’s biggest strength is it’s pure versatility. It’s a richer dark vanilla, and standalone in slightly higher than normal percentages it’s quite like a true Vanilla Ice Cream. No off buttery tones like the others. I’ll start with notes from 1%-4% which is my suggested range officially.\n\n1% In the additive range, what you get is something similar to FA Vanilla Classic, only a bit deeper. A touch of spice like freshly cracked vanilla beans, along with the creamier vanilla notes, but very little creaminess. This makes it a great choice to boost your vanilla in an existing recipe, or just to add a little zing to your bakeries.\n\n2% The creaminess starts to step up here, becoming somewhat milky but not dense like a heavier custard. In this range it’s able to stand up to just about anything in a mix, and will stand out against even the biggest bully flavors. That cracked bean spice flavor is still present, but it’s less a spicy note and more a deeper vanilla like a bit of vanilla extract in a glass of milk.\n\n3% My preferred standalone usage for ages. The creaminess really takes on some serious body here. The spicy notes come back from where they were at 1% and stand right out against a dark vanilla cream. Still not at all eggy or buttery like most other vanilla creams we have available. It starts picking up some very malty tones here, not at all unpleasant though some may not care for it.\n\n4% For the bold, this range really cranks up the vanilla and the creams are intense. I loved it at this percentage, but for me I end up getting olfactory fatigue very quickly so I’m unable to vape it at this percentage for very long, as I’m often incapable of tasting it after a few drippers full. The malty tones become more present here as well.\n\nHoly vanilla is a forgiving steeper, and is often ready long before it’s heavy custard counterparts. 3-7 days depending on preference and it’s counterparts in a finished recipe.\n\nMy very absolute favorite usage of Holy Vanilla is with florals. For anyone who likes floral types like I do, this vanilla is bold enough to work alongside any floral flavor and stand out without taking away from your more delicate flavors. Anyone who’s spent any time trying to balance floral flavors knows it’s an incredible challenge getting consistent results when working with pairing florals. Holy Vanilla changed the way I approach florals and other delicate flavors.\n\nIn closing: Holy Vanilla - More flexible than your favorite stripper, and it doesn't sneak the last of your money out of your pocket after you visit with it. Buy it and thank /u/tranceinate later.\n\nEdit:\n\nSecond Opinion [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/4tm07w/holy_vanilla_diy_flavor_shack/) by /u/Chrisdvr1",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** DIYFS Mr. Good Stuff @ 3%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 25 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** A really solid vanilla whipped cream with a caramel backend. Overall light on dairy but super fluffy.  A very commercial whip cream bordering on a richer kool-whip with a strong neutral vanilla flavor and a caramel sauce towards the end of the exhale.\n\nInhale is mostly a warm dense sweetness with some clean vanilla. Definite sweetener edge there. Exhale starts on a really fluffy, slightly dry vanilla. Actual vanilla flavor is pretty neutral, bordering on a bit too clean and artificial.  No real dairy there, but definitely tastes whipped and fluffy.   Soft, blonde caramel notes later in the exhale without much fatty richness. Overall effect is like a caramel sauce. Lingering caramel and sweetener bitterness. Overall fairly dense, and definitely sweet.\n\n**Off-flavors:** So, there is some kind of added sweetener in here. Or, alternatively, there isn't and i'm beyond impressed. I get a bit of aspartame-y sucralose throughout then entire vape.\n\n**Throat Hit:** None that I tell.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This is good as a stand-alone. Definitely on the sweet side, but pretty well balanced.\n\nMixing this, I'd stay away from sweeter or candy fruits unless you want an overbearing style of sweetness.  Personally, I'd use this as an opportunity to bring in some tarter flavors or maybe even some citrus.  Pineapple, Cranberry, Raspberry, Blackcurrant, or Blood Orange would all take advantage of the sweetness here without pushing into cloying.\n\nI can also see use in bakeries, especially those aimed at replicating more of a commercial juice. Use it like a amped up whip cream and you could use a grainier pastry base involving FA Cookie or INW Biscuit.\n\nShould provide an interesting counterpoint to more realistic nut flavors. I'd avoid creams or custards, just because I feel like that sweetness might be an issue. Or don't avoid them, and get ready for a stronger ice cream or milkshake base.  Some eggyness or dairy may help push this into a more realistic flavor, so something like FA Fresh Cream or INW Creme Brulee.\n\nThis will take any tobacco squarely into a fluffy RY4 territory.\n\nAlso, this makes a hell of a flavor for adding to coffee. So maybe a darker roasted espresso flavor like FA Dark Bean or even a dark chocolate flavor like HS Australian Chocolate or FA Cocoa.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nS&V concentration testing, at 1% I get a slightly bitter vanilla extract type of flavor. Not a whole lot of caramel that low. 2% wakes up that caramel a bit, and gives quite a bit more richness on the exhale.  Almost a bit of a marzipan note as the vanilla is present but not all that fluffy. 3% gives some serious body to vanilla and some additional caramel. 4% seems a bit too much, and the sweetness gets too pronounced to be pleasant and reads fairly bitter. I'd mix this at 2% and run it solo or as a strong primary favor at 3%.\n\nI got this as a free sample in my order for Holy Vanilla and decided what the hell, I'll test it out.  I'm really enjoying it as a one-shot. It's a good bordering on great flavor, I just don't see myself using it much beyond that because it's not really what I'm after in a concentrate. I'm not a fan of having the sweetness predetermined for me here, although it is damn tasty as presented.  Little bit of sticker shock at $10 an ounce, but Flavorah is actually above that price point on even their cheap concentrates and plenty of INW goes for $4.49 for 10ml. The price could be an issue, although this works perfectly fine as a one-shot at 3% so the value is definitely there.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nNot a whole lot I can find.\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

This is a flavour that should be in every cake lovers arsenal! \n\n**Setup**\n\nRDA | Hastur RDA 2S by Cthulhu Mod | Dual 6 wrap triple-twisted SS coils | 0.25 Ω | 40 watts | Japanese organic cotton   \n\n**Testing** \n\nSteep Time: None / 1 week | Used: 2% | 70/30 VG/PG | Nic: 0% \n\n**Throat Hit**\n\nNone; 0/10\n\n**Smell** \n\nThis is one of the best smelling bakery flavourings I have ever smelled. On first whiff, I get a very sweet vanilla, which smells simply divine! It smells like icing on a cake. On second whiff, I get what sugar, butter, and egg yolks mixed together smells like. No yeast or baked notes. Trying to describe the smell made me realize that I am smelling cake batter. Unbaked sweet deliciousness!\n\n**Flavour Description**\n\nSomething that smells this great must also taste great, right? At least that’s what I was hoping for and guess what, it does! Rich, sweet, cakey, and full of flavour. It tastes just like a fluffy moist vanilla cake with frosting. I want to pour this flavouring into a cake pan and bake it, that’s how good it is. It is everything that I want in a cake flavouring. The vanilla they use is unreal and is similar to Holy Vanilla but different. Overall this is my flavourite cake flavouring to date. Although, this may just be me, but I feel it leans slightly towards cake batter than baked cake. A darker caramelic note may help with the baked note or even a drop or two of Acetyl Pyrazine. At 2% this flavour is very strong and I would even suggest 1.5% as a standalone. \n\n**Off Flavours**\n\nNon-what so ever. Very clean and very accurate yellow cake. \n\n**Uses**\n\nAny recipe that you want a sweet, moist, fluffy, vanilla cake. Very strong flavour, so I suggest starting off low, 0.5% in a mix, and work your way up to 1.5%. I enjoy this flavour as a standalone but have mixed it with common bakery flavourings and it does blend nicely. \n\n**Notes** \n\nInitially I did a taste test sample before shake and vaping… and I went back for a second… and a third. This stuff is heavenly! I did eventually get around to vaping it and it boy oh boy was full of flavour, even when fresh! I don’t think this flavour needs a long steep, it is good right away but best after 3-7 days.\n\n**Rating**\n\nA+ for its potency, accuracy and overall deliciousness!\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Recipes** \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Vanilla Custard**\n\nMFG | Flavour | %\n:--|:--:|--:\nCAP | Vanilla Custard | 10\nDIYFS | Pound Cake | 0.5\nDIYFS | Holy Vanilla | 1.5\nCAP | Sugar Cookie | 2.5\n\n*Steep Time:* 4-6 weeks but if you like fresh custards this one is great after a week and only gets better.\n\nThis is slowly becoming my favourite vanilla custard. The presence of the sweet, rich, and moist pound cake really compliments the custard. The profile is a rich vanilla custard layered on cake. The sugar cookie helps boost the baked note but ever so slightly, while holy vanilla adds more depth to the vanilla profile.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Peach Cake**\n\nMFG | Flavour | %\n:--|:--:|--:\nINW | Peach | 1.5\nFA | White Peach | 1\nDIYFS | Pound Cake | 1.5\nTPA| Strawberry Ripe | 3\n\n*Steep Time:* 1+ week\n\nBoth peaches combine to create a sweet peach profile layered on a moist vanilla cake. The strawberry ripe adds sweetness and because I can't taste strawberries it does not change the peach profile but merely pushes the peach forward. Simple but delicious. \n",

Just a touch of butter and maple. Brown sugar is the most prominent flavor and I think that’s why this stuff is super brown in color. Not overly sweet at 3% but any more and your juice will be chocolaty brown. Overall sweeter and more dense than TPA brown sugar extra.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  None really, was expecting more of a white sugar cream but I am pleasantly surprised.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Lil somethin somethin (4/10)\n\n**Uses:**  This is definitely something I would use as a final touch to a recipe that calls for sweet brown sugar. I think of pancakes, baked goods and custards. Really rich flavor, this would shine in a lot of recipes at 1-3%, I hope people pick this up because I will be using it and hopefully releasing a couple recipes. I have been chasing a great pancake/waffle vape for a while; I think this would compliment maple well. Also this would be great for any kind of cookie.\n\n**Pairings:**  Some fruits like apple, pineapple, strawberries, plums, apricot, banana, stuff like that. Custards and creams for days. Vanilla, caramel, butterscotch, nuts, coffee. Would work to add buttery notes and creaminess as well as brown sugar to just about anything. Bakery stuff is the obvious pairing here. \n\n**Notes:** This stuff is tasty standalone, its not too sweet even though from smelling it I thought there was sugar in the bottle. The buttery notes make this something I could vape by itself and I am enjoying finishing the tester bottle. \n\nDefinitely think I could have steeped this longer and I would bet it just gets better.\n\nAt 1% getting brown sugar and some butter, not as dense feeling as it is at 3% but still there.\n\n**Second Opinions**\n\nNot much out there but a funny 4 star review on DIYFS website [tastes amazing at 30%, anything less than that is just barely an additive!]( https://www.diyflavorshack.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=Sugar+Cream+DIY+Flavoring)\n\nThat review is from 2013 and the two previous are from 2011. \n\n*I think this is interesting and worth picking up a 3.7ml to try out, I bought a sample pack along with a 60ml of holy vanilla. Will be reviewing their nutella, pomegranate, chocolate cookie rounds, angel food cake,  maniacal melon (apple/watermelon) and the holy grail ry4 after it steeps. Not sure if I will review holy vanilla, but that shit is bomb and whatever reviews are out there are spot on. I am doing these reviews because I am sure that Holy Vanilla can’t be their one hit wonder. I don’t think sugar cream is the next big thing though: if Holy Vanilla is an A+, this one I would give about a B maybe B+ if used right.*\n",

    "markdown": "*Disclaimer: This flavor was given to me for free, for the purpose of this review.*\n\n**Hardware:** N80 Clapton Wire, 2.5mm, 0.45 resistance, Asmodus C4, 55W\n\n**Mixing**: 1-5% 70/30 VG-PG. 1 week steep.\n\n**Flavor profile:** A floral juicy black cherry.\n\n**Throat hit**: Medium. I get some itching and scratching and a tad pressure on the chest too.\n\n**Uses and pairings**: Fruits, fruits and lots of fruits and tobacco! That is exactly what I can see this being used for. Don't bother adding this to bakeries or deserts really. Possibly creams, but not as a main note at least. For an accent, you kinda wanna push this to around 2% and this is where the juiciness start's to appear. I have pushed it all the way to 5%, which I find to be just fine as a stand-alone. Although I can't really see this being used as a main note nor as a stand-alone. It's a little too floral to be used as a main note, which the juciness and deep black cherry notes can't overcome. With that said, it is one of the better cherries that I have tried, as it does have a more natural cherry flavor and not much candy going on.\n\n**Off-flavors**: Sadly, like many other cherries, this one has issues. In the range of 2-3% I pick up a heavy note of perfume, which are common in many cherry flavors. It does have a nice juciness and a deep note of black ripe cherry, but that perfume kinda destroy the joy. At the exhale, I sadly get hit by a wave of the perfume, which puts a bad end to your vaping circle (sorry, lack of better explanation).\n\n**Notes**: Let's adress the elephant in the room here. Besides the perfume, this flavor has one HUGE issue. It's not based in the taste itself, but this is an issue that will make the more experienced mixers stay away from using this. This flavor has red food dye in it. It's common in this community amongst the experienced mixers, that food dye has no place in mixing, as you do not want to add something that is just not supposed to be there. It's all about control, and once something like food dye is forced upon you, then you're at the point where as an experienced mixer you probably won't use it. If you don't care, then it's fine and dandy (besides the rush of perfume).\n\nFinally, which I forgort to mention in my previous reviews; their concentrates come in a minimum at 30ml, which again is not ideal. If they offered at least 10ml, so we as mixers has a chance to test their flavors, then I think they'd have a much better chance at competing with the other brands out there.\n\n[**DIY\\_eJuice Flavor Reviews**](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)",

    "markdown": "*DuraSmoke sent me this flavor for review.*\n\n**Setup:** Wasp Nano. 6 wrap SS Clapton coil with cotton wick. 32 watts. 60VG/40PG. Flavor @ 2, 4, and 6%.\n\n**Notes:** I didn't have the highest expectations for this flavor. I'm finicky when it comes to blackberry concentrates, and I've never had a champagne flavor that's impressed me. This flavor, while maybe not 100% accurate, turned out to be more impressive than I had anticipated, though. The blackberry and champagne are evenly blended; you taste an actual blackberry champagne, not a separate blackberry *and* champagne.\n\nThe champagne taste is really strong and noticeable right off of the shake, and it loses some of its edge with a steep. It has the authentic champagne dryness, but it seems like it can get a little heavy at higher percentages. At 4%, there's a boozy note that comes out of the shadows. This, coupled, with the heaviness, makes the flavor seem like more of a wine than a champagne. If you're looking for any sort of effervescence, you won't find it here. I don't view that as a negative, seeing as how almost all flavors that claim to be able to mimic the feeling of carbonation fall short as well. \n\nThe blackberry here reminds me of FW Blackberry. It's borderline artificial, lighter, and candy-like. I didn't pick up on any of the floral components that are strong in other blackberry concentrates (namely TFA). At higher percentages, the blackberry slightly muscles out the champagne, but not too aggressively; it just stays more noticeable than I would have expected. The berry provides a small amount of sweetness, but at higher percentages, the champagne flavor overpowers it. I wouldn't call the flavor bitter, but it's not incredibly sweet either.\n\n**Mouthfeel:** There isn't anything that't too remarkable about the mouthfeel. The flavor is maybe a bit thick for a champagne, but it's not a significantly dense flavor. On a scale of 1-10 with 10 being the heaviest, I'd put this at about 4 1/2. It's kinda sticky feeling at lower percentages, but not in a way that takes away from the flavor's authenticity.\n\n**Off-notes:** When vaping on this for longer periods of time, there's somewhat of an astringency that clings to the roof of your mouth. For what it's worth, I couldn't pick up on this as much at lower percentages, but if you're sensitive to chemical notes, you may find this off-putting. Also, I'm not sure that I would consider this an off-note, but the blackberry takes on a grape-like quality when you bump up the flavor percentage. It doesn't completely morph into a grape, but it makes the flavor seem more like wine than champagne. \n\n**Suggested percentages and pairings:** 2% would be fairly suitable if you were to use this as an accent. I personally wouldn't go higher than 4% if using this with other flavors, but 5-6% seems like the ideal solo range. It's a beverage, and it's going to work best in that profile. It'll be compatible with other berries, and it shouldn't clash too much with citrus flavors. The biggest limiting factor is going to be the blackberry note. If a flavor clashes with that, you're going to have a hard time going far with this.",

Not much info are found on their website for the individual flavors. Although, they do state that their flavors are very concentrated.\n\n**Throat hit**: Low to medium throat hit here. I get a nice amount of \"itching\" in my throat, which is very pleasent.\n\n**Uses and pairings**: I actually find this concentrate perfect for a yogurt or in desserts where you needed a yogurt note. The blueberry in this yogurt will be the main base, but I can easily see it being mixed with other sweet fruits as well. Peach, mango, strawberry, raspberry and so forth comes to mind. I would maybe avoid citrus fruits here, but (and there is a but) and I can see it work very well with a sweeter citrus - like a sweet lemon! Should work perfectly fine for bakeries and custards as well, thanks to the very forward yogurt flavor, that adds a very good and round amount of cream. I find it be very good in a mix at 2.5-3% as a main note. 1% is closer to an accent and 5% is good for stand-alone.\n\n**Off-flavors**: I can't find any specific off-flavors in this concentrate. There are a hint of peel in from the blueberry, but that all boils down to wether you like that or not. It's so deeply hidden, that I can't see that being an issue and I find that it fits the flavor quite well. As stated above, you should probably keep it away from more sour/harsh flavors (TFA Sweet Tangerine, I'm looking at you here).\n\n**Notes**: Of the yogurts I have tried thus far, this one manages to hit the nail on the head. It's just about tangy enough to taste exactly as yogurt cup. The blueberry is both sweet and a little sour at the same time, which makes this flavor feel very natural and not candy-like. Nice round and smooth mouthfeel, as if you took a spoonful of blueberry yogurt right into your gob. I have zero issues vaping this as a stand-alone really.\n\n[**DIY\\_eJuice Flavor Reviews**](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)",

(Or maybe even closer to a café latte)\n\n**Throat hit**: Low to mid-low. There aren't much a scratch here, as it is very mild and round.\n\n**Uses and pairings**: We are definitely into the coffee and dessert area here. The cream is very much on the heavy side here in the range of 1-3%. There are a slight taste of coffee in this range, but I really find the coffee to first make a good appearance at 4.5-5%. Its good for a coffee base, but you need more coffees to make it vibrant. Something like CAP Cappuccino V2 or so. Concering desserts, the good amount of cream would work very well in desserts. Heck even in custards, utilizing something like INW Custard or FA Custard Premium (don't do FA Custard - the citrus note would turn weird). Coffee flavored cream biscuit anyone? Sure, why not! I feel you'd really need to push this a little high, like 2.5-3% for an accent of coffee here. For stand-alone you can probably push it higher than 5%, but my maximum for this test was 5% and the coffee was still lacking a little. Although, the cream does work very well as a substitute for other creams and I do find it superior to something like any bavarian cream. Come to think of it, this flavor and vanilla would go very well. I can also see this being used in sweeter tobacco recipes. Avoid anything you'd find gross with a coffee.\n\n**Off-flavors**: As a start, let me be straight with you here. I find no traces of burnt popcorn or skunk wee in this, which is a huge plus. I also detect some low notes of caramel, which aren't bad, but I'm not sure if this was intended. At the back-end, I do notice a very low note of plastic around 3% and up, but again that might just be me being a little sensitive to that, as I have those issues with many custards too (yeah VT Banana Custard, screw you).\n\n**Notes**: As stated above, it does lack some deeper notes of coffee. If you're gonna make a straight up creamy coffee, you will need another coffee to back it up. Which ever you use is on you. If your mix turns sour, don't blame it on this flavor at least.\n\n[**DIY\\_eJuice Flavor Reviews**](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)",

    "markdown": "*DuraSmoke sent me this flavor for review.*\n\n**Setup:** Wasp Nano. 6 wrap SS Clapton coil with cotton wick. 32 watts. 60VG/40PG. Flavor @ 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2%.\n\n**Notes:** Imagine a cinna-mint, but swap the mint with menthol. This is a mentholated candy cinnamon flavor (think Hot Tamales). The menthol is more of an accent and less of a main player. Like menthol tends to be, it's most noticeable on the inhale, and it's not overpowering in the slightest. I found it to be the strongest at lower percentages; it was most present at 0.5% and diminished significantly at higher percentages. It's a nice touch in that it seems to keep the cinnamon from becoming too powerful and overwhelming.\n\nThere isn't a ton to say about the cinnamon. Again, it's artificial cinnamon and not a bakery cinnamon. It's warm and candy-like, and it's got some sweetness that makes it more palatable and keeps the cinnamon from becoming astringent and bitter. The sweet note is most noticeable on the exhale. At higher percentages (for me, anything above 1.5%), things started getting a little uncomfortable. The cinnamon gets *too* warm. 0.5% is where I find the most even distribution of menthol and cinnamon. The menthol gets knocked down a notch or two at 1%. 1.5% is a solid candy cinnamon flavor with the menthol lingering discreetly in the background.\n\n**Mouthfeel:** I was anticipating a very dry, thin flavor, but it really isn't either of those things. The sweetness that's present kind of weighs things down and prevents things from becoming uncomfortably dry. The sweet note makes you feel like you had a cinnamon hard candy in your mouth at some point within the last half hour. This, in addition to the menthol, does a nice job of combating the wispy feeling that's present in similar concentrates. This flavor isn't juicy or heavy by any means, but it's heavier than you'd expect for an artificial, candy cinnamon.\n\n**Off-notes:** This is one of those flavors that you feel just a much as you taste. The combination of menthol and cinnamon sinks down into your lungs, so if you don't like that sensation, I wouldn't recommend this concentrate. Besides that, there isn't anything that's extremely off-putting here.\n\n**Suggested percentages and pairings:** Solo, this was most enjoyable at 1%. I'd stay below 1% in a mix. Unless you're using a low wattage setup, I don't see many scenarios where this would need to be mixed above 1.5%. It'd pair well with mints, and it could work well in boozy beverage profiles. I threw it in with some FA Fuji, and it kind of worked, so apple pairings would be another suggestion.",

Flavor @ 3% and 5%.\n\n**Notes:** This flavor is a definitely a tropical fruit blend. Just smelling the bottle, I feel like I can pick out melon, peach/apricot, and possibly papaya. Vaping it, I really feel like there's a creamy melon base and a peach/apricot top note. The peach is more of a sweet peach juice than a peach fruit, and it's most apparent at the end of the exhale. The melon has a generic melon taste but feels very thick and heavy. It's not watermelon, and I feel like its creamy taste pushes it in a honeydew or cantaloupe direction. The papaya sits in the middle of the mix, and it reminds me a lot of FLV's Papaya Punch flavor. It works well with the melon- it doesn't weigh it down too much, and it doesn't overpower the peachy top note. I occasionally pick up on a pineapple juice taste, but it's not prominent or dominant. When I first noticed the pineapple note, it made the entire flavor suddenly seem like a white gummy bear profile.\n\nThe flavor is supposed to be a smoothie, but it's a fruit-only smoothie. There's creaminess in the melon/papaya note, but that's it, and it's more of a quality of the melon than an actual added cream. I can't pick out any singular cream or yogurt flavor. I don't find this to be a bad thing, though. In fact, I think it works better this way. Everything feels evenly balanced, and I think the presence of a strong cream note would mute the intricacies way too much and throw things out of balance.\n\n**Mouthfeel:** This is really dense, especially for a fruit mix. It's smooth and thick without much throat hit. The thickness has a strong gummy/jelly candy quality. To me, this is more of a fruit snacks flavor than a fruit smoothie.\n\n**Off-Notes:** I don't find anything about the flavor to be off-putting, but if you're sensitive to the musty, funky taste that sometimes accompanies tropical fruits, you may not love this flavor. I can only really pick up on it at the very end, but it does hang around in the mouth for a bit. \n\n**Suggested percentages and pairings:** I was told by DuraSmoke to test their flavors around the 10% range, but after receiving the flavors, that seemed way too high. For RDA/RTA use, I'd shoot for 2-4% in a mix or 4-5% solo. 8-10% would be most suitable in a pod system or lower wattage MTL setup.  \n\nThis would pair well with other fruits, particularly orange, strawberry, mango, banana, pineapple, and guava. It'd work well in beverage and candy profiles. It isn't going to mesh well with dairy or bakery flavors.",

Flavor @ 3, 4, 5, and 10%.\n\n**Notes:** If you combined homemade vanilla ice cream and cake frosting, you'd get something that's pretty close to this flavor. Ice cream is obviously sweet by nature, and this flavor fits the mold. The vanilla is bright, light, and prominent (if you've had WF Vanilla Cream Extra, it's like that with a much stronger vanilla note). There's no vanilla bean or vanilla extract notes to be found- again, this is not a dark vanilla flavor. At a higher percentage, it has a TFA Vanilla Swirl vibe, but it doesn't have the dairy/buttery note that I frequently get from Vanilla Swirl. This isn't vanilla soft serve, but I wouldn't call it slow-churned ice cream either. For me, it's stuck in this purgatory where it's not rich or creamy enough to be a full-blown ice cream, and it doesn't have the consistency to be a frosting. I'd say it's more of an even split between the two, like a tub of vanilla frosting that was kept in the freezer for far too long. It can be a SNV if used solo but shines most after a bit of a steep. With a steep, the sweetness calms down, and the vanilla smooths out and feels less sugary.\n\n**Mouthfeel:** I love the way this flavor feels in my mouth. I've found that a lot of concentrates with the lighter vanilla note have a consistency that is somewhat thin, but this isn't thin at all. There's a thickness at the end of the exhale that makes the whole flavor seem full-bodied. It's super smooth with no throat hit whatsoever, and it leaves a sweet stickiness behind that's really enjoyable. It's heaviness increases at higher percentages.\n\n**Off-notes:** No unsavory  tastes to be found. It gets pretty sweet the higher it goes, and it borders on becoming cloyingly sweet. Some people might like that, and some won't.\n\n**Suggested percentages and pairings:** This is going to be be a reasonably versatile concentrate. It'd pair nicely with berries, cookies, and cakes. It could also help in providing a boost to vanilla notes in other creams without overpowering them. There isn't anything specifically that I'd avoid- it's a vanilla which is pretty agreeable with a lot of things. I'd recommend using this anywhere from 2-4% in a mix. As a solo, it was great at both 4% and 5%. I used it at 10% (solo) in an old Innokin T22 tank, and it came through wonderfully. I really enjoyed this flavor.",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Decadent Vapours Absinthe @ %5, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 14 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Absinthe, or more accurately all of the anise and herbal complexity from absinthe without that super hot, boozy back end. Anise right up front, with some greener basil or fennel herbaceousness .  Also it's a slightly radioactive light green color, so that's cool?\n\nInhale is all candied anise. Not super dense, and the sweetness level is pretty subdued. Exhale has that anise flavor right up front. Not just top notes but right down the middle of the vape as well. As that Anise tapers out a bit, green herbal fennel and basil shows up in the top notes and a base sweetness shows up.  Warm, floral almost spiciness there on top of that more solid anise candy base.  I also get some warm floral vanilla in there too. Still fairly thin and not super sweet, but nothing astringent or chemical there.  Mouthfeel is a bit drier than I'd expect, not really reading as a liquid. Lingering anise with just a bit of a tingly sensation. \n\n**Off-flavors:**  Nah, pretty much everything you'd expect from an absinthe flavor.  Solo, I feel like it's just a bit dry and I want it juicier to better mimic an actual liquid, but it's dead on to profile flavor-wise.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  So my personal achilles heel for this concentrate is that It's hard as hell for me to vape. I haven't really seen it mentioned anywhere else, so it may just be me. It seems to just tighten my chest up something fierce. It's not harsh at all, but I just cannot take large draws of this stuff. I don't have the same problem with a straight anise or some of the other herbal flavors I've tried, so I have no actual idea what's going on. I noticed it solo, as well as mixed. It gets a bit better as my throat acclimates, but I still feel like I'm fighting that mysterious chest tightness.  I've had a chest cold for going on about 2 weeks, but FWIW this seems to be making a pretty great expectorant... so have fun with that.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This will definitely work as a cocktail vape. It's a tiny bit dry for me solo, but with some INW Cactus or CAP Cucumber for some moisture I can definitely see rocking this as just an absinthe vape.  Also a good call in a cocktail that calls for absinthe. Bonus points for for the first person to nail a Corpse Reviver #2 vape.\n\nOutside of cocktails, good interesting component for fruit mixes. Dark berries, apples, and citrus would be my suggestions, but probably worth playing around with.\n\nAlso an interesting pairing with florals and herbal flavors like spearmint and vanilla.\n\nGood base for anise candy as well. No real booze here, but a strong, strong well rounded anise flavor.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nS&V concentration testing, 3% is too weak. I'm still getting some raw cotton in there. 5% is better, but still feeling a bit thin.  7% is getting me a nice thicker vape. The anise is definitely right up front, but it's a nice, round note that isn't a sharp, astringent kind of spice note and not so aggressive it just turns into black licorice. 9% is pushing it for me, as the sweetness is a bit much and you're losing some of the subtlety that keeps this from reading as black licorice.  I'd use this at 8% as a single or primary flavor, and mix at something like 5% for an anise component.\n\nI have absolutely no problem recommending this if you're into absinthe. The relatively high use percentage is a bit of a bummer, especially because I'm stuck having to order out of the country to get this stuff, although The cost isn't all that bad.  With the exchange rate it's about $3.50 for 10ml and chef's will ship an order for a flat $6.50.  They have a good selection of stuff that's hard to source domestically for 'muricans so it gives you a chance to pick up DV, Flavormonks, Solubarome, and strangely cheap 10ml sizes of the crazy priced Flavorah stuff (like a 70% discount on Alpine Strawberry which is crazy). Plus they carry Jungle Flavors, so it can save you an ECX order if you primarily order domestically with a different company.  Good stuff though, wish it was stronger and didn't constrict my airways... but it really is tasty.  I plan on taking this, mixing at 10%+ with 16mg and throwing it in my icare for a mtl type of vape.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nSo, /u/Runtdastardly is a fan. Their [Osiris](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/16475#osiris_by_runtdastardly) really is a great use of this concentrate. [Their notes on ELR are as follows:](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/1444)\n\n\"DV's Absinthe is the real deal. The hype is real, kids. It's a perfect representation, and that lovely, ectoplasmic green hue, which I hope is safe, looks exquisite in mixes.\n\nTPA's absinthe (yeah, that's right, lower case) is what DV Absinthe's is to a burrito at Chipotle VS a super carnitas burrito in Tijuana.\n\nDV Absinthe is costly for US mixers, but, IMHO, totally worth it.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Decadent Vapours Blue Limey, 5% and 10%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 20 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  A mix of musky blueberry and some sharper lime.\n\nConcentrate sort of leads with the blueberry, using the lime more as an accent.  I'd say the blueberry is more candied than realistic.  Not as artificial as something like HS Blueberry, but feels more like a much more filled in version of TPA's Blueberry Candy mixed with some Blueberry Wild. Heavy, syrupy blueberry base with some lighter hints of a fresher, slightly tart more realistic blueberry flavor.\n\nFairly prominent musk coming off that blueberry.  It's not really the musk of something like FA Bilberry with that more natural but ammonia-ish dark berry note.  Feels more like straight cologne type musk.  I've had another DV blueberry mix and picked up the same thing, so I'm guessing it's from the blueberry.  You kind of acclimate to it relatively quickly and it stops being as distracting, but everytime I pick this back up I have to work through it again.\n\nThat accent lime here has a moderately heavy acidic bite to the top end.  It helps to kind of clean up the sweeter blueberry and add some interest, but I could see it coming off as a bit aggressive.  There's also a heavier, almost waxy citrus base that shows up after the first couple of initial rips as those brighter, zesty volatiles vaporize away.\n\nRelatively full, thick texture.  The tarter parts of the lime thin this out a bit, but still feels pretty saturated.  Also on the sweet side.  Doesn't taste like an overwhelming sucralose kind of sweet, but on the sweeter side of a fruit mix.\n\n**Off-Flavors:**  There's definitely some musk here.  Moderate Old Spice type vibe.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light to moderate.  Not especially harsh for something with lime, but it does have a bit of bite on top of that smoother blueberry.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 5%, this feels more like a blueberry with a light lime accent. Fairly thick, heavy and sweet.  Light musk to this.\n\nAt 10%, the lime here seems a bit more prominent.  Quite a bit more zesty, and with some actual tartness coming in.  I'm also noticing some of that warm, waxy citrus vibe.  Blueberry actually doesn't seem all the much heavier than at 5%, and the general musk level is pretty similar.\n\nAs always, DV suggests 20%.  I'd stop pretty far short of that.  Just based on these tests, I'd use this at around 5% as primary flavor in a simple mix.  Solo, this gets a bit sharp for me near 10%... I'd probably stop around 8%.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  DV stuff is mostly set up for simple mixes, and this doesn't seem much different.  I'm not sure there is a way to really mix around the musk here though, you could try throwing another heavy, syrupy fruit at this like INW Shisha Strawberry hoping to lose some of the off-notes in a busier mix.\n\nSomething boozy might help hide some of that musk.\n\nYou could also play off the tartness of the lime with something bright like pineapple.  If you were going to add more citrus, I'd stick to something mellow and sweet.\n\nToo sharp and musky for a cream pairing, or probably any kind of bakery.\n\nOr maybe just rock it solo.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  DV also sells this as a finished juice, mostly likely around that suggested 20%.\n\n[If you aren't watching random British people do youtube reviews of juices Circa 2015...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIs8luIMGB0)\n\n[...I don't even know...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VI0jyq88-dA)\n\n[...what you're doing with your life.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Qbjd1idov4&t=340s)\n\n[Here's the product page from Decadent Vapours.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Decadent Vapours Cafe Brasiliano, 5% and 10%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 52 days.\n**Flavor Description:**  Drip coffee with a sweet cream and drier bakery texture.\n\nFairly aggressive coffee flavor right up front.  I don’t know if it’s from brazil or not, but it’s more of a strong drip coffee type of taste rather than a more intense espresso.  Moderate to dark roast, with a bit of bitterness to it.  Coffee feels a bit more bold than FA Up, but it has that same kind of drip coffee vibe. Seems to have some of the same drawbacks as other coffee flavors.  On the big scale of coffee skunkiness, this isn’t awful though.  While it definitely doesn’t solve the whole burnt popcorn dilemma, it isn’t as skunky as some of the worst offenders.  On a scale of 1 to FA Dark Bean, I’d probably give it a 6?  While it has some of the same characteristics of the more aggressive coffee flavors it doesn’t feel completely incinerated and the flavor here is relatively robust for not feeling like a lump of carbon. \n\nThe description here calls out “a little cream” and I could see that.  It’s a bit lost behind that more dominant coffee note but I do pick up some kind of cream.  Feels quite a bit sweeter and fluffier than just like a flat cream flavor, feels a bit like whipped cream. Depending on the temperature and the wick saturation, I’ll occasionally get a flash of a buttery or waxy frosting type flavor, but overall it seems fairly cohesive.  The description also says this is lightly sweetened and that fits. Sweet but not cloying, seems to be attached more to the cream than the coffee.\n\nThis vapes pretty warm, which probably fits with the coffee profile, although it feels a bit dry.  It has an almost bakery like grain to it that doesn’t seem to quite fit with the description.  It’s probably just the coffee doing it’s thing, but it reminds me a bit more of a bakery than a hot cup of coffee.\n\nCoffees tend to decimate wicks, but this doesn’t seem especially bad.  No real coil gore, but my wicks are a little crunchy after 10mls.\n\n**Off-Flavors:**  Dryer bakery texture.  Usual weirder coffee burnt popcorn notes, but relatively workable.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light.  Nothing that really stings but can get a bit dry and harsh for me solo.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 5%, this is definitely coffee forward.  Heavy, but not burnt coffee flavor with some sweeter, fluffy cream backing.  Balance isn’t terrible, but could probably use some more cream. Moderately dry and sort of bakery-ish.\n\nAt 10%, that coffee is considerably more aggressive and is drowning out all of the cream for me. Seems even drier, and is starting to push toward burned and bitter.  Feels like overkill up here.\n\nDecadent Vapours has their usual 20% and adjust for taste thing, but I’m going to pass on that.  That coffee is already pretty aggressive at 10%.   I’d probably be fairly low on this, like 2-3% if you want to do anything but make a straight coffee vape. For those kind of vapes I’d probably kick up to 6-7% with some cream backup.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I don’t think is going to change anyone’s mind about coffee flavors, but it isn’t bad in the context of existing coffee flavors.    I’d use it a lot like FA Up in general, with a slightly bolder coffee flavor.\n\nYou could definitely add more cream.  There is already some richness here, so I’d more be focused on adding a lighter cream to kind of cut this back a bit and make it vape more like a beverage.  This might work well for a coffee ice cream though.\n\nDecent start for a tiramisu, especially with that sort of bakery dryness.  Good excuse to add a sponge cake type bakery and maybe some additional whip cream.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  [I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again… British juice review youtube is the best youtube.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeGkLznKYkQ)\n\n[Here is the product page from DV.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Decadent Vapours Carolina Original, 5% and 10%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 56 days.\n**Flavor Description:**  Mellow, straight forward tobacco.\n\nPretty staright-forward flavor here.  I’m pretty sure it’s just tobacco.  Moderately prominent dirty absolute base notes, along with a pretty mellow shag type lighter tobacco. Seems like some kind of permutation of a relatively neutral American tobacco.  Might lean more towards brightleaf or flue-cured with some light woody notes and a bit of tartness.  Non-aromatic and nothing too bold or spicy. More grassy than leafy, with a pretty strong hay note.  Seems sort of comparable to a slightly more robust version of something like HS Instrument.  Fairly easy-going, even with those dirtier, slightly ashy notes.\n\nMouthfeel is a bit thin.  No dessert or darker notes to really thicken this up.  Pretty neutral sweetness, but it doesn’t taste sickly or cloying to me.  A bit of astringency, but nothing really aggressive or bitter.  Feels a bit dry overall, but nothing too crazy.\n\n**Off-Flavors:**  Nah, not really.  Pretty straight forward and nothing weird.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light.  Gets a bit dry solo, but nothing major.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 5%,  lightly dirty and ashy and some dry hay notes.  Not particulary aggressive here but it does have at least a decent body to it.  Seems a bit unsatisfying here.\n\nAt 10%,  this is quite a bit dirtier, but those hay notes have more dimension to them and have started to come across more clearly as a tobacco leaf.  Very mild sweetness.\n\nDV usually uses a 20% suggestion.  Just based on these tests, I don’t really want this all that prominent in a mix.  I’d mostly be using this as an accent at around 7% behind more aggressive tobaccos.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I haven’t really had much luck working grassier tobaccos into much but pretty solidly tobacco vapes, but YMMV.\n\nThis is a bit green for any dessert tobacco uses.  The light tartness may go well with realistic fruits, but I’d worried about the mix tasting a bit too fresh with the grassy notes here.\n\nI’d mostly use this to bulk out or fluff up a heavier, darker tobacco.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  Pretty sure this one is a bulk or wholesale only flavor and I can’t find any real info on it.\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Decadent Vapours Creme Anglaise, 5% and 10%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 60 days.\n**Flavor Description:**  Moderately thick vanilla custard with caramelized brown sugar.\n\nSo a crème anglaise is essentially a thinner, sauce style of custard and I think that fits here.  It’s definitely in the custard family.  Moderately full mouthfeel overall, but not quite as crazy heavy as something like CAP VC1.  Probably a bit lighter than INW Custard as well. This is apparently Diacetyl and Acetyl Propinyl free, so all things considered it’s fairly rich but it doesn’t have a thick, buttery punch to the bottom end.   Light egginess, and something that tastes like a heavy cream accent.\n\nPretty solid vanilla accent to this as well.  Maybe a bit brighter than a bakery vanilla.  DV calls out brown sugar and caramel in the description for this, and it seems to be adding some depth and darkness so it doesn’t come across as too much like a frosting vanilla.  Those molasses brown sugar notes seem to come out on the back half of the exhale.  The caramel here feels more like a marketing thing, and I’m not really getting anything like a caramel sauce to this.  I do get some caramelized sugar though on top of that molasses.\n\nThere seems to be something a bit smoky in the finish.  It’s a bit hard to really nail down, but it feels maybe just a bit burnt.  I’m guessing it’s attached to either the brown sugar or caramel.  I’m not sure if an overly aggressive brown sugar note, or too deep of a caramelization to the caramel, but the very tail of this flavor is a bit jarring.  It sort of pulls the concentrate out of a straight custard and into a crème brulee.  It almost adds something a little spicy to the back end, sort of like a light cinnamon.\n\nSweeter concentrate overall.  Pushes cloying for me, but I do have a joyless DIY palate, so YMMV.\n\n**Off-Flavors:**  Tastes smoky on the back-end.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light.  Starts fairly smooth but that brown sugar can read a little harsh, at least solo.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 5%, the brown sugar is working a fairly subtle accent for the custard base.  Vanilla is in pretty well check.  Good balance here, but it feels a bit thin.\n\nAt 10%,  that brown sugar seems a lot more prominent, and it’s getting a bit dry.  Solid custard base with a moderate density.  Vanilla is strong but not overwhelming.\n\nDV has their 20%, but that brown sugar note seems to be picking up substantially as this goes higher.  Just based on these tests, I’d be using this a primary flavor around 8%, and an accent around 3-4%.  I think as an accent you’ll get more custard and brown sugar flavor than actual custard mouthfeel and texture.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Hey, a custard without too much butter.  Why not just run with the crème anglaise thing.  More of a custard topping than a custard base.  Would work well with brighter fruits like strawberries.  I could also see this working with bakeries fairly well, but I’d watch out for that brown sugar picking up harder, darker notes from crispier bakeries.  Seems like a really interesting pairing for a desert tobacco mix with that brown sugar.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  Again, we head to the well of youtube reviews.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Decadent Vapours Crystal Blue, 5% and 10%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 60 days.\n**Flavor Description:**  Blue berries and anise with a minty finish and a whole lot of blue dye.\n\nFruit forward flavor.  Decadent Vapours calls out juicy forest fruits and grape in the description for this, and that seems like a pretty good place to start.  I do get some artificial grape from this on the front end, especially after coming back to it after a while.  That grape impression fades for me pretty quickly though, and I’m thinking it’s mostly blueberry and raspberry after that.  The blueberry is aggressive and fairly artificial.  It reminds me a lot of HS Blueberry, and not really a tarter realistic blueberry like FA Bilberry.  The raspberry here mostly shows up after that blueberry.  Blends fairly well with that bright blueberry but I do get some more ketchupy TPA Sweet Raspberry-esque notes that show up closer to the tail of the flavor.  I’m also getting sort of weird blue raspberry peachy or pineapple note to this that sort of comes and goes. Feels a bit reductive to try to start picking all the fruit apart though, because it does come across as a fairly cohesive candy “berry” flavor without suffering from that medicinal generic mixed berry flavor.\n\nLight aniseed accent here.  I wouldn’t call it full on to a black licorice flavor, it’s subtle enough to mostly complement that candied berry flavor as opposed to really stick out as an individual component.  I’m not anti-anise so YMMV, but for me, at least, this isn’t overpowering.  I also pick up a good amount of something like spearmint.  Moderate menholation at 10%, not painfully cold or anything like that.  Light hint of an actual green spearmint flavor in here. \n\nSweet overall.  Toes the line on cloying for me at 10%.  Seems to be pushing “commercial” juice levels of sweetness but I haven’t been noticing any heavy sucralose buildup on my coils, so seems to be implemented fairly well. Full, thick mouthfeel in general, and the mentholation seems to clean up the exhale a bit keeping everything from getting too sticky.\n\nIt’s blue though.  Like really, really blue.  There is a lot of dye in here.\n\n**Off-Flavors:**  Sure, it tastes like a crystal, but there is no reason this has to be neon blue.  The food coloring is stupid and serves no conceivable purpose here.  Otherwise, fits the profile and nothing that tastes chemical or subjectively unpleasant, at least to me.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Not really? I mean the mentholation hits like it should, but nothing that really stings or feels like it’s unduly harsh.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 5%, this maybe seems relatively heavy on the grape.  Feels more like a combo of Grape, Sweet Raspberry, and Spearmint.  Anise accent is pretty mellow here. Still relatively full and sweet.\n\nAt 10%,  This tastes quite a bit “bluer” than 5%. Grape seems to be taking a back seat to that heavy blueberry and the raspberry is getting just a bit ketchup-y with extended vaping.  Anise is present but not overwhelming.  Cool but not cold, mentholation is still pretty pleasant.  Sweet, almost syrupy mouthfeel.\n\nI tried this up at 20% and it was a bit overwhelming.  Too sweet, too cold, and that anise was making everything bitter.  Just based on these tests, I’d probably stick closer to 10%.  I feel like I’m getting more than enough out of this flavor at 10% but it’s still pretty bold.  If you wanted it a bit less intense though, 5% isn’t a bad place to start.  Don’t worry, it will still be hella blue.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I mean, this is a pretty good solo flavor.  Sweet, full, smooth, and minty with a bit of an interesting anise twist.  Seems really well balanced and pretty satisfying by itself.\n\nHocusKrokus aka Kopel is something like 98% sure this is the basis for Vampire Vape’s Heisenberg, He has a pretty rocking beard, so I’d believe him.\n\nBut yeah, I’d probably stick to this solo.  I don’t think it would taste bad with additional berries, grapes, mint, or even a more over peach or pineapple, but this seems to be pretty well balanced by itself. \n\n**Second Opinions:**  Youtube reviews mostly.  \n\n[Those](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJGLEjTHjcA) \n\n[are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_flo60Vljp8) \n\n[definitely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSHRo18sMxg) \n\n[a thing.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7A5-BtU9aM).\n\n[Here is the product page from DV.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Decadent Vapours Dandelion and Burdock @ %3, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 24 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Bitter and darkly herbal, complex and sweet enough for the base for an herbal liqueur.\n\nInhale is deeply sweet with a slight sourness.  A deep kind of sassafras herbal note with moderate density.  Exhale opens up with a herbal dandelion flavor with some bitter anise-y top notes.  Again, herbal but not that kind of swampy vegetal type of taste you get from overcooked greens.  Hard to find an exact analogue, but it's built like FW Sassafras although it doesn't really taste anything like it.  Some lingering horehound hard candy kind of sugary mouthfeel and bitter dandelion top notes.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  I've never had actual dandelion and burdock soda, so I have no clue. Nothing seems out of place though.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Light, mostly chest tightness on the inhale.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I picked this up exclusively because I thought it might be a good base for something like an Italian Amaro, and I think it fits the bill. It's herbal, bitter, and sweet without being like a swampy vegetal flavor.  I think the thinness here is the major drawback, and you'll have to do something to address that without taking the concentrate in an astringent direction. I'm thinking a soda base will be the play, so I'll be mixing this with FA Cola for a take on an Argentinian Fernet and Coke.  I also find myself wanting just a touch of mint in there, so INW Natural Mint for a spearmint.  This concentrate could stand in for a Jagermeister base, if you want to avoid the weird flat anise-bomb style of existing concentrates.\n\nBeyond cocktails, your guess is as good as mine. Good addition to INW Rhubarb to make it taste more like an authentic rhubarb.  Might have a place in the right kind of fruit mix, but you're on your own there.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nS&V concentration testing, 3% is a bit weak. Still getting some raw cotton and vg taste around the edges of the flavor.  At 4% I get more of a licorice taste. 5% is good, but pretty anise heavy.6% just gets me straight herbal anise and the bitterness is getting weird.  I'd mix with this at 4% for a primary note, and 3% to add that herbal complexity in the background.\n\nYeah, probably a niche flavor but if you're remotely interested it's worth picking up. I'm really looking forward to getting a chance to work with this a bit more.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Damnit, /u/HocusKrokus.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Decadent Vapours Earl Grey Tea, 5% and 10%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 50 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  A drier black tea, relatively heavy on the bergamot.\n\nThe tea here is largely solid if a bit light on flavor at the tested percentages.  Black tea astringency, actually feels a bit tannic and dry for something based on a liquid, but it does sell the tea thing fairly well.  Recognizable black tea earthiness, but on the subtle side.   Pretty nondescript but pleasant.  Very light bitterness, but nothing that feels too earthy or aggressive.\n\nThe “earl grey” part of this, the bergamot, is coming on fairly strong for how relatively subtle that base tea seems. The bitterness of the bergamot comes through pretty clearly, with some of those bitter orange zest notes.   A bit of a floral edge here as well, but it works pretty well the tea. Seems fairly accurate.  Peppery bergamot notes are present, but this feels more weighted toward the bitter rather than spicy side.\n\nMouthfeel overall feels maybe a bit dry and thin.  The bergamot was out of control for me at the DV suggested 20% but the vape itself was even drier, so I don’t think it’s a concentration issue here. Drier than FA Black Tea or FLV Black Tea for me, even though the actual tea flavor seems a bit less aggressive than either. Sweet enough to vape well, but doesn’t really seem like a heavily sweetened tea.  Maybe a light bit of sugar, but nothing approaching full tablespoons or honey or whatever.\n\nNo mention of cream in the description for this, but there is definitely some cream added in the [product photo on the DV website.](https://decadentvapours.com/shop/diy-e-liquid/flavour-concentrates/earl-grey-tea-e-liquid-concentrate/)  I don’t pick up any kind of cream in here, FWIW.  I’m not picking up anything that tastes like dairy.\n**Off-Flavors:**  Vapes more like dry tea than a hot cup of tea.  Nothing out of place for earl grey though.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Moderate? The dryness, florals, zest, and peppery notes can get a bit much and there isn’t a lot of body to smooth it all out. \n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 5%, this feels a bit underflavored to me.  The drier mouthfeel is still in full effect, but I’m losing the actual tea flavor behind the bergamot.  \n\nAt 10%,  this is again pretty dry.  I’m getting more that tea flavor though, and it seems a bit better balanced with the bergamot.  Bergamot is getting a bit peppery though.\n\nDV suggests their usual 20%, and nope.  That bergamot and dryness is even more intense.  Just based on these tests, I’d be using this as a primary flavor, with something behind to bulk it out a bit, around 8-10%.   I’m not sure where you’d use an earl grey accent, but it would probably work around 3-4% for that. \n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Not a bad earl grey solo, but feels like it needs some volume.  Just messing around, I mixed some of my 10% tester of this with 2% FLV Black Tea and it seemed to add some warm tea volume and made it vape a bit more like a hot beverage.\n\nNot particularly sweet, some sucralose would probably add some sugar here.  You could also go with a relatively non floral honey like FA Honey or even some VT Golden Syrup for additional sweetness.\n\nOr hey, cream.  Add your fresher cream of choice.  I’d stay away from anything too buttery as it would probably get a bit weird with the bergamot, but this should work well with FA Fresh Cream or that OOO milky undertones that I refuse to buy.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  I’m not finding anything out there via google.\n\n[Here’s the product page from DV.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Decadent Vapours Ginger Biscuit, 5% and 10%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 52 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Thin crunchy ginger cookies with a whole lot of dried ginger. \n\nThe bakery here is definitely the British / almost everywhere else version of “biscuit.” Thinner, crunchy digestive type biscuit that skirts more up against a cookie than anything savory.  Lighter biscuit with a sort of coconut background note like INW/JF/CAP SL Biscuit.  That coconut note is sort of my personal cross to bear, but this seems to have less coconut to it than the CAP SL version but more than INW or JF.  Definitely a cookie, with ginger as opposed to a gingerbread cookie or a gingersnap.  No heavier, darker molasses taste and the mouthfeel is a bit thinner and crispy as opposed to really thick and chewy.\n\nBiscuit seems to be taking a bit of a backseat to a fairly heavy dried ginger.  Doesn’t feel sweet enough to really call it candied ginger.  More of a straight, dry bakery ginger.  Probably tastes most similar to HS Ginger although it’s also pretty close to standard FW Ginger.  Fairly spicy and prominent in the overall mix.\n\nAt least with this kind of steep, and at these percentages, this feels just a bit thin.  The mouthfeel on the biscuit part of this seems a bit thin while still being crispy and the ginger is kind of top-heavy and one note.  Also not as sweet as I’d expect, which is a bit odd from decadent vapours.\n\n**Off-Flavors:**  Nothing that really feels like it shouldn’t be here.  Seems a bit coconut-y to me, but that is just the biscuit.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Yeah, but ginger. Fairly aggressive ginger bite, but nothing out of line for the profile.\n\n**Percentage testing:**At 5%, this has a lot more ginger to me than biscuit.  Ginger is dry and spicy, with some thin biscuit accent on the backend.  Overall seems to vape a bit flat and feels thin.\n\nAt 10%, still a whole lot of ginger but there is a bit more biscuit.  Still kind of dry, and the biscuit is still a bit flat behind that aggressive ginger. Feels a bit less thin, but still not a really full satisfying vape  without a heavier bakery to soak up some of that ginger\n\nDV has their 20% or to taste thing, but as a S&V at 20% it didn’t really boost the bakery up for me so much as amp up the ginger to a pretty unpleasant place.  I’d mix with this closer to 10-12% with something to fill it out a bit. \n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Overall, this feels just a bit thin to me and I’d rather fill out the bakery by adding a bakery than trying to chase down more bakery texture behind that more aggressive dry ginger.  Should work well with some CAP Sugar Cookie or VT Pudding Base to add a bit more bakery grain.  If you wanted to double down on the thin and crispy thing, INW Biscuit should work.  I’d be a bit more scared of a more aggressive AP like FA Cookie, this feels crispy enough on it’s own.\n\nOutside of just filling out the cookie, you could maybe throw an ice cream or custard at this?  The texture that is here should hold up well and the ginger will come through pretty clearly. \n\n**Second Opinions:**  I can’t really find much out there about this.\n\n[Apparently this used to be called “Vapefest Original.”  I’m just going to keep posting British juice review youtube links until someone makes me stop.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0Xlsg8-qBc)\n\n[Here is the product page from DV.

Feels heavy and syrupy, without much in way of fleshy or juicy realistic notes.  Base of the flavor has some that bright \"red\" type candy guava hawaiian punch sweetness.  I am getting some offsetting tartness.  It doesn't really add to realism, but it adds some contrast to that guava candy flavor.\n\nWhile this flavor starts out pretty normal, it gets odd on the finish.  The off notes are kind of all over the place.  There's a bit of floral bitter edge to this, much more noticeable up high.  Guava is kind of notorious for being musky, and I'm definitely picking up just a bit of that.  It isn't musky like TPA Guava or even VT Guava, but it's there and kind of gives some low range punch to those bitter floral top notes.  This also tastes strangely metallic to me.  I'm thinking it's tied into the tartness somehow, but it has a fairly pronounced metallic tang right on the back end.\n\nHeavier, syrupy hard candy type texture to this.  Definitely sweet, but the tartness keeps it from going too cloying.\n\nThe closest guava flavor to this I've tried is probably [FE Guava](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/7pvtw7/flavor_express_guava/).  It has that same kind of heavy candy vibe.  This is a bit tarter and more complex, but the FE version doesn't have as much baggage in terms of off-flavors.\n\n**Off-Flavors:** Gets floral and musky, especially at higher percentages. Odd metallic finish.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light, pretty smooth overall.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 5%,  this is a recognizable candy guava.  Maybe a bit soft and lacking some vibrancy. Sweet with a light sour tartness.  Minimal floral bite at the end, with a small bit of that metallic tang.\n\nAt 10%,  this is heavier, syrupy, and reads more as a solid candy guava. I am noticing more of the off flavors though.  Moderate higher floral note, with a slight baseline musk.  Tastes fairly metallic to me.\n\nDecadent Vapours uses an across the board 20% recommendation for it's flavors.  Even though this is probably one of the weaker flavors I've tested from them,  that's probably still overkill.  Just based on these tests, I'd probably be using this around 6-8% as an accent flavor.  I think taking it higher would help with some vibrancy but the off-notes become a problem.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I think most of using this is going to be about accentuating the candy front end of this while trying to clean up the backend.  The most obvious route would be to pull a Manson, and add a really, bright vibrant lime. Since INW is not to be trusted with their reformulations, FLV Lime is probably the biggest, brightest lime on the block right now.  Should also work well with a sweeter lime like FW Key Lime.\n\nSort of in the same vein, a heavy orange or pineapple flavor would do a lot of the same work on this.\n\nBooze flavors would also clean up the backend, so maybe break out the rum.\n\nA more textured candy flavor like Cap 27 Fish, 27 Bears, Jelly Candy, or PUR Jelly Candy would also probably take care of cleaning up the finish and work well with that candy guava.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  I'm not seeing anything really out there about this one.  I'm also not seeing it listed up on their website, so it may be wholesale only or a newer flavor.\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Decadent Vapours Kiwi, 5% and 10%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 18 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Candy Kiwi, all the way.\n\nPretty solid kiwi base flavor here. Starts off with that pretty normal melon mixed with candy strawberry thing.  Definitely reads as kiwi, and honestly doesn't seem all that different from most of the other available kiwi flavors.  The finish on this is interesting though, ends on something that reminds me a lot of TPA Pear Candy.  This is maybe a bit flatter than  the other kiwi flavors I've tried, with a really subtle green pear tartness instead of something kind of tangy and bright.\n\nTexture here is heavy, slightly warm, and syrupy. Fairly dense for a fruit flavor.  Texture isn't anything like a real kiwi, feeling more like a slightly warm hard candy flavor.  Pretty heavily sweet, and gets a bit sticky and cloying at least for my joyless DIY palate.\n\nThis feels like an even more syrupy and candied version of FW Kiwi with less tartness.  If FW Kiwi was a soda, this feels a lot like the syrup they would use.\n\n**Off-Flavors:**  Not really a bright, realistic kiwi.  More flat and candied.  Nothing offensive or weird though.  The more I vape it, the more the pear thing comes through.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Nah.  Smooth AF.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 5%, this is definitely still candied kiwi, but it doesn't really have that thick, syrupy base.  Still feels warm and thin, but maybe a bit dry.\n\nAt 10%,  I'm getting more of that pear accent at that end.  Thick, sticky texture.  No off-notes for a candy fruit flavor.  Pear vibe seems to be picking up.\n\nThe blanket DV 20% isn't quite as insane with this one.  While I'm getting a pretty full flavor out of this, there is nothing weird, floral, or chemical that makes me think it couldn't work higher.  Just based on these tests,  I'd be using this as a primary flavor in a non-complicated mix around 6-8%. \n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Decadent Vapours' flavors are more formulated to be ran solo or in relatively simple mixes, and this bears that out.  Seems pretty well balanced if you want a sweeter, solo kiwi.  Adding some WS-23 would help to clean up some of the stickyness and warmth here.\n\nOutside of running this solo, should stand up well to a really, heavy, syrupy strawberry like INW Shisha Strawberry.  This is also flat enough that it could take some tarter fruit or even citrus without getting too tangy and acidic.  Or maybe just add a watermelon candy type flavor.\n\nOr hey, accentuate the pear candy thing and add some more pear.  Should work well with candy texturizers. Actually kind of reminds me of a juicy pear jellybean, so maybe figure out a jellybean texture and dump in a brighter pear like INW Pear.  And then share it, because I'm not actually sure how you'd do that.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  Again, we're flying mostly blind here.\n\n[Here's the product page from Decadent Vapours.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Decadent Vapours Kola, 5% and 10%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 36 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Tart, herbal take on a cola.\n\nFeels like more of a cola base than a completely finished cola.  Tart bordering on sour base.  Seems to aiming more at the acidic part of a cola, doing a fairly good job on conveying a pretty heavy bite.  Pretty intense solo, without much in the way of vanilla or caramel to balance out that aggressive sharpness.  I think I’m picking up some lemony citrus here as well, which is definitely contributing to that bite.\n\nRelatively heavy herbal cola notes.  A bit medicinal and slightly bitter, this seems like a pretty accurate cola top note.  The acidity and the bitterness here does a fairly good job simulating whatever passes for carbonation in vaping, feels at least lightly fizzy.\n\nTexturally, this has a thinner, sort of wet texture like you’d expect from a beverage-type vape.  No built-in cooling or anything like that, but does a pretty good impression of a soft drink mouthfeel.\n\nTrying to put this in some kind of broader cola context, this doesn’t have all that much in common with something like FA Cola which comes preloaded with a pretty intense hit of vanilla and caramel.  This is more acidic and beverage-esque than the Hangsen Colas.  I haven’t gone too far down the TPA Cola rabbit hole, but this feels like it has some of that same bitter, herbal, and acidic qualities of TPA Cola Fizz does as an additive.  I haven’t done full testing on it yet, but just by some preliminary mixing, Vape Train Cola seems like it’s on a similar wavelength to this one.\n\n**Off-Flavors:**  Tart acidic take overall, without the fuller vanilla or caramel you’d expect.  Pretty heavy lemon.  Slightly bitter solo.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Moderate to Harsh.  Not really a chemical throat hit, but it has a pretty intense acidic bit to it.  It’s pretty brutal solo.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 5%,  this mostly feels tart.  I’m getting some of the cola herbals but no real vanilla or caramel.  Light lemon bite.  Plenty of acid, not too much flavor.\n\nAt 10%,  this is tarter and probably a bit too harsh solo.  Cola herbals are getting a bit bitter.  Still no real vanilla or caramel to speak of.\n\nDecadent Vapours has a usual 20% suggestion, and just nope. I did a S&V at 20% with this and felt caustic enough to strip paint.  Just based on these tests, I’d probably be around 8% with this in a cola recipe, assuming you’re going to bring in some vanilla or caramel to try to knock the more aggressive edges off this.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  To fill this out as a cola, I’d throw in some vanilla and some caramel.  I’d probably use a spicier vanilla like FA Vanilla Bourbon or FLV Vanilla Bean.  No real reason why you couldn’t use a brighter, frosting type vanilla like FA Vanilla Classic if that was your thing.  For the caramel, I’d be partial to FW Salted Caramel, but whatever.\n\nWould work well on top of a sweeter, flatter cola like LB Cola Freeze or TPA Cola Syrup.\n\nAlternatively, could be used for something like a cola gummy which has that cola flavor but not the accompanying vanilla and caramel.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  Looks like another bulk or wholesale flavor and I can’t find much out there.\n\nI will say, I have no clue how this relates to their “Classic Cola” flavor, but hey, it can’t be that different, right?\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

    "markdown": "**Setup:** Recoil w/ flavor barrel, Dual 15 wrap 26g 3mm Nifethal 70 coils @.13 ohms.  60w power, 450F temp limit. Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Decandent Vapours Lime Zinger @ 4,8,12% 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 6 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Less than a week after this [exhaustive discussion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGzmA2zfXMY&t=252s) and me threatening to knife fight people over INW Lime vs. FLV Lime as the preferred green slush flavor, this is basically a green slush in a bottle... with issues.  Brighter, sharp candy lime flavor with some heavy, syrupy sweetness and a fine carbonated/gritty texture. Sweeter and fuller than FLV Lime solo, but with the same kind of green skittles bordering on cleaning product taste. As about as close to carbonated as you're going to get out of an e-liquid, with a fine, gritty texture that emulates ice crystals without any of the attendent cooling. As for the issues, it's weak, expensive, fades out, and is a bit hard to source.  I'd recommend using this for green slush or beverage applications damn near close to a single flavor.  You're probably looking for at least 8% flavor up to 12% and you're going to want to get to it within a couple weeks.\n\nInhale has sharper lime up front. Very much a \"green\" flavor.  No real zest to it, but it's still pretty sharp. Some deeper sweetness, still lime, but more of that lime sno-cone syrup artifical lime flavor. Moderately dense mouthfeel without any real harshness. Exhale has that bright green lime flavor up front, with kind of carbonated texture. Not really the same thing as real carbonation, but almost a fine gritty texture that could concievably remind you of carbonation if you're feeling generous.  Good amount of sweetness, maybe just a touch light on the side.  Doesn't go full syrupy, but it manages to stick to your mouth a bit. Again, moderately dense but not really harsh. A bit sharp, but not a lot of throat hit, especially for a citrus. Lingering artificial \"green\" lime flavor.\n\nWorth noting that I've got a noticable decline in flavor between the fresh stuff I'm mixing for concentration testing and the steeped samples.  Some of the artificial \"green\" starts to fade out a bit. It's still got a decent amount of flavor, but it seems a lot more vibrant fresh. I'd mix small batches and aim to use a mix with this as a primary note within a couple weeks.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Not really, they describe this as \"light and citrusy with pleasing notes of fizzy sherbet.\" It maybe skews closer to artificial \"green\" lime, but it's not cloyingly artificial.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  This is sharp flavor, but I wouldn't call it harsh. It's a lime that doesn't have much in the way of throat hit despite being a fairly bright flavor.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  The Decadent Vapours stuff I've tried is really tasty, but a bit hard to mix with.  They tend to be relatively full concentrates that require higher percentages. I feel like this fits that pattern. I think, by itself, this does a pretty good job of being a sort of kool-aid version of a limeade flavor.  If you can find a cherry that doesn't make you want to slam your head into a wall, I think it would be a great base for a cherry limeade.  You could also sub out the cherry with raspberries or something like FA Forest Fruit for something similar that would be a lot easier to balance.\n\nWith a little bit of cooling, this would make an excellent green slush flavor. I still want just a bit more sweetness in here, either from a sweetener or even better INW Lime, but I feel like it's 90% of the way there. \n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, this is going to take a pretty heavy hand to get things really popping.  At 4% this is pretty weak. Doesn't feel especially thin or harsh, but just weak.  Even as an accent I feel like this needs more to fill out. 8% still feels just a bit thin. Like I'm getting more of a flat slush base than that nice bright \"green\" flavor. Probably more workable down here with other concentrates but it's lacking a bit of charm. 12% is just on the verge of being too much. Bright, interesting lime, but it's just barely pushing into cleaning products and tasting a bit antiseptic. I think the sweet spot for this concentrate is going to be around 10% mixed fresh, so maybe 12% with a short steep.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Here's the product page from Decadent Vapours, their description is \"light and citrusy with pleasing notes of fizzy sherbet. A wonderful palate cleanser.\"  There's a couple reviews on there, all pretty positive. One user calls its \"subtle\" while others use \"slush\" and \"green starbursts (opal fruits).\" I'm not sure what a green starburst is supposed to taste like, but it does have a lime candy thing going on.](http://decadentvapours.com/shop/diy-e-liquid/flavour-concentrates/lime-zinger-2/)\n\n[Here's the reviews for the finished juice, I'm guessing its 20% at 50/50.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Decadent Vapours Long Island Ice Tea, 5% and 10%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 21 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Yeah, that's a Long Island Ice Tea.\n\nOverall, this tastes surprisingly accurate to profile.  Simulates that weird hangover alchemy that makes a Long Island Ice Tea.  In general, no single part of this feels out of balance enough to really stick out.\n\nI do get some distinct cola bite out of this.  Feels maybe just a bit heavier than a splash, but doesn't pull the entire thing off profile.\n\nI'm thinking they went with a pretty basic sour mix kind of citrus here.  I'm not picking up anything distinctly orangey from a triple sec.  Some candied lemon-lime tartness with some decent vibrancy.  Doesn't really feel like fresh lemon juice, and has a thicker kind of sticky sweetness.  The lemon here seems to get a bit waxy for me, but only after a couple of drags when the tarter parts of the lemon die down a bit.\n\nThe booze here seems a little light until you start hitting a fairly obscene mixing percentage.  At lower percentages, seems to make the cola just a bit spicier.  As the percentage goes up you get more definition on those boozes.  Not quite accurately boozy, but does actually taste like a mix of vodka, gin, tequila, and rum without some of the punch.\n\nWith the sweeter citrus, heavier cola, and *relatively* sedate booze, feels a whole lot more like a fast-casual, we pour short, 2 for 1 tuesdays kind of cocktail than a truly hideous and judgement-decimating highball with your buddy behind the bar.\n\nModerate fullness.  There is a syrupy sweetness to this, but it doesn't really cohere into something super dense and thick in terms of mouthfeel.  Definitely sweeter overall, and gets cloying, especially at the tail end of the exhale.\n\n**Off-Flavors:**  Nah, not really.  I think the citrus gets just a bit waxy and warm.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Moderate, but it kind of fits with the cocktail profile.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 5%,  this feels a bit flat.  It has a quite a bit of sweetness, but not much brighter tartness. The cola is fairly prominent, and the booze more accents than stands on it's own.  Tastes a bit like a spicy version of pepsi with those lemon accents.\n\nAt 10%,  this is a bit more vibrant.  It doesn't feel that much heavier or even sweeter than 5%. Citrus has picked up quite a bit, and I'm getting sour mix distinct from sweet cola. Booze still feels kind of light though, and this feels a bit waxy and warm.\n\nI wasn't really feeling like this was filled out at 10%, and so went full DV crazy mixing percentage and tried this at 20%. Granted, this tester only has a couple day steep on it, but it largely works up that high.  It's starting to get fairly boozy and closer to an actual cocktail.  Maybe a half-step back from a realistic hot booze note, but it's definitely got all the support flavors and reads pretty clearly as booze.  Doesn't seem to get more syrupy this high, more just fills out the cocktail side of this.\n\nSo, just based on these tests, I'm probably going to be on the high end of mixing percentage.  I'd mostly be rocking this solo, and I'd probably start at 15%.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This is pretty much just a solo flavor.  I mean, it's a Long Island Ice Tea.  I can't think of anything else that I'd really want to add to this or anything this could really be added to.  It could maybe use a bit of WS-23 to cool it off a bit and cut some of the cloying sweetness in the finish.\n\nI suppose if you want your Long Island more dive bar than Applebees, you could perk up that boozy note just a bit.  The Vape Train boozes would be pretty good at adding some authentically dangerous tasting kick here.  Light Rum would probably fit the best, although their Russian Vodka would also do the trick.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  So this was originally part of their \"taste of america\" line that has mostly migrated over to their wholesale or bulk list.  I can't find any kind of reviews or notes on this.\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Mild chocolate, without a really aggressive darker cocoa taste.  Nothing too sour or butryic.  The chocolate here isn’t too fruity or too plastic, at least at tested percentages.  Does seems to get a bit dry but not aggressively chalky either.  Missing anything waxy like TPA Double Chocolate Clear.  Drier, cocoa type body without much mouthfeel.\n\nThis vapes a whole like chocolate syrup, which seems to be about par for the course with milk chocolate flavors.  While I’m am getting a milk chocolate appropriate type of cocoa level, it just doesn’t have much in the way of richness or body behind it.  It’s not exactly thin, but the chocolate here feels a bit one note and not particularly saturated through the entire flavor. \n\nPretty accurately sweet to a milk chocolate, but not completely cloying at tested percentages.  Not a super dark concentrate, and seems no gunkier than TPA Double Chocolate Clear.  Wicks have gotten a bit crispy and flavor starts to feel muted with extended vaping, but no horrendous coil gore.\n\n**Off-Flavors:**  Pretty standard lack of richer chocolate body.  Mostly just a slightly dry chocolate syrup type vape instead of some magical chocolate bar.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light to moderate, seems to get a bit dry and harsh solo.  Some of that could just be the wicks getting crispy.  Less harsh freshly dripped.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 5% this is feeling fairly light.  I’m getting some drier cocoa flavor here, but the actual chocolate feels pretty thin on top of a sort of neutral base.  Nothing particularly rich at this percentage.\n\nAt 10%,  the chocolate is coming through a bit more clearly.  That cocoa note seems a bit deeper and less dry.  I’m still not sure this is clicking for me as rich.  It’s sort of thick without feeling especially creamy.\n\nDV has their usual 20% rating, and this felt a little chalky and plastic-y up that high.  I didn’t think it really offered much of a benefit for the extra 10%.  Just based on these tests, I’d probably be using this around 12-14% as a primary note, and maybe 6-8% as an accent.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Serviceable milk chocolate flavor, but I’m not sure there is anything to really recommend it over something like JF or FLV Milk Chocolate or FA Chocolate, especially given the difficulty in sourcing and pricing. \n\nIn general, it’s going to do a bit better with something heavy and creamy behind it to stand in for a richer cocoa butter base.  You’re mostly looking at custards or maybe a heavier cream like a Bavarian or thicker whipped cream.  Some Acetyl Pyrazine can also help solidify the chocolate as well.\n\nStick it any place you’re looking for a sweeter chocolate accent, basically.  Chocolate flavors in general seem to kind of diffuse through a vape instead of really keeping any texture or separation, so you’re probably better off trying for a chocolate ice cream instead of a chocolate chip ice cream, just by way of an example.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  This is another bulk or wholesale from DV, and I’m not seeing much info out there about it. \n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Decadent Vapours Mojito, 5% and 10%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 22 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Mint forward sweet mojito flavor with rum and lime accents.\n\nThe mint kind of dominates here. I'm not getting anything too leafy or green, but the mentholation is a definitely a spearmint and not a more generic peppermint. Maybe not so much muddled mint, but it's not too bad based on the some of the spearmints I've tasted. Moderate coolness here, not painfully icy but fairly cold overall without blasting the profile out entirely with raw tasting menthol.  I am getting plenty of the sugar from the muddled mint though.  Pretty sweet overall, but it tastes like more of a white sugar sweetness without any really aggressive aspartame type notes.  Overall stops short of full toothpaste, at least the tested percentages.\n\nThe rum here is pretty competent.  Not really boozy, but definitely has a white rum kind of funk to it. Rum doesn't really ever step up to the front of the vape to me, but it fills in the gaps pretty well.  What I can taste of it seems pretty accurate to white rum, but the sweetness makes it kind of hard to get a read on.\n\nThe lime component here is relatively sharp.  The combo of the mint and the lime can come across just a little bit cleaning product but settles down a bit. Not too candied, but definitely sharp without having a realistic zest note.  More like Rose's lime juice than a couple of lime wedges.  I do pick up a bit of warmth and waxiness from the lime, especially with prolonged vaping.\n\nOverall the balance is probably mint heavy, but the balance is alright if you want that more artificial mojito flavor.\n\nI mean, the concentrate doesn't seem like half sugar syrup so it's already better than FW Mojito.  No major coil gore after vaping through 15mls of this stuff.\n\n**Off-Flavors:**  More of a \"mojito\" flavor than an actual mojito.  Mint is a bit aggressive, lime is one dimensional, and over all it's pretty sweet.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Moderate, but spearmint, rum, and lime are all fairly throaty to start.  Nothing chemical or unpleasant.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 5%, this feels a bit more balanced than higher concentrations. Lighter rum, moderate lime, and moderate spearmint.  It's also not cloyingly sweet.  Probably doesn't taste like an actual mojito, but not bad at all.\n\nAt 10% the mint is quite a bit more aggressive and that sweetness takes off a bit.  Starting to get a bit of a mint gum vibe from the relatively heavy mentholation and higher sweetness. Rum is getting pushed around pretty bad, but the lime mostly works here.\n\nDV has their usual vaguely lunatic 20% suggested mixing percentage and that kind of seems like overkill.  Based on how that mint is ramping up and bullying the rest of the juice, I'd probably stop well short of that.  Just based on these tests, I'd probably go around 6-8% with this a relatively strong primary flavor.  I tried a S&V with this at 20% and that mint and sweetness was going full toothpaste to me.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Works pretty well as a solo flavor.  I mean, you could just add some VT Light Rum to hammer that booziness in a bit.  I'd maybe add some TPA Champagne to thin this out a bit as well, but that's just me.\n\nDecent base to throw a pretty aggressive fruit note in as well.  It's a bit of steamroller so you'd want to use a heavier hand with your fruit percentages.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  Again, my googling has failed me.\n\n[Here's the product page from DV.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Decadent Vapours New York 60, 5% and 10%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 56 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  More dessert than tobacco.  Caramel, coffee and biscuit mostly.\n\nFor me this leads with a pretty heavy digestive biscuit style flavor.  Less coconut off-note than I’m used  to with that kind of flavor, seems pretty well done. Mouthfeel is fairly crispy.  As the vape goes on I’m picking up some distinct softer caramel notes with a bit of buttery vanilla, and a moderately aggressive coffee finish.  Sort of tastes like a tiramisu type flavor, but with biscuit instead of sponge cake.  Distinctly sweet, with a bit of a stickiness to it from the caramel.  \n\nAnd coffee, there’s a whole lot coffee in here.  I feel like the biscuit is hiding some of the more aggressive burnt popcorn notes that tend to pop up with coffee. This leans very hard into the “dessert” part of “dessert” tobacco.\n\nWhat I’m not really getting out of this is a whole lot of tobacco.  It could just be vaping the subtle-as-a-sledgehammer absolute style decadent vapours tobaccos, but I probably wouldn’t pick out tobacco if it wasn’t called out in the description of the flavor.  The tobacco here feels like it meshes in pretty well with those coffee notes.  Really settling in, you do start to get a really light hint of ash and a little dirtiness but it’s fairly subtle and used more as an accent for those more prominent bakery and coffee notes.  I could just be looking too hard for that tobacco.  \n\n**Off-Flavors:**  Pretty light on the tobacco for something described as “a rich and soft tobacco.”\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Moderate.  This feels a bit dry to me solo.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 5%, this feels dry and a bit flat. Clear biscuit, and coffee, but it feels pretty thin without heavier caramel.\n\nAt 10%,  this is fuller and the caramel is coming through a bit more.  Not much tobacco at all, but the biscuit and coffee combo seems to be working pretty well.\n\nWhile I wouldn’t quite hit the 20% DV talks about, this feels like it does have a bit of headroom at 10%.  I’d be more likely to use it at 10% with a tobacco accent filling the rest up, but you could probably rock this solo closer to 15%.  I’d use as a bakery accent closer to 5-6%.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Seems like a dessert tobacco base.  I'd stick with nuttier or more mellow tobaccos, and maybe just crank the caramel up.  Would work really well with your RY4 of choice.\n\nMaybe still just a bit dirty to use as a non-tobacco.  Probably doable, but I'd watch for those ashy notes.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  [Decadent Vapours sells a line of pre-made juice called “Djinni” and New York 60 is one of them.  Planet of the Vapes had a review of the line posted up.  Selected notes from their review: “ I get the hints of caramel, the main vanilla and the hints of coffee, it's the biscuit that surprises me. It doesn't really taste of biscuit but instead tastes of waffles… All the ingredients balance well for me… Throat hit is mild like you'd expect from a dessert flavour… A very unique flavour that I encourage you all to try.”](https://www.planetofthevapes.co.uk/reviews/e-liquids/vapemaster_djinni.html)\n\n[I’m pretty sure this guy invents vacuums or sells that dumb looking jukebox thing in unskippable youtube ads for a day job.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Decandent Vapours Orangella @ 5 and 10% 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 7 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** [Orangina (warning: link contains hilarious sexy animals, but there is technically a bottle of the stuff in the corner. It's just too beautiful not to share.)](http://img21.mtime.cn/mg/2010/11/30/145514.37859514.jpg) Not quite an orange soda, not quite orange juice. Kind of tastes like orange pith and Tang mixed together, but a whole lot better than that sounds. A bit sweet for straight navel oranges, with a bit of something that feels quite a bit like carbonation. Works really well as a single flavor, but feels like it would get watered down really quickly in a mix. Needs around 10% to get going, although good up to about 15%.\n\nInhale has sharper orange right up front. Not really a zest flavor, per se, but some of that same kind of peel oil brightness and just a bit of bitterness that reminds of the actual skin and pith on an orange segment. Maybe a bit bright and sweet for normal grocery store navel orange, closer to a tangerine but not too candied. Sticky sweetness underneath that, with a lot of texture if not a real density. Almost gritty, simulating some carbonation. Exhale is pretty spot on for the aforementioned Orangina. Orange zest top notes but less bitter and sharp. Base flavor tastes a lot like Tang, definitely citrus but not a whole lot of body. Still pulling off the carbonated thing fairly well. Sugary sweet but not cloying, really well balanced overall. I get some moderate harshness on the exhale, with lingering orange pith.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  I'm not sure if this was meant to be modelled on the orange version of limoncello, but it doesn't really hit that for me. It's a bit too light and sparkling for the heavy and syrupy orangella. For something pushing towards Orangina, no off flavors.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Moderate. It's definitely there. Not horrific for a citrus but still a bit harsh on the exhale.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I wouldn't mess with this too much. Between the balance of the tarter more realistic orange, the Tang-ish body, and the carbonation I don't feel like this needs a lot of help anywhere to pull off a sparkling orangeade.  I could see maybe a lime accent, or some cooling if you're feeling crazy, but adding other strong non-citrus flavors is going to to screw your balance up and I can see that Tang base getting watery pretty quickly.\n\n**Notes:**  So pretty par for the course for Decadent Vapours, this is going to end up needing a high percentage to really come through. At 5% it's thin.  You get mostly the Tang out of this, with the more realistic orange notes and carbonation way too light. At 7.5% it still feel pretty thin. More realistic orange, but still tastes pretty watery. 10% is a a bit disconcertingly light for such a high percentage, but it's starting to feel like a full flavor.  Realistic orange, Tang, and carbonation is all present. 12.5% is orangier, seems like a better single flavor option than 10%. I'm getting a pretty noticeable uptick in harshness though. 15% is fairly harsh but tastes more like an orange than Orangina.  Pretty harsh though.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\nNot a lot for the concentrate.\n\n[Here's the product page from Decadent Vapours, their description is \"A mellow, mouth-watering all-day-vape with a main body of fleshy orange and a welcomed subtle tanginess at the finish.\"](http://decadentvapours.com/shop/diy-e-liquid/flavour-concentrates/orange-flavour-concentrate/)\n\nHere are some reviews for the finished juice (probably 20% at 50/50...\n\n[An actual written juice review.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Decadent Vapours Parma Violet, 5% and 10%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 50 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  A chalky violet candy. \n\nCandy take on a violet.  It’s still definitely floral, but at lower percentages avoids coming off too much like laundry soap.  The violet itself seems pretty well balanced between a light, almost citrus tartness and the more floral perfumey parts.  Nothing really green or vegetal like eating the whole flower.  Light anise kind of note reinforcing the floral violet, but it doesn’t feel out of place and may be somewhere in the candy base.  That baseline anise twinge feels kind of Necco wafer-ish.\n\nThat floral is tempered quite a bit by a candy base.  Feels like a ‘murican smarties type compressed sugar and starch. Dry, chalky, and fairly sweet.  The base here adds a thicker mouthfeel and fleshes out those floral notes so they don’t feel thin or too perfumey.  Dense, dry mouthfeel overall. Accurate, dryer sweetness to that type of candy.\n\nOverall this seems really similar to TPA Cherry Blossom in terms of how the actual flavor works.  Whereas Cherry Blossom is a very “pink” kind of floral candy, this definitely feels “purple.”  So, this is a purple version of TPA Cherry Blossom.  That’s some quality describin’, right?  Comparing this to FA Violet, the extra body here really helps it from seeming as soapy and aggressively floral as FA can get.\n\n**Off-Flavors:**  A violet candy, as opposed to just a straight violet.  Nothing that feels like it shouldn’t be here though.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light. Fairly smooth, although this can get a bit dry and harsh for me with extended vaping.  \n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 5%,  I’m getting a clear violet flavor.  The florals here are actually pretty well balanced with that chalky candy base, although it does feel just a bit more like a candy with violet than a violet candy.\n\nAt 10%,  those florals are starting to get a bit soapy and aggressive for me.  Base is mostly keeping up and feels a bit thicker but has started to get a bit too dry overall.\n\nDecadent Vapours has their usual stratospheric 20% recommendation, but that seems like overkill.  Just based on these tests, I’d be around 7% as a primary or solo flavor and I’d bail before it got too soapy. Should work well as an accent around 2-3%. \n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  It’s been a fairly long time since I’ve had them, but solo this seems pretty much like a dead ringer for [parma violet candies.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parma_Violets)\n\n/u/hocuskrokus is a crazy person.  His purple mango recipe, [Violet Beauregard](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/39457#mango_beauregarde_by_kopel), is probably one of the tastier examples of this.  So violet and fruit can definitely be mixed.  He got some interesting mileage out of pairing violet with FLV Guanabana and FLV Mango.  Using some of the body here, I’d guess you could cut out a bit of the creamy backend and make something even more candy-like. He kept mumbling something about Mango and Violet sharing volatiles, but you could probably do some really fun things smashing this together with other tropical fruits like pineapple and coconut.\n\nI could see this pairing well with citrus in general.  Should mesh really well with the sweeter lemon concentrates like FA/CAP Lemon Sicily or JF Juicy Lemon or a tangerine/mandarin flavor.  A tarter, more realistic lemon like INW Lemon Mix would probably up the laundry soap thing quite a bit though, so maybe don’t use that.  In general, I’d stay away from really harsh, zest heavy citruses like grapefruit or some of the limes. \n\nOther fruit pairings are going to be a bit tricky and probably hit-or-miss.  I’d stay away from anything too floral in general.  You should have better luck with slightly syrupy fruits like TPA Pomegranate Deluxe or FLV Boysenberry.\n\nIf you really had a mind to mix a violet with cream, this would probably work a lot better than FA Violet without any extensive tinkering.\n\nA bit dry to try turn into a crème de violette, but it could probably work out at a lower percentage.\n\n**Second Opinions:** [British juice review youtube is the best youtube.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmDtkjEqQZI)\n\n[User “hxj” has a review up on ECF.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Decadent Vapours Raspberry, 5% and 10%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 16 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Candied raspberry base, with some tarter top notes.\n\nPretty heavily sweet raspberry flavor.  Thick, syrupy candied base here. Probably on par with INW raspberry for thickness.  Top notes are a bit more tart and realistic but they feel pretty overwhelmed by that thicker base. Overall effect feels more syrupy and candied than a fresher raspberry flavor.\n\nI am picking up some greener flavors out of this that don't quite mesh with the candied base.  Feels a lot like the greener notes out of FA raspberry. Not overwhelming, but pretty noticeable at 10%.  Doesn't really seem to have the corresponding perfumey floral note.  This also picks up some of that ketchup vibe, pretty noticeable in the bottle, but not obnoxious vaped.\n\nDecadent Vapours says this has: \"a hint of cocoa,\" but I'm not really getting that at all. Could be that I'm not up at their recommended 20%, but this tastes bereft of cocoa to me.  I do pick out just a little bit of vanilla, but it's not as aggressive as the vanillin in some of the peach/apricot flavors.\n\nComparing this to some of the other raspberries I've tried, this feels a lot like a greatest hits kind of raspberry.  It has that heavy, syrupy vibe of INW Raspberry, some of the almost herbal muddiness of FA Raspberry, and just a touch of that patented TPA Sweet Raspberry kind of ketchup vibe.\n\n**Off-Flavors:**  Hint of vanilla, some muddy green notes, light bit of ketchup.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light to moderate, the tarter part of this is a bit harsh but nothing too pronounced.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 5%,  clear candied raspberry base.  That tarter, fresher is a pretty subtle accent here. Feels just a bit light and thin.  Not noticing that vanilla, light ketchup note, and that green weirdness is pretty subtle.\n\nAt 10%, this is thick, syrupy, and a bit warm. Tartness seems maybe half a step in the background from the 5% test. Vanilla is creeping in, I pick up a still light but more noticeable ketchup, and the greener notes are sticking out a bit more.\n\nJust based on these tests, I'd probably be using this an accent around 4%.  I think it gets most of the point across while still leaving some room to work and avoiding the worst of the off notes.  As a primary or solo flavor, I'd probably be closer to 8% where the base really fills in.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**   Seems like more of a solo raspberry than anything else.  It's a big, full flavor that doesn't seem to leave a lot of head room for other concentrates. \n\nI think you could put this in a richer custard or ice cream base, although it maybe tastes a bit candied for anything but a really sweet raspberry sauce or a raspberry ripple. I think it will push around any lighter, fresher creams or even whipped creams.\n\nCould work well in candy profiles where you're basically just adding texture.\n\nCould stand to be brightened up with some citrus, but will stomp all over any more realistic fruit you try to pair it with.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  Not finding much out there about this one.\n\n[Here's the product page from Decadent Vapours.

It almost vapes like vanilla frosting.  Not a juice that tastes like vanilla frosting, but actual vanilla frosting.  It’s almost disconcertingly thick and full.  Vanilla feels a bit bright and commercial as opposed to something darker and spicy.  Pretty distinct buttery richness though, with a moderately heavy coconut note to it.\n\nDV calls out vanilla and tobacco and they are both definitely in there. The tobacco here is a bit dirty with some of that classic absolute ash note.  The tobacco itself isn’t all that prominent though.  It’s a light enough touch and that vanilla is bold enough that it’s working as an accent.  It’s like dirty vanilla ice cream.  Some drier, hay notes underneath everything but it’s pretty well lost in that vanilla.\n\nMouthfeel really is very thick.  Seems more buttery and rich than oversweet, but definitely lands on the dessert side of tobacco even with those light ashy notes.\n\n**Off-Flavors:**  I get a pretty solid coconut off-note out of this.  Not unpleasant, but maybe a bit weird.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Nah.  Super smooth.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 5%, vanilla is still thick and smooth.   Tobacco is pretty light here, and tastes more like hay than ash.\n\nAt 10%, that vanilla is crazy thick and I’m getting a pretty rich buttery note.  Coconut is a lot more noticeable here.  Tobacco accents have gotten a bit dirtier but still haven’t really taken over.\n\nDV has their 20% suggestion, but I’m good lower than that.  Just based on these tests, I’d probably be using around 10% solo.  I’d be more likely to use it an accent though, probably around 6%.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  With that really heavy, thick vanilla this would make a killer vanilla for a pipe tobacco mix.  It’s going to need a hell of steep, but I threw some INW Black for Pipe in one of the testers and it seems to be working really well.  Those ashier, dirty notes aren’t really clashing with the vanilla as much as I’d think.\n\nBeyond just a pipe tobacco, a smaller percentage could work up against a nuttier tobacco or something with chocolate notes like FLV Red Burley.  Caramel would help dessert this up even a bit more.  You could do a pretty neat vanilla RY4.\n\nIn general, I’d call this more of a vanilla additive for tobaccco mixes as opposed to a solo flavor, unless you really like the idea of a frosting tobacco.  I mean, i’m not opposed to that.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  [This apparently used to be part of the DV Djinni line.  Vaping with Vic has a review up for the finished version of their Red Tab Juice.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Decadent Vapours Rhubarb, 5% and 10%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 32 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Baked rhubarb base, with just enough raw rhubarb to keep you on your toes.\n\nWarm, sticky rhubarb base.  Accurate-ish to a baked, sweetened rhubarb filling for a pie.  Slightly brighter and tarter then you'd expect, but that pectinish stickiness keeps in the baked category.  Fairly deep and robust rhubarb flavor.\n\nThere are some things stopping that base from just working as a baked rhubarb though.  There is a muskier floral sharpness to this.  That musk isn't really overwhelming, but it tends to show up in mixes.  There is also still a bit of raw rhubarb type astringency here. Not nearly as tart and astringent as INW Rhubarb, but it's in there and sort of works against that deeper base.  Lastly, I get just a touch of earthiness here but it doesn't seem particularly out of line for rhubarb.\n\nIt's not saying much, but this is definitely sweeter than straight rhubarb would be.  I'd call it fairly sweet overall, somewhere between pie filling and candy sweet.  Seems to carry the more distinctive parts of the rhubarb fairly well.\n\nWhile not a dead-on ringer for a baked rhubarb, it's quite a bit closer than INW rhubarb.  Where INW is extremely tart and leans a bit green, this is substantially darker feels a bit stickier and deeper.\n\n**Off-Flavors:**  Lightly musky.  Slightly astringent and vaguely earthy.  It's mostly peeled rhubarb.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light to moderate. This can get a bit sharp but nothing overwhelmingly harsh.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 5%, this has a relatively full rhubarb flavor but feels a bit sharp.  Most of the livelier tart, musky, and astringent parts are there in full effect, but that heavier, sweeter base hasn't quite filled in.\n\nAt 10%, the base here is definitely fuller and the flavor has quite a bit more sweetness balancing out some .of those more aggressive notes.  A little bit jammy and sticky, but still a bit short of baked rhubarb solo.\n\nDecadent Vapours has their usual 20% recommendation here, but that feels like overkill.  Just based on these tests, I'd be mixing with this as an accent around 4% and a primary flavor in a mix closer to 8-10%.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Well, if you manage to get your hands on this maybe mix up [this recipe](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/recipe/1344014/Rhubarbara:%20A%20Star%20is%20Born) because it has a picture of \"A Star is Born\" era Barbara Streisand.\n\nBeyond that, this does feel like it's going to be a bit easier to make work in bakery and custard applications standing in for a baked rhubarb.  You could try to \"cook\" it a bit more with some FA Liquid Amber or TPA Kentucky Bourbon.  But yeah, this is a good jumping off point for a baked rhubarb type application with or without berry companionship.\n\nNot too dark or cooked to work in fruit mixes either.  Should pair well with the usual suspects like strawberry, raspberry, and apple.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  So unfortunately this is another one of DV's bulk or wholesale only flavors currently.  Having tried thier \"Bluebarb\" one shot and their \"Rhubarb Cuddle\" I'm fairly sure it's all the same base rhubarb.\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Decadent Vapours Rhubarb Cuddle @ %3, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 25 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  More rhubarb than cuddle. Sweet cooked rhubarb way up front with some flatter almost ice-cream base kind of creaminess. [Decadent Vapours calls this \"A warming embrace of tangy rhubarb paired with a generous dollop of sweet and creamy Crème Anglaise custard.\"](http://decadentvapours.com/shop/diy-e-liquid/flavour-concentrates/rhubarb-cuddle/)  They definitely stick the landing on the cooked rhubarb.  Admittedly, it's been a minute since I made a creme anglaise, but the warmth here is taking away from some of the richer notes and volume I'd expect giving the custard component a flat affect.\n\nInhale is warm and slightly tart rhubarb with some floral french vanilla kind of top notes.  Exhale has baked rhubarb right up front.  Some of those higher rhubarb green notes, but pretty subtle, especially compared to a brighter rhubarb like INW. The custard shows up on the backend, but there's a hint of weirdness while those greener top notes clash with the custard as its coming in. Custard tastes more like a creamier ice cream base.  I'm not getting a ton of eggy richness but that could be the rhubarb or the overall warmth of the vape.  Lingering flat vanilla cream and green top notes on the tail end of the exhale. Sweetness level overall is actually pretty restrained, which is nice. \n\n**Off-flavors:**  It's not an off-flavor per se, but I really do feel like the warmth here is just interfering with the way the vape works. It makes it fairly difficult to get a nice deep draw on the inhale, and it substantially flattens out that custard back end. It's actually a really solid flavor, I just don't see too much of a way to smooth this back out so you can enjoy everything going on.  Would possible work better as a MTL type flavor.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Warm, super warm as a DTL Vape.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Rhubarb fruit cobbler or crisp a la mode? The rhubarb here would pair well with strawberry or raspberry and the custard, with some backup, could definitely stand in for a scoop of ice cream. You'd need a crispier topping, almost like a granola flavor. The warmth here could carry a cobbler or crisp.  Or a pie, for that matter.\n\nAlternatively, you could just add in some Vanilla Custard v1 and steep it for a month for a fuller take on a rhubarb custard.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nS&V concentration testing, the vanilla definitely starts picking up as you increase the concentration. At 4%, the vanilla and custard notes are little more prominent. At 5%, the rhubarb is still there, but the vanilla is getting a bit unblanced. Moving above that, at 6-8% it starts tasting like a green version of TFA Dragonfruit and vanilla frosting. A steep should help a bit, but it seems too aggressive to be all that pleasant. I'd mix with this between at 3-4% if you're adding a creamy component and maybe 5-6% if you're going to be adding in more fruit but want to rely on this concentrate for your creamy notes.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Really good youtube tasting here (starts at about 7:00 in.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZDYKMrTkck) Dead on to my experience with this stuff.

It's definitely interesting.  Sort of similar to root beer, but with a more subdued wintergreen note, heavier anise, and lot less creamy caramel sweetness.  [DV's website calls it \"A delectable balance of bold flavours; vanilla, caramel, wintergreen and licorice.\"](http://decadentvapours.com/shop/diy-e-liquid/flavour-concentrates/sarsaparilla-eliquid-concentrate/)  Yeah,  I can definitely pick all those out, but I dare you not to pick up a traditional pink bubblegum here.\n\nInhale is mostly anise top notes with an almost marshmallow fluffy sweetness.  Exhale hits you with that pink bubblegum up front. Anise top notes again, with some wintergreen and a tiny bit of cooling showing up towards the back end of the exhale. Base flavor is like a thick cream soda sweetness with some flatter non-floral vanilla. Moderately dense overall.  Top notes read a bit bitter and leave a lingering medicinal kind of taste. Sweetness seems a bit low at first blush, but I think that's because I was expecting more of a \"root beer\" flavor. Taking this on it's own merits, sweetness level is doing the job.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Nah.  Pretty much what they say on the box.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Nope, but some mouth numbing.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Your boutique old-tyme root beer recipes. Per FDA regulations, legally requires a handle bar moustache somewhere on the label.\n\nI think my preferred use is going to be a solo flavor. Complex, herbal, and sweet all the same time.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nS&V concentration testing, 3% gives you a good helping of each flavor in the concentrate but it's lacking the punch for a solo flavor. 4% seems to be a bit more wintergreen forward, with a more noticeable cooling. by 6%, it's seem pretty anise-forward but that sweeter cream soda will show up with a steep. 8% is getting sweet enough it just reads as weird pink bubblegum.  I'd mix with this at 3% in a root beer or sasparilla recipe with some creamy caramel and wintergreen backup. I'd recommend 6% solo.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Someone's published a recipe with this, I'll give you one guess who it was.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/recipe/1045565/Fountains)\n\n[Youtube review.

A good deal like the lemon curd in a lemon meringue pie, or a lemon sorbet flavor with some cream behind it. Close to a more mellow FA Lemon Sicily mixed with the softer, waxy mouthfeel of a whipped cream. \n\nInhale is slightly harsh, warm, and almost a lemon candy flavor. Exhale starts off with bright sweet lemon curd. Lemon flavor is right down the middle with a bit of juicy roundness and without much in the way of sharper, zesty top notes.  Maybe just a hint of like a buttercream type of taste on the back half on the exhale with that same kind of distinctly waxy mouthfeel.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Nah, although that mouthfeel is straight waxy.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Moderate. Not terrible, but that lemon hits a bit rough.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  A lemon for mixing with creams, primarily. I'd use it for ice creams, sherberts, lemon frosting, or custards.  Also seriously reminiscent of a lemon curd, so bakeries like lemon meringue pie or lemon bars.  Mouthfeel won't work with drier lemon bakeries, they really need a cream or curd component.\n\nHeavier mouthfeel will be a good fit for lemon candies.\n\nToo waxy for mixing without some serious consideration for the mouthfeel here.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nCocentration testing, at 3% the flavor seems weak and a bit unsaturated.  4% is a lot more solid in flavor, and that lemon is bright while still being balanced out with the creamier element here.  Starts tasting more like a lemon drop kind of candy. 5% is super bright, and by 6% it starts to get a bit bitter and astringent.  I'd mix with this at 4% for a strong, lemon curd note either in ice cream or bakeries.\n\nA good lemon curd flavor, with some potential for candies. Lmiited utility from that waxy mouthfeel, though.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nSo, like usual, /u/HocusKrokus beat me to this one. [He posted a Crema Di Limone recipe that takes advantage of mouthfeel here that looks pretty great, especially the addition of lavender.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/recipe/1058255/Crema%20Di%20Limone)\n\n[DV's own description of this flavor is quite a bit different from what I get, they say \"A mouthwatering steam fresh on the throat with citrus top-notes with fizzy after-tones.

What they don't mention is that waxy mouthfeel and the dairy element here. So, I guess YMMV a bit.

Seems to stop a bit short of being truly burnt or scorched though, at least at these percentages.  More of a caramelized top note, on top of a softer butterscotch candy type of base. Some buttery richness here, which takes the harder edge off the caramelized sugar notes.  Definitely has a bit of the butterscotch vibe that DV calls out in the description.  Feels a bit richer to me than FA Butterscotch, with a smoother creamy component.  I’m also picking up a light vanilla, but it doesn’t really seem out of place.\n\nSo theoretically toffee is a harder crack dessert, but texturally this actually seems a bit richer and almost chewy.  While those caramelized notes sort of tend towards a harder toffee, the texture manages to be a lot softer than that. Comparing this to a harder caramel flavor like FA Caramel, this has a lot more texture without picking up too many of those weird cardboard notes that softer flavors like CAP Caramel can pick up.  Seems to strike a pretty good balance between chewy and crisp.\n\nSweeter vape overall, but not too cloying or sucralose heavy.  Not a complete coil disaster, at least after 15ml.\n\nI haven’t tried a ton of toffee flavors, but this does seem considerably softer and richer than at least FLV Toffee, VT Hard Crack Toffee, and VT Honeycomb. It’s a lot less toasty than VT Hard Crack, but probably a bit darker than FLV Toffee and considerably darker than the honeycomb.\n\n**Off-Flavors:**  Softer, chewier texture than a hard toffee… but I’m not really complaining.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light.  Gets just a bit harsh on the throat despite the smoother texture.  I think it’s the caramelized sugar notes.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 5%, this is relatively blonde.  I’m still getting those caramelized sugar notes, but that softer, chewier base is coming through pretty well.  Sweet but not obnoxious, with a a good deal of richness carrying all that sugar.\n\nAt 10%,  feels a bit darker.  Seems to be drying out a bit and getting a little bitter.  Soft base is still there, but those caramelized sugar notes aren’t quite sinking into that richer base and feeling really cohesive. \n\nJust as a quick S&V at DV’s 20% this tastes a bit too burnt for me.  Just based on these tests, I’d probably be using this mostly as an accent around 3-4%.  If you wanted to solo this, I’d shoot for closer to 8%. \n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This feels a bit soft for a hard toffee component in a mix for me.  Doesn’t seem like it really hold it’s texture like toffee chunks in a mix.  \n\nI’d use it more like a fancy caramel sauce.  I’d pair it up against ice creams or custards, and in deserts with a caramel component like a caramel apple pie.  Something about the richness here also reminds me of a tres leches cake too, so that could be fun.\n\nAnd hey, you could make a pretty tasty spin on a RY4 with this.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  [All youtube reviews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcieAbdsikE)[ all the time.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_t-T9ewo0tw)\n\n[Here is the product page from DV.

Feels like a french vanilla type, weighted a bit heavier toward sweet and bright rather than dark and spicy.  Vanilla steamrolls the custard a little bit and seems to push around the custard notes.\n\nModerately prominent custard underneath all that vanilla.  Pretty solid eggy note, but maybe not as rich as I’d guess given the relative prominence of that richer custard note. Feels a bit warm and moderately full.  No really pronounced dairy here.  I’m not really picking up a thicker cream or buttery backup.  Nothing sour or butyric though.  I’m not tasting any spice or anything else really unexpected.\n\nThere’s a sort of dryness here for me, and I’m thinking it’s a fairly heavy hit of maltol.  I have the same issue with Capella’s vanilla custard v1, it ends reading a bit chalky for me.  I’d guess that if you don’t have the same reaction to something like CAP Vanilla Custard, this wouldn’t seem nearly as dry.  Overall a solid, but not really heavy or rich mouthfeel.  FWIW, this is apparently Diacetyl and Acetyl Propinyl free, and it does a fairly good job of bringing some body to the table without having either diacetyl or a heavy butyric note.\n\nClosest comparison for me with other custards would probably be that Capella Vanilla Custard.  This has a really similar flavor without the buttery richness that the Diacetyl in V1 brings to table.\n\n**Off-Flavors:**  Not really, although that vanilla feels too aggressive for that custard base.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Fairly smooth, probably? I get a good amount of maltol dryness out of this, but beyond that nothing harsh.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 5%,  I feel like I’m getting a solid vanilla custard flavor, but not much body or depth. Vanilla forward, light custard.  Feels top heavy though.\n\nAt 10%,  i’m getting a lot of vanilla with some eggier custard accents.   Seems to be getting just a bit chalky for me. Moderate thickness without any really heavy buttery low-end to this.\n\nDV ballparks 20%, but that vanilla is already plenty aggressive for me at 10% and I don’t really see this getting magically richer up that high.  Just based on these tests, I’d be between 10-12% as fuller custard base or maybe 4-5% as a custard component in a mix.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  As a custard base, I’d basically use this like CAP VC1 without the exotic lung danger.  Should pair well with the usual custard suspects including caramel, brighter fruits, and tobacco.  Without that heavy DAAP punch this isn’t going to layer as well and won’t do as solid of a job of sitting in the right place in a recipe, but it’s a pretty good option that isn’t either vomity or lemony. \n\n**Second Opinions:**  Another bulk or wholesale flavor.  I’m not really seeing anything out there on this.\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

It’s definitely a very traditional tobacco forward concentrate.  Nothing smokey but a pretty intense dirty ashiness.  Robust and dark tobacco flavor, with some heavier roasted coffee or cocoa notes and a moderate amount of sweetness to it.  Bitter accents, being picked up by the herbal or botanical side of this.\n\nDV calls out “botanical” notes here, and that’s probably a pretty good description.  I’m picking up something like an aniseed or licorice.  Seems to come across more like sassafrass than anything else.  It’s vegetal while still being fairly crisp, with maybe a hint of fresh grass.  No darker, swampy vegetal notes.  Also seems to have a bit of a spearmint in the finish, complete with a light cooling effect.  I’m not getting that standard Desert Ship type of arabian/turkish vegetal note, seems likes a fairly different beast altogether.  I sort of hate that desert ship vegetal note up against any kind of a hint of cocoa or nuttiness, but this seems to be working fairly well.\n\nFull mouthfeel.  Not too dry, but also doesn’t feel damp or too moist.  Aggressively aromatic without those botanicals being too sharp or thin.  Sweetness of the tobacco base plays off the ashy absolute notes and the sharpness of those botanicals to feel pretty well balanced overall.\n\n**Off-Flavors:**  Nothing that feels out of place for a botanical pipe tobacco.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Moderate, but that kind of feels like part of the point.   It’s fairly robust in general.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 5%,  this is punching pretty hard.  Balance isn’t bad here, but feels a bit flat without those sassafras notes really coming through clearly.  Perfectly workable here, but maybe a bit less fun.\n\nAt 10%, this is bold.  Pretty aggressive overall.  Heavy ash, heavy tobacco, heavy botanical accents.  Still balanced, but a lot fuller.\n\nDV, as usual says 20%, but this is plenty intense for me lower than that.  Just based on these tests, I’d probably be around 8-10% solo with this, given my setup and everything.  I’d use it as an accent closer to 3%.  \n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This basically just feels like a fully realized solo flavor to me.  It’s full, pretty intense, and I can’t really think of anything else I want to throw in there except maybe some FA Black Fire for some smoke.  \n\nYou could probably use this an accent with a slightly less intense tobacco that doesn’t have that absolute kind of dirty base.   This would work well for a cigar wrapper effect in those applications.  \n\n**Second Opinions:** [Pink Mule is a reseller for DV, and they have a couple of product reviews up.

Cotton wicks. 30 watts.\n\n**Flavor Notes:** This tastes eerily similar to Hangsen Blueberry, almost like someone took Hangsen Blueberry and added a touch of dark raspberry. This has somewhat of a dense mouthfeel and a mild but not unbearable throat hit. There's a sweet stickiness that seems to be common among artificial dark berry flavors. Obviously, blue raspberry is not just blueberry and raspberry combined, but there's a definite candied blueberry note on the inhale, followed by a dark, one-dimensional raspberry taste on the exhale. The raspberry note seems like it tries to be both tart and juicy, but it falls a bit short in both respects. Even though blue raspberry is mostly considered an artificial flavor, there's somewhat of an authentic berry note lingering around.\n\nThere aren't any off notes, but after vaping this for an extended period of time, a dryness started to creep in, mostly on the inhale. This could easily be remedied by throwing in something like cactus or cucumber. FA Fuji or a lemon would make the berry note pop a lot more and help in lending some tartness. \n\nThis is very much a candy-type flavor that will work best in that type of profile. It'll likely perform well in beverages, too. I can't imagine that this would work well with bakeries, but if you wanted to add a dark sweetness to a berry jam mix, you might be able to squeeze this in somehow (similar to how you'd use FLV Boysenberry).\n\nI'd recommend this at 3-4% solo, and I'd shoot for 1-2% in a mix depending on how present you want it to be.

Up front, there's a strong taste of sweet blueberry skins which is kinda pleasant and unpleasant at the same time. This really leans towards a fresh blueberry fruit rather than a candy or baked blueberry, and it has somewhat of a floral dynamic going on. There's a small amount of fleshy body on the exhale, but overall, this isn't a very heavy flavor. It's sweet without being cloying or artificial- a very naturally sweet fruit flavor. There's a slight bitterness that kind of sticks to the roof of my mouth on the exhale, and it creates this weird medicinal note which is off-putting after a while. There's no tartness to be found.\n\nOverall, I feel like there's a better selection of blueberries out there, but I don't feel like this flavor is a complete dud by any means. If you want a reliable workhorse blueberry flavor, this probably isn't it. However, if you're into florals, you'd enjoy playing around with this. I also think it could work fairly well in beverages. It could add a nice blueberry-flavored touch without altering texture or making things too syrupy and heavy. If you've had RF Blueberry SC, this tastes similar but not as hollow or empty.\n\nThe light flavor is really going to prevent this from being used as a base note. I'd start using this at 1-2% if you wanted to add a blueberry accent, and I'd shoot for around 3-3.5% for a more noticeable blueberry flavor without any off notes. At 4% or higher, you're going to have to battle some bitterness. ",

Works well with a wide variety of flavors.\"*\n\n**Testing Setup:** SXMini Faucon RDTA with a four-wrap SS316L single clapton at 0.35 ohms. Cotton wicks. 30 watts.\n\n**Flavor Notes:** EuroFlavor's description of this concentrate isn't all that accurate. Is there a slight crispness? Eh, more like a sharper creaminess. I wouldn't use the words \"sugar,\" \"honey,\" or \"crumbly\" to describe it either. If it were up to me, I'd call this flavor sweet and spiced with hints of soft graham. Despite the seemingly inaccurate description, this is an incredibly interesting flavor.\n\nWhen I first smelled the bottle, I was instantly reminded of cologne, and I was pretty turned off. There's a fairly strong, spicy, sandalwood scent that reminds me of a grandpa. I fully anticipated this to taste like a mixture of tree bark and cologne. A member from another forum recommended mixing EuroFlavor concentrates anywhere from 3-5%, so my first mix was at 3%.\n\nWhen vaping this, I immediately taste the spice, and there's definitely notes of graham present. It's difficult to pick out every individual spice, but I'm almost positive there's a combination of ginger and what seems to be cardamom. At times I thought I was picking up on clove and a really creamy nutmeg taste, but at other times it didn't seem to be as present. The graham sits more in the background and is very soft, almost like someone soaked pieces of it in heavy cream before adding it in. There's a very faint dark vanilla note that has an FA Vanilla (Madagascar) quality. After a two-week steep, the spiciness calms down, and the graham notes become more noticeable. Instead of spice with hints of graham, it's now more of a creamy graham with spices.\n\nMy next test was at 1% since I wanted to see how this would work as an accent. At this percentage, the graham really isn't that noticeable. On the shake, it's really more of a spicy ginger which turns into a soft spiced cream note after a week-ish steep. At 5%, this is relatively strong and has much more of the cologne vibe that I smelled when getting the concentrate. If you wanted to use this above 4%, it's going to take over the mix. The spices aren't going to be able to be covered up at all, but the graham will be sit more upfront after a long steep. Overall, I'd say this will work best at 0.5-1% as an accent, and I 'd use it around 3% if you wanted to feature it more prominently. Like any other mix, the percentage that you use is going to be dependent on the other flavors. This, however, is probably not going to mesh well with other stronger concentrates.\n\nIf you're looking for a generic, Honey Maid graham cracker, this isn't it. If you wanted to combine it with a drier flavor (like a biscuit), it could be bent in that direction, though. This would be an awesome accent for bakeries in general (pie crusts in particular), tobaccos, and I'd even recommend using it in conjunction with something like black tea for a chai-type mix. Of all the EuroFlavor concentrates I've tried, this is by far my favorite. It's complicated but somewhat versatile, and it could really push mixes into unusual but pleasant directions. If you're into bakeries and spices, I really think you'd benefit from having this in your arsenal. \n\n**Additional Note:** The cardamom note in the concentrate made me feel like this is a flavor that would do a great job in complimenting a citrus, so as a quick test, I mixed INW Shisha Lemon @ 1%, FA Vanilla (Madagascar) @ 1%, and EF Graham Cracker @ 3%. This ended up being pretty tasty! It's got a lemon meringue pie quality that I'll probably build off of at some point in the future, but I've just kinda enjoyed it as is for now.",

Cotton wicks. 30 watts.\n\n**Flavor Notes:** If you're looking for a New York Cheesecake, this ain't it. With a strong bite and almost brash flavor, this is without a doubt a more traditional cheesecake.\n\nAs a SNV, there's an almost overwhelming dark, deep vanilla note that's very reminiscent of a vanilla extract. The flavor isn't far off from the CAP French Vanilla profile in terms of richness. There's a tangy bite that's sticky on the tongue. It's a quick-hitting sharpness that I would expect to be heavy and sour, but it's significantly more sweet and tangy. There's a slight creamy dairy taste but no creamy mouthfeel whatsoever. There's just the slightest hint of what I'd call smokiness. I'm guessing this might be a graham note, but it's weird, and I'm not a fan. On the density spectrum, I'd put it right in the middle- not heavy, not wispy, very meek throat hit. Overall, this tastes like a lot of cheesecake with almost no crust.\n\nAfter a one month steep, the overall flavor softens up tremendously, particularly the vanilla note. The softer, more uniform taste creates a smoother mouthfeel which is more in line of what I'd expect with a cheesecake. In regards to a cheesecake body, there's a stronger sweet cream note that isn't very heavy. The tang is still there, but it's not as bold or obnoxious as before, and it doesn't leave the unpleasant stickiness in my mouth like it did previously. There is no discernible graham/crust note which means 1) it was never there to begin with (and the slight smokiness that I previously tasted was just an off note) or 2) it completely steeps out. It needs some assistance in that area for sure.\n\nThe vanilla remains dark and rich despite softening up, but I can't say the same for the richness of the actual filling. Compared to a NY cheesecake, the body is a lot lighter, and there's a very notable piquant sweetness. The sweetness is more natural than artificial- more of a sweet cream byproduct than an added sugar. There isn't a strong cheesy note which could be both a pro and a con depending on your palate. If someone put a gun to my head and told me I had to pick out a cheese note, I would say this leans in a more mascarpone direction rather than a cream cheese one, but this isn't something that sticks out much.\n\nOverall, this flavor tastes like a crust-less, traditional cheesecake that was just slightly overdone. If you don't like the egginess of CAP Vanilla Custard or the rich vanilla note in CAP French Vanilla, you're not going to enjoy this flavor. I wouldn't say this flavor is eggy by any means, but the creamy dairy note seems to come from the same family as CAP VC, and the vanilla note is very similar to both vanilla profiles.\n\nIf you wanted to use this flavor as your lead in a mix, I'd stick to around 2% or so. Anything over 3% became nauseatingly tangy for me. 0.5%-1% is where I'd start if it were going to be used as an accent.",

After 3 weeks, the spice really comes out and turns a bit thicker, almost like a hint of real molasses.  This flavor has kind of an overall woodsy taste, but isn't \"woody\".  Kind of like walking through a forest during a drought.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Reports of alcohol or perfume at higher percentages.  Personally, I get nothing \"off\" here @3% unless you were expecting \"7 leaves\" to be a green plant with 7 leaves :)\n\n**Throat hit:** 6/10, dry, but still mellow\n\n**Uses:** Decent shake and vape by itself at a lower percentage if you enjoy a bag of Bali Shag rolling tobacco or something like Drum or Top in a can with a subtle sweetness.  Also good as part of a cig tobacco base.\n\n**Pairings:**  Other tobaccos, nuts, AP, maybe a touch of your favorite fruit or cream if you prefer.\n\n**Notes:**   This definitely works well as a shake n vape if you're after something resembling rolling tobacco.

This tastes like a slightly wetter and less strong version of TFA Absinthe.  It has a very smooth yet unmistakable fluffy black licorice taste with a light and slightly creamy mouthfeel.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Nothing completely unexpected, although one could argue it is a bit creamy and sweet.\n\n**Throat hit:** 3/10 pretty mellow and light\n\n**Uses:** Great for adding some body along with a dark star anise sort of flavor.  Has a tendency to \"cool\" recipes at lower percentages.  Maybe try this in place of Koolada for a less menthol sort of approach. Above 1.5% it really starts to come alive.  There are [ramblings of it being fairly linear even above 4%](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/48) which is rather uncharacteristic for an FA flavor.\n\n**Pairings:**   Dark fruits, citrus fruits, chocolate, herbs/spices, caramel, even some mints, and possibly some tobaccos would pair well here.\n\n**Notes:**  This could definitely be a love/hate type of flavor.  If you don't like black licorice, you can probably pass on this.  If you're like me and don't like black licorice but are trying to acquire a taste, this might help bridge that gap with it's forgiving sweet and creamy properties.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FA Apricot @ %2, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 10 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Solo, it's not a very aggressive flavor.  It's actually a bit hard to place, i get a stone-fruit juicy base, some mild spicy peel notes, and a light kind of floral peach candy top note.  Ridiculously versatile mixer though, that fruit flavor slots in just about anywhere you put it, making everything fuller, juicier, and adding just a tiny bit of natural sweetness.\n\nInhale is moderately dense, but lighter in flavor.  Juicy, naturally sweet, base stone fruit flavor in there but it's pretty subtle.  Some lighter floral peach as well. Exhale has a really soft, relatively light kind of yellow peach flavor up front, with some higher peach candy top notes. Juicy mouthfeel. Lightly spicy peel top notes on the back half of the exhale.  Not super floral, but it's definitely there.  Really clean finish, with nothing lingering too long.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Fairly peachy, not unpleasant but not quite on point for a fresh apricot.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light.  It's absolutely nothing compared to a peach flavor though.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  The most literal use of this would be to provide some of the juicy body that more realistic peach flavors tend to lack.  You can take advantage of top-heavy those peach flavors to get a good strong peach flavor, while using this for a less harsh body.  Good base for any of the stone fruits including plums and cherries.\n\nBeyond that, this is stupid versatile. A lowish-percentage of this flavor is almost never going to feel out of place.  Be just a bit judicious in fruit paring watching for the floral top notes and spicy peel here if you're super sensitive to those kind of things.\n\nThis'll mix well with bakeries and creams too, although that juicyness can soften up denser bready flavors.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nS&V Concentration testing, This feels pretty weak at .25 and .5%.  Some sweetness, and a bit of juicyness but no real flavor besides some floral peach top notes. 1% still feels light, but the apricot flavor seems to be filling out a bit.  Decent, but stil a bit flat. 1.5% is starting to get some body and some juiciness. 2% has more of a peachy character, with that juiciness really showing up. 2.5% has those spicy peel notes getting a bit more prominent. And by 3% I feel like the peel is taking over and the entire thing is a bit floral.  I'd recommend using this as backup for other fruit flavors, starting at 1.5% and working up.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[HIC Notes, because why not I guess.](http://mamajsflavorshop.com/headinclouds-my-notes-on-flavor-descriptions/)\n\n\"This is just like a fresh, juicy, perfectly-ripe apricot - excellent, realistic flavor with just the right level of natural sweetness. Apricot blends great with other fruits. Coconut accents it well. Makes excellent apricot brandy (mix with FA Brandy) and apricot rum (mix with FA Jamaican Rum), which can be used for cocktail-type vapes.Super in bakery recipes. To 'bake' the apricot flavor, add a tiny bit of Brandy or Jamaican Rum along with it, and perhaps a touch of Brown Sugar Extra (from The Flavor Apprentice).\"\n\n[Lots of FA Apricot love in here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/3ajfx8/giving_the_apricot_some_well_deserved_love/)\n\n[Couple of downright sensible reviews on ECX.](http://www.ecigexpress.com/diy-e-liquid/browse-flavorings/fruit-flavors/apricot-by-flavourart.html#review-list)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FA Aurora@ .5%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 7 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**\nSweet, slightly carbonated limeade with a lot of realistic lime-zest. Authentically bitter, without crossing into astringent.  Sweet and relatively dense, with a great overall balance.\n\nInhale is moderately dense and sweet. Almost a lime candy, but a bit sour and with some zest bitterness.  Most citrus inhales have a ton of zest, but this has more zest at the top on the exhale. Bitter note is definitely present in the inhale, but it peaks in the exhale which is cool. Almost a limeade flavor underneath that realistic lime zest.  Still fairly sweet in the exhale and dense for a citrus.  Some light effervescence, which is awful pleasant. Lingering lime zest and a sticky-sweet mouthfeel. \n\n**Off-flavors:** Not really, but it's maybe a touch sweeter than you'd expect for something so zest-heavy.\n\n**Throat Hit:**Light, totally manageable for citrus.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This is 95% of the way to a one-shot natural limeade solo.  Maybe a tiny bit of INW Cactus or CAP Cucumber for some juiciness, but the sweetenss, carbonation, and depth of flavor is really impressive.  Adding some dark berries is going to push this into a berry limeade which is great.\n\nI also like this for cocktail vapes. This has the best zest component of any of the limes I've tried so it works well for a lime twist in a cocktail. The efferesvence and sweetness here are kind of a bonus in that application.\n\nThis would also be awesome for a lime candy, adding some realism and zest and making it taste a little less \"green\" and more like actual fruit was involved at some point.\n\nSeems like a natural fit for the top notes on a key lime pie, because if you don't grate like twice the recommended  zest in your lime curd you're doing it wrong.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nStrong stuff, my tester was mixed at .5% and gives me about all I could ask for.  S&V concentration testing, 1 (tiny FA original bottle) drop per 10ml is already noticeable and a nice subltle lime zest. Sweetness and bitterness just ramps from there.  Gets too pushy pretty quickly. Maybe a bit too bitter for me as low as 1%. I'd mix this low, like .2-.3% if you're just after the lime zest note here. For that fizzy limeade flavor, try mixing between .5% and 1%, although at 1% you're going to want to have some extra juiciness going on here and that zest is going to be aggressive.\n\nSo, this stuff is awesome. I try to avoid editorializing that much, but it's a really solid lime flavor. The zest note is close to perfect.  It's bitter without being astringent and it sits perfectly in the exhale. Sweetness is a tiny bit weird, but the effervescence is really nice.  Overall pretty great.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n/u/CheebaSteeba/ and /u/RuntDastardly went over this a bit in the comments for [Runt's Glaistig recipe.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/4ct1mz/goddamnit_you_guys_listen_the_glaistig_a_recipe/)  Cheeba reports on his preliminary tests:\n\n\"I have a lot of experimenting to do but it seems like the best purpose for this is like a nice refreshing lime-y finish to a cocktail. My go-to cocktail is ice, gin, limeade, tonic water; It kind of reminds me of that after all the ice has melted and it's gone flat (if that helps you picture it at all). I still have a lot of messing around to do with it, but it seems like a finish to a cocktail recipe is the obvious place to take it. I mixed this solo at 4% to test it out, and it seemed like a nice spot for it solo. It's definitely a lingerer though, and I feel will still stand out in a recipe at much lower %s (.5-2%).\" \n\nCheeba also talks about quinine, juniper and cucumber that I don't quite pick up, probably because my use percentages are quite a bit lower and my tatse buds are just a bit basic.  The complexity here just reads as realistic lime zest to me.\n\n/u/StardustCoyote/ posted a [Baja Blast recipe](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/4s3zlt/baja_blast/) that doubled as a FA Aurora love letter.  Their notes include:\n\n\"FA Aurora - and this, my friends, is the magic. This gets you a lime fizz flavor on the end of a vape. It's brilliant, and it's quickly becoming a favorite of mine.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FA Bergamot @ .5%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 7 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** It's (mostly) what makes earl grey tea stand out from normal black tea. Definitely not a fruit flavor. More of a spicy musk. Warm, peppery, and lightly sweet, this has just a tiny bit of a creamy orange buried somewhere underneath all that.\n\nInhale is relatively neutral, fairly dense, and smooth with some sour citrus in there. Almost a vanilla note. The exhale kind of blows up into black pepper.  Pronounced warmth there, a lot like clove flavors. Still, denser and fluffier than you'd expect given the black pepper thing.  Nice baseline sweetness, even at .5%. Overall, it's a musky (without really crossing into earthy) spice note on top of a smooth (very lightly) orange-tinged base.  A lot like FA Hypnotic Mist with a less complex base and much stronger spice note.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Admittedly odd vaped solo, but nothing that seems completely out of place?\n\n**Throat Hit:** Moderate when vaped solo.  Not as harsh as it could be, all things considered.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:** Earl grey tea is the obvious play here. Find a concentration that works for your favorite black tea flavor, add .1%-.3% of this and enjoy.  Maybe 1 drop of this, and .5% of hypnotic mist if you want the tea a bit softer and creamier.\n\nThe warming note here is going to be useful for an authentic kind of spice punch to more savory recipes. Would pair well Cardamom or Clove to round that spice flavor out a bit. I'd also suggest vanilla, if you want a spicier note a lot like you'd get from fairly raw specks of vanilla bean as opposed to a finished vanilla extract or flavoring.\n\nWorks well as tobacco additive.  Added a couple drops into a bottle of FLV Native Tobacco and it definitely warms up the mix a bit and gives the flavor a bit of \"hit\" without adding noticeably to the overall throat hit.\n\nThis also shows up in low percentages in cereal vapes, but I'm not 100% sure it works in the way that I thought it did. Instead of adding zest bitterness, it seems to add a dimension to that AP graininess you get from cereal concentrates. As far I can tell there is nothing that actually reads as citrus zest here. It really is just that peppery musky volume.  If someone has more experience with using this in a cereal vape, please tell me I'm wrong.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nStraight black pepper, so use sparingly. This is another start at 1 drop per 30 ml and work up.  You'll notice the effect on other flavors and the warmth before you get a clear pepper taste. There are very few applications that you'd want to go above .5%.  Maybe a very spicy earl grey, or you really want to nail that bear mace profile, brah.  Just for laughs, I tried at 1, 2, and 3% and it's not a great idea.\n\nMore of a flavor enhancer for spice notes, as opposed to anything you'd really want to taste. Interesting stuff.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Seriously, just read this by /u/ilikeycoffee.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/3ntjf6/the_bergamot_orange_hey_man_are_you_sure_this/) It's awesome.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FA Bitter Wizard @ 2% solo, others noted, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 13 days, others noted.\n\n**Flavor Description:** So Flavour Arts website copy reads: \"Balance your juice ! With the Bitter Wizard we are glad to announce another new development, designed to reduce or eliminate the sweet basic taste given by PG or VG.\"  So, I tried doing just that.  My basic test mix is set for 60% VG / 40% PG so there isn't a bunch of sweetness but it's definitely there on the VG.  Almost a light, kind of a light coconut sweetness hiding in with the more astringent PG. Trying that same mix with 2% Bitter Wizard, it doesn't really seem to eliminate the sweetness so much as add some bitter flavor while at the same time drying the vape out a bit.  Overall effect is fairly tannic, like you'd get out of grape skins. Bitter note has a pine rosin type of character, very true bitter.\n\nTrying this out at 1% with straight vg, it's fairly subtle. Not really affecting the volume, but maybe toning the sweetness down a bit while drying out the exhale.  2% brings doesn't really ramp up the bitterness, but it does dry out the vape substantially. I think I know where this is going, but just for laughs... 3% you start to get that bitter note, while the vape itself feels bone dry. 4% makes you question everything and leads inexorably to an existential crisis.  Fun stuff!\n\n**Off-flavors:** If over-used it gets super bitter and dries the actual vape out until it gets all cardboardy.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Nah. Doesn't seem to add any throat hit.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I can see two primary uses for this: tailoring fruit notes and tobaccos.\n\nUseful if you've got a fruit flavor you absolutely love but the texture is reading too juicy and wet. Will let you sort of dry the entire mix out without too much effect on the underlying base flavor. \n\n[2% FA Fig](https://redd.it/5nzjef), 1% Bitter Wizard, S&V: Went from super juicy to tasting an awful lot like grape skins.  Bitterness seems a lot more pronounced with PG in the mix because I'm getting a clear bitter flavor here.\n\n[2% HS Grape](https://redd.it/5m3lg7), .25% Bitter Wizard, S&V: took some underlying grape chewable asprin notes and pushed it all the way in that direction.  Gnarly.\n\n[3% CAP Fig](https://redd.it/5n95qq), 1 drop Bitter Wizard per 10ml, S&V: This is actually doable. Cuts down on some the syrupy character of original concentrate while letting some light green notes pop a bit.\n\n*Perferred application to de-juicify your fruits should like 1 drop per 10ml or .1% (if you can measure it) and work up.  You'll notice when it gets weird.*\n\nTrying this, I immediately thought of champagne concentrates. This always read as oversweet and too fruity for me.\n\n3% FW Pink Champagne, 1 drop Bitter Wizard per 10ml, S&V: Again, pretty solid results. Dries out some of the pinker grape notes and really lets the mineral tang shine through. Doesn't seem to affect the carbonation of the underlying concentrate.\n\n[2% FA Brandy](https://redd.it/4sdt7m), 1 drop Bitter Wizard per 10ml, S&V: So if it works for a too-grapey champagne, what about a too-fruity liquor? Doesn't really play super well. Cuts down on the juicy fruit note but seems to hollow out what little fermentation there is.\n\n*Again, use at super low percentages to dry out a cocktail, keeping in mind that it'll mess with any actual fermentation notes.*\n\nThis works quite a bit better with tobaccos.  Does largely what you'd expect, cuts down inherent sweetness and dries out the exhale quite a bit. \n\n[3% FLV Red Burley](https://redd.it/4rwjwu), .5% FA Bitter Wizard, S&V: Turns FLV Red Burley into smoky roasted nuts.  Maybe not the best application, and a little overboard on percentage.\n\n[3% FLV Native Tobacco](https://redd.it/5dtasm), .25% FA Bitter Wizard, S&V: Kind of buffs up FLV Native Tobacco and gives you a drier, more acrid, cigarette mouthfeel.\n\n[2% FA Black Fire](https://redd.it/5ns9e2), .5% FA Bitter Wizard, S&V: Turns FA Black Fire into more of an actual structure fire. I think Flavour Art's suggested percentage of 1% is way overkill in general. \n\n*Seems like the best results for tobacco are at about .25%, where you're enhancing character without completely drying your mouth out.*\n\nJust for laughs, again, I added this at about .25% to FA Cookie at 2%.  Don't do this. It's weird, even for someone who vaped Bitter Wizard at 4%. Does not play well with any kind of richer notes and drastically drys out the texture. Like pulverizing a burnt cookie and inhaling the crumbs.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nSo, TL:DR version of the usage:\n\nTiny amount (1 or 2 drops per 30ml) to take some juicyness out of a fruit.\n\nTiny amount (1 or 2 drops per 30ml) to give your cocktails a dryer edge.\n\n.25% to make your tobaccos sharper and roastier.\n\nKeep this the hell away from creams, custards, and bakeries.\n\nSeems pretty inessential unless you want to hardcore mess with tobaccos.  Also reported to noticeably mute flavors within a week, so use at your own peril.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[ELR Notes are pretty useless, except for this by user \"docta\" posted:](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/242) \n\n\"Used in Gatorade and some colas to give a bitter note. At 0.5%, masks the flavor of vg and pg, thus only leaving the taste of your flavor mix. 1% or higher, gives the pleasant bitter ring of colas, whiskeys, or dark chocolate.\"\n\nKnee-jerk reaction, I'm going to disagree, mainly because that doesn't account for the really significant changes to mouthfeel I'm getting.\n\nThey also quote a review from BCF in the same note saying that:\n\n\" This is a must have for candy recipes that need that bitter on the tongue effect. Example: pixy stix, sweet tarts, runts, lemon heads, etc... 1 to 2 drops per 10ml seem to do the trick. must have. I use this in over half of my recipes now. It makes the flavors POP This magic liquid solves my problem of always sweet VG ruining a great flavor, especially tobacco flavors. This takes the unwanted \"sweet taste\" off the top of my tongue. About 8 drops in a 60 ml bottle does the trick. Sweet taste has its place, but when you don't want it, use Bitter Wizard.\"\n\nThis'll definitely make a candy mix chalky and dry, so if that's what you're going for, have fun.\n\n[Reports of flavor muting on the sub.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/2cgltl/any_experience_with_bitter_wizard/)\n\n[Quick overview of additives on ECF. Bitter Wizard descriptions is as follows:](https://www.e-cigarette-forum.com/forum/blog-entry/what-else-do-i-need-diy-mixing-staples-and-misc-for-blending-flavors.2380/)\n\n\"This makes things bitter. Mostly useful for tobacco blends, but sometimes a bit of bitter will make things much more flavorful. Again 1 drop per 10ml to 1 drop per 2ml is a useful range. I usually start at the tiny 1 drop per 10ml and work up if it is needed.\"\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

This is a deep, full, complex, rich blackberry flavor. It is not especially sweet, not like pie filling. The background flavor is musky, like wild blackberries. If it tastes like soap or perfume to you, you are using too much. Consider making a 10% dilution to use as your flavoring - this makes it easy to use very small amounts.Fresh Cream is excellent to lighten the flavor, and plenty of other, sweeter flavors in a recipe will give the best results.

Great to sweeten other strong, dark fruits and berries, like Bilberry, Pomegranate, and Blackcurrant.Makes excellent cherry brandy (add a touch of FA's Brandy) or cherry rum (mix with FA Jamaican Rum) to use in cocktail recipes.For baked fruit flavor in bakery mixes, try adding a touch of Brandy or Jamaican Rum along with it.Combines great with FA Almond for a bold cherry-almond addition to any recipe.If you're looking to make a cherry tobacco, Black Cherry is probably the one you want (as opposed to Cherry).For light, subtle, or background cherry flavor, you might prefer FA Cherry.

Deep sweetness, with a lingering gummy mouthfeel.\n\nInhale is syrupy sweet. Dark marionberry/boysenberry type of flavor that isn't quite a blackberry but definitely isn't a raspberry.  Good volume without feeling too creamy or dense.  Exhale has that same dark berry note but with some really interesting tarter top notes.  Not green or tannic like you'd expect from a small berry with so much surface area, but a true tart kind of apple cider vinegar note. Tartness isn't distracting and well balanced enough, but definitely tart. Sweet throughout the exhale with that same fluffy mouthfeel. Sweetness builds and the overall mouthfeel ends up being pretty much a gummy kind of flavor. Exhale is mostly clean, but that gummy mouthfeel lingers and coats the palate.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  That tartness is a bit weird, but in a good way. I can't really place a concentrate with the same kind of tartness to it.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Not much, tiny bit of the harshness on the exhale but nothing out of line.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  You know what this kind of tastes like at 2%? A cross between swedish fish and a dash of ketchup. Wikipedia says that the flavor of swedish fish is rumored to be lingonberry, so we aren't too far out of the ballpark. You could run with that, and give your swedish fish vape an edge by staying the hell away from TFA's swedish gummy flavor. Quick S&V mix of 2% Blackcurrant and 3% CAP Jelly Candy, and it's pretty close if a bit dark. Should work well with all of your normal candy texturizers, and that tart note does a good job of replicating that brighter acid hit you get in hard candies or gummies.\n\nUsed in a lot of fruit mixes to add tart top notes, sweetness, and darker depth. Good complement for darker berries and a good counterpoint for brighter fruits.\n\nGood stand-in for that lingonberry swedish berry type of flavor you get with a lot of crepes and stuff.  Little syrupy for any drier bakeries, but should work well in a recipe that calls for more of a syrup on top.\n\nLower percentages should work well with whipped creams and heavier custards that already have a lot of body.  I can see this being used to back up blueberries or blackberries.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nS&V concentration testing, 1% and under is mostly just tart.  Not a whole lot of fruit going on.  1.5% is still a little floral and tart. 2% is better, and seems to give me most of what I need from the flavor. 3% has a deeper sweetness and fuller berry flavor. Gets awful ketchup-y for me with that tart note at 4%.  I'd use this at 1% for an additive for other dark berries, 2% as a subtle primary note or strong accent for fruits or creams/custards, and 3% as a dominant note in fruit mixes or candies.\n\nAnother flavor where I don't have much actual reference so I can't comment too much on realism.  Seems too syrupy for a dead-on take on a real fruit, so probably more of a candy take.  [/u/queutetue/ , of course, apparently grows the damn things and this doesn't taste much like the real fruit (but apparently that's not a bad thing.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/41qyvm/looking_for_a_very_strong_natural_blackcurrant/cz4y4ho/)  More than willing to defer here.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FA Black Jack Vintage @ 1 and 2.5%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 14 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  This is one of the Flavourart UK blends that I picked up from Chef's. I think these are pretty much designed as one-shots.  This one is supposed to be based on these [UK Black Jack candies,](https://www.treasureislandsweets.co.uk/soft-liquorice/black-jack-chews.html) but to my sad, sad american palate it seems really close to [Black Jack Gum](http://www.candywarehouse.com/products/black-jack-gum-5-stick-packs-20-piece-box/).  According to the wikipedia, Black Jack Gum is also an aniseed flavor so maybe it's similar? Anyway, kind of tastes like FA Black Touch turned into a gum.  Warm, more herbal licorice root flavor than a sharper anise. Tastes closer to black licorice, or at the natural kind of licorice from FA Black Touch, than it does some really anise heavy flavor like absinthe.  Dry at the front, but leaves a pretty noticeable gelatin-based candy stickiness on your palate at the end.  Some weird chest tightness, especially above 2%. Seems to be fairly strong, I'd recommend use at .5% for an accent or 1% for a primary flavor or solo with a bit of cooling.\n\nInhale is mostly dry licorice root. Kind of hard to tell where licorice ends and anise begins, but this has more of a herbal note that I associate with good licorice than sharper anise. Medium sweet, but a little hard to take full inhales.  I'm thinking it's something beyond the dryness.  Exhale has more of that herbal licorice right up front. Actually seems to be crossing into a horehound flavor a bit. Some higher, sort of easy to miss anise top notes. Front of the exhale also has a pretty tangible chalky texture, and maybe even a bit of powdery taste to it. Tail end of the exhale still has quite a bit of that black touch ish licorice, but there is a clearer anise flavor back there. Texture gets interesting quick, as it bounces from that powdery texture up front to a really sticky finish, leaving almost a gelatinous mouthfeel... on top of that dry texture. It's weird, and a bit hard to vape. Doesn't taste bad though.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  I haven't had the inspiration for the flavor, so it's hard to say. If the aniseed from the black jack candies tastes like the aniseed from the black jack gum, then it's pretty similar.  It's odd for a flavor to have both a chalky dryness and a gummy mouthfeel at the end, so that probably counts.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Not too much traditional throat hit, but this is wreaking some havoc on my chest. I don't know if it's the dryness or maybe just one of the volatiles in here, but it's physically a bit hard for me to vape at 2% and above.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  A little bit of cooling goes a long way to cleaning up this flavor. Before I did a SFT, I was using this at 2% with a couple drops of FLV Cool Menthol per 30 ml and it was making a world of difference. The cooling really does seem to thin this out and let you enjoy more of the flavor without running into that weird chest tightness or sticky mouthfeel at the end.  With that little bit of cooling, it's spot on for blackjack gum. \n\nYou could probably accent around this to bring in some of the heavier aniseed flavor it seems like it may or may not be missing. Should take a bit of Absinthe (go full euro with your [DV Absinthe](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/5snr4p/dv_absinthe)) pretty well. I'd stay away from a straight anise concentrate, as those tend to be more of a bakery rather than candy anise note.\n\nAdditionally, this could be interesting swapping this out for FA black touch in a licorice recipe that needs some extra body. I also think it would be a great base to build a licorice candy around, especially one using sweet dark berries like FA Blackcurrant.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, this is still pretty potent despite the \"blend\" status. It's present at .25 but weak. Pretty much the same thing at .5%, but you're getting some of the very black touch-esque licorice note and some sharper anise.  Still a bit undersweet, but could probably be used as an accent this low. By 1% I'm getting a lot of what I want out of the flavor. Herbal licorice, lighter anise towards the end. Pretty dry though, especially up front. I'm getting a jelly candy stickiness after that chalky gum note up front. It's a little odd. 1.5% doesn't really seem to improve much, just a bit dryer and sweeter. Licorice is getting more prominent, anise is kind of fading into the background. 2% is even more of the same, dryer, heavy on the licorice. Getting a bit hard to vape this high. 2.5% isn't unvapeable, but I'm not really enjoying it and it seems to cross over into some chest tightness.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[5 out of 7 reviews for this on vapeable.com are 5 stars. A couple of users say it tastes just like the Black Jack candies. Both of the negative reviews complain about a lack of aniseed flavor.](http://vapable.com/product/black-jack-flavour-art-concentrate-10ml/)\n\n[Couple of notes on ELR. User \"martyndance\" says: \" Bit too overpowering even at 1%.\"  User \"chewy\" says: \"Very true to the Black Jack taste!\"](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/17455)\n\n[Here's the product page from Flavourart UK. It's for all their blended flavors, but there is an actual description buried on there: \"Black Jack Vintage was inspired by my memories of being able to buy sweets called Black Jacks four for a penny, an old, pre-decimal penny in the 1960s! The unmistakeable dark aniseed taste, enhanced with a couple of other background flavours, is reproduced as an eliquid you can vape and savour. One definite advantage of vaping Black Jack is that it will not turn your tongue black as the sweets used to! Nowadays the sweets just turn it grey. In today's currency, one 1960s Black Jack would cost just 0.1042 pence, ah nostalgia isn't what it used to be!\"](http://www.flavourart.co.uk/blended-flavourings-10ml.html)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Wintergreen cooling in there with quite a bit of chalk. Pretty accurate to the profile.\n\nInhale is dense, chalky and soft. That juicy fruit flavor is present, but a tiny bit sour as it builds.  Beginning of the exhale has a stronger, but still relatively soft, juicy fruit flavor. Wintergreen cooling shows up on the back half of the exhale and becomes the primary note on the tail end as that juicy fruit gets really thin and a bit sour. Mouthfeel on the exhale is still fairly chalky and thick, with a muted candy-like sweetness. Sweetness overall is fairly restrained,\n\n**Off-flavors:** Noticeable wintergreen altoid / lifesaver kind of flavor. It's suprisingly accurate to the actual gum though.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light but inconsistent. I could swear this is completely smooth, and then I get a bit of a random harshness. Probably the cooling in here.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:** Strangely satisfying as a single flavor. Pretty well balanced and complicated enough that you're not getting bored right off the jump.  /u/SirSmokesALot suggests adding some TFA Dragonfruit, and yeah I can totally see that. Adding some Dragonfruit to my S&V test, and it definitely works to bump up the fruit flavor without destroying the mouthfeel.\n\nSort of going off that though, I had some of /u/ID10-T/ 's Mother of Dragon's Milk laying around and yeah, this stuff works pretty well there.  Probably heresy, but it's a fairly convincing juicy-fruit cream, if that's your thing for some reason.\n\nBeyond that, you're pretty much on your own. Most of the recipes I found play pretty close to that Juicy Fruit profile. I think there is some value in using this for the mouthfeel and texture.  You're going to have get past that vague generalized candy fruit note and the wintergreen, but at lower percentages this does have quite a bit of that texture without having either of those flavors be too distinctive.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nS&V Concentration testing, mostly just mouthfeel at 1%. Distinctly thick and chalky, with a kind of sour \"what the hell is that\" quality to the juicy fruit flavor. Clear juicy fruit at 2%, but still kind of mild overall. Texture is pretty substantial here and that wintergreen is pretty obvious.  At 3%, the juicy fruit flavor doesn't really get any sharper or more defined, but there is certainly more of it.  It's a fairly dense flavor, but not really all that fleshed out. Wintergreen gets pretty heavy here, and the chalk gets a little weird. I think, at 4% and above, you'd be able to say it's more of a wintergreen lifesaver flavor with an odd touch of juicy fruit.  I'd shamelessly steal the afforementioned tip from /u/SirSmokesALot and mix this as a juicy-fruit gum at 3% with .5% TFA Dragonfruit with a bit of a steep to let it homogenize and keep the dragonfruit in the mix and not on top of it. If you're mixing and just after the texture I'd go for 1.5%.\n\nI picked this up for an earlier version of THE shurb clone.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FA Blood Orange (Red) @ .5% and 1.5%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 10 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Relatively bright and sweet citrus, no real chalkiness or waxyness.  Closer to a realistic tangerine flavor, then a blood orange. I'd venture to say that this is what most people want when they say an \"orange\" flavor. Maybe a bit misleadingly named, because I don't get much of the depth I associate with blood oranges.  I'm not a huge fan of [FA Mandarin](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/5turda/fa_mandarin/), this seems to be a closer to what I'd want from a tangerine vape.  I'd recommend using this at .5-1% for an accent flavor, and 2.0-2.5% as a primary flavor.  \n\nAlso worth nothing that this concentrate has some crazy separation.  You should be shaking all of your concentrates before use, but this looks like the grease from a pepperoni pizza floating on top of a base. No problem in the finished mixes or anything, but I figured I'd put that out there.\n\nInhale has some pretty subdued orange zest notes. Relatively airy with a building canned mandarin type of sweetness.  Exhale is sweet and syrupy mandarin.  Not a lot of tart top notes, but that same kind of hint of zest.  Moderately dense overall, but no real warm and waxy body you get with some other citrus flavors.  No chalkiness like you get from CAP Sweet Tangerine. Lingering zest and a pretty heavy sugary stickiness.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Not really a blood orange, but nothing out of place for an orange bordering on tangerine flavor.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Moderate. Quite a bit smoother than FA Mandarin, but on par with FW Blood Orange.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Good option for an \"orange\" that isn't overtly candy, but not too acidic and realistic.  An orange for all seasons, if you will.\n\nFor that full orange experience, this seems to be exactly what FA Royal Orange is missing in terms of a strong base flavor. The body and acidity from Royal Orange, with the orange flavor from FA Blood Orange, is going to be pretty close to an ideal orange vape.\n\nGood for fruit mixes with brighter fruits like Strawberry and Pineapple.\n\nGood orange for mixing with creams, really suited for a creamsicle type of vape as demonstrated by Wayne in his [\"Blood'sicle\"](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/42952#blood_sicle_flavorbook_entry_recipe_by_enyawreklaw) demo recipe from the flavorbook.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nConcentration testing, this is pretty linear.  .25% is lighter, and heavy on the zest.  Not a lot of sweetness, more like the orange from a flavored seltzer water.  .5% actually brings in noticeably more sweetness than .25%. Still lighter overall, but balance is pretty solid.  1% is still really well balanced. Sweetness and those zest notes is pretty cohesive.  1.5% is pushing sweeter, and getting a bit syrupy. 2% is still pretty bright, but that sweetness is starting to take over a bit. Not necessarily good for the realism here, but really nice overall. 2.5% is about my limit. It's definitely pushing into tangerines in \"light syrup.\"  3% is getting a bit weird and heavy, with the subtler parts of the citrus getting lost in all that sweetness. I'd recommend using this as a light accent down at .5%, 1.0-1.5% as a primary flavor where you have something else going on in the vape, and up to 2.5% when your really want that sweet citrus to be the star of the show.\n\nComparing this FW Blood Orange, I think the FA is going to be a little easier to mix with. FA is a bit brighter and sweeter, closer to a tangerine than the darker, earthier FW.  FW Blood Orange is closer to an actual blood orange, with more depth.  Harshness level seems to be pretty much on par.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nWayne from DIYorDIE has a review up in his flavorbook.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FA Bountiful @ 1 and 2.5%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 15 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Another Flavourart UK blend that I picked up from Chef's. This is supposed to be milk chocolate and coconut candy bar, so my mind goes straight to a [Mounds Bar.](https://www.thehersheycompany.com/en_us/products/product/mounds-candy-bars-1-point-75-ounce.html)  This doesn't really taste like a mounds bar so much as dried, sweetened coconut tossed in (an admittedly better than straight hershey's) chocolate syrup.  I think expecting something that pulls off a perfect candy bar is probably a little bit of wishful thinking, but this feels like the balance is way off and I'm not sure exactly what I'd add to layer this to get that elusive candy bar texture. Coconut note isn't straight suntan lotion, but it does seem to have some coconut candy artificial taste to it. The chocolate needs something, whether it's a bit more wax to pull off a cheap candy bar coating or maybe a bit more grain and body.  I'd probably use this as a component in a bakery where you want some chocolate and coconut, or even better this seems like it would go really well with desert tobaccos, especially something that already has a bit of a chocolate note like FLV Red Burley. I'd use around 2%.\n\nInhale is pretty coconut heavy, lighter chocolate top notes. Sweeter, slightly fruity artificial coconut base with a non cloying level of sweetness. More of a chocolate aroma to it, then a tangible chocolate component to the mix. Moderately dense, with a bit a harshness. Exhale is fairly similar to the exhale. Sort of a chocolate scented dried coconut flakes. I get a little bit of the richness that I'd want from the chocolate, and it manages to avoid coming across like a tootsie-roll. More chocolate syrup than anything else. Coconut has a pretty pleasant level of artificial going on, in addition to the more realistic dry coconut flake. Relatively clean finish overall, some lingering chocolate notes and a bit of harshness.\n\nFWIW, no real coil or wick devastation from the chocolate here. Seems relatively clean.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  I feel like the flavor components are all here and pretty acceptable given how weird chocolate and coconut flavors are. If there is something off, it's more in the coconut heavy balance and sort of wonky texture if you want a candy bar.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Moderate, throughout the entire vape. Not killer, but not quite as smooth as I'd like for something involving a milk chocolate.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I have no earthly clue to make an actual candy bar vape. I can cram the right-ish flavors in there, but how to work in the right texture mystifies me. With this, some AP would help give some definition to the chocolate but it would dry out the coconut in there even further. Alternatively, you could get some wax and richness in there with TPA Vanilla Bean Gelato, but it would push the suntan lotion thing that coconut can do.  I don't know, more power to you if candy bars are your thing, but I remain fairly skeptical that a satisfying chocolate coating and a filling can really be pulled off at the same time.\n\nI think this would be a pretty good ingredient in a bakery that somehow involves both coconut and chocolate. A bakery with some AP will help to boost that chocolate, and with the drier bakery expectation the coconut could probably be managed.\n\nReally, I just want to mix this with tobacco. I could see the RY4 / Soho / Tatanka route, but I've got a tester of this and FLV Red Burley and it's pretty awesome. The cocoa notes from the burley are boosted a bit by the chocolate and the coconut actually works surprisingly well.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, this feels pretty disjointed and missing the chocolate entirely at 1% and under. It's a relatively light flavor, but it's a light version of eating coconut flakes while smelling chocolate. At 1.5%, the chocolate is a little more present. Still not a full chocolate flavor, but it's recognizable enough and adds some interest to that coconut.  2% is my sweet spot, a little harsh but the chocolate seems about as good as it's going to get. 2.5% has that coconut getting a bit more artificial and harsh. 3% is kind of a mess, chocolate doesn't really blend well with how harsh and sweet that coconut is at this percentage.\n\nAlso, on a surreal note, I was vaping this when I passed a highway exit sign for Bountiful, Utah today. Life is weird.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nNothing useful I can find.\n\n[Here's the product page from Flavourart UK. It's for all their blended flavors, but there is an actual description buried on there: \"Bountiful is for those who enjoy the pure pleasure of vaping seductive flavours. Rich and creamy milk chocolate is the perfect background for the tropical coconut taste that is probably the nearest you'll get to eating a bar of chocolate with a coconut centre.

Surprisingly dense, similar to a light cream, not overly thick.  I would say it is definitely a bit creamy with faint notes of apple or maybe white grape?\n\n**Off-flavors:** Sharp and alcohol-like initially, but really smooths out after a steep.\n\n**Throat hit:** 4/10 (after 1 week steep)\n\n**Uses:**  A candied or baked accent to fruits @0.5-2%.  Works well in sprucing up bakeries and desserts.\n\n**Pairings:**  Your favorite fruits. Also, custards, creams, brown sugar, cinnamon. \n\n**Notes:**   I've been putting off this review because I don't know exactly how to describe the flavor, as it isn't really a full on boozy \"brandy\" taste, and I can't really identify the fruit(s) because they are extremely light.  The creaminess also confused me.  I've dripped almost 10mL of this in the past week and am still kind of unsure how this got named \"FA Brandy\", as I was hoping for it to steep into a more defined taste.  I am hoping others can add to it below.  Anyone tried this standalone at 4-5% or under 1%?\n\nEDIT: I want to note that some individuals at ELR state that this can be used in place of FA Liquid Amber.  I do not believe this to be true, as the Liquid Amber carries a lot more of a fermented fruit and tart taste without seeming remotely creamy.\n\nEDIT 2: [Link to all of our flavor reviews in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Flavourart Breakfast Cereals, 1.5% and 3%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 38 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Cerealish, but I'll be damned if I can figure out exactly what kind.\n\n[Flavourart calls this \"the flavour of chocolate milk combined with red fruits and hazelnuts.\"](https://flavourart.com/en/store/flavors/emotions/breakfast-cereals-flavor/)  Luckily, I get basically none or all of those things depending on when I pick this up.\n\nThe primary flavor seems to be a dry cereal grain.  Probably not corn, and not quite as dark as bran.  So oats? Rice?  More of a generic slightly malty cereal taste.  Somewhere between cheerios and life cereal.  Dry, without that promised milky effect.  No harder AP crunch to this.\n\nIt is definitely sweet though.  Sweetness is all over the place.  I get a moderate honey-ish sweetness on the inhale and more of a dry meringue type powdered sugar on the exhale.  Doesn't really feel \"frosted\" so much as just sweet.\n\nMaybe FA is just screwing with us with that description, but I can maybe see the chocolate and hazelnut thing.  If it's there, it's subtle.  I occasionally get a dry kind of nutella chocolate underlying that dry grain flavor.  It almost has a chocolate glazed donut flavor that sneaks in occasionally.  At very high percentages there is something lightly fruity in here but I'd hesitate to pin it too specifically to a single \"red fruit.\"  Mostly shows up in the middle of the exhale. Maybe tastes like there were some dried strawberries involved in here at some point.\n\nEither I'm completely broken, or this flavor is all over the place.\n\n**Off-Flavors:**  There's a whole lot going on here, but nothing that tastes unpleasant.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Not really.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  This flavor seems to vary wildly based on percentage used.\n\nAt 1.5%, I get a pretty solid grain out of this.  Again, sort of nondescript.  Doesn't taste like corn, doesn't go as dark as bran.  Fairly sweet.  There's something about the sweetness and the grain that really reminds me of a glazed donut type of flavor.  Very light on whatever accents of whatever else is going on here.\n\nAt 3%, grain doesn't feel all that much prominent but it seems to be getting drier and picking up more of a flat wheat character. The sweetness has also picked up quite a bit but feels less like a honey and more like straight white sugar.  Fruitiness seems to hit harder at 3% then either higher or lower.  Light, dryish strawberry in the top notes.  Just a bit of that weird chocolate base.\n\nStill not sure what was going on here, I mixed this up at a vaguely absurd 5%... and it's not awful.  I've only got a couple days of steeping on this sample, so YMMV.  That grain note picks up quite a bit and starts to taste like shredded wheat.  It's up this high where the base really gets that nutella chocolate kind of twinge to it.\n\nSo, just based on these tests, I'd be using this on the lower side for that sweet ceral note.  I'd probably be between 1-2% if you're not looking to boost up a chocolate paired with it.  I'd take it up to 4% if those weirder chocolate and strawberry notes work with your profile and you're going to be moistening this somehow.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Whatever's going on here, the cereal grain in this is definitely the primary flavor.[Looking at the recipes on ATF using this flavor](https://alltheflavors.com/flavors/flavourart-breakfast-cereals) you've got in used as the grain in a pie crust, a generic cereal grain, and part of the coating for a fried ice cream.  Seems like a pretty good use for this.\n\nThe more I vape this, the more I'm convinced there is some kind of chocolate in here.  Could make a decent base for a chocolate cereal with some additional chocolate.  Seems more like cocoa pebbles than cocoa puffs, but you could probably mess around with that grain note a bit to fit into whatever chocolate cereal shaped vessel you choose.\n\nAt lower percentages, the sweetness really does come across like a glazed donut.  I could see backing this up some zeppola for a glazed donut base that doesn't taste like play-dough.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  This is probably more straight-forward than I'm assuming, based on the second opinions here.\n\n[Jennifer Jarvis has a pretty complete breakdown up on her FlavorPro site.](http://flavor-pro.com/flavor-notes-flavourart-breakfast-cereals/)\n\n[Here's the ELR Page.  User \"juice junkie\" has a percentage breakdown up, some selected excerpts: \"0.5% A really light grainy note. Nice grainy flavor but a bit light. No off notes... 2% This reminds me of the flakes in Honey Bunches of Oats Cereal. Its grainy, a little sweet, and has some wheat notes to it. The only off note I get from this is that I feel like I taste peanuts a little at this percentage.\"  User \"TwinsWin\" also tastes chocolate, so maybe I'm not nuts: \"I tested it at 4%. The flavor I got reminded me of cream of wheat or even coco wheats. But its almost malty like malted milk with a little chocolate. This flavor wants to be made into a Whoppers vape.\"](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/208852)\n\n[BCF has a couple of fairly comprehensive 5-stars up on their product page.  User \"Amber\" writes: \"It is a grainy, oat cereal with a smidgen of honey, but also has a very distinctive malt taste as well. It's not an overwhelming malt, but more of a milky, soft malty flavor that seems to lift dairy and cream flavors within a recipe. I personally like this with mellow, sweet tobacco flavors, it adds a really unique crunchy flavor. If you like cereal flavors, it is certainly worth trying. Superb flavor!\"  User \"Jennifer Harman\" writes: \"This flavor is a superb Oat Cereal. It's Oats, with maybe a smidge of faint honey and nuts (or another grain) in the back round.

Tastes quite a bit like caramel without having anything approaching the kind of mouthfeel you'd expect.  Overall a bit thin and sharp, almost approaching unpleasant solo. Definitely a caramel for mixing as opposed to a primary note.\n\nInhale is sweet, almost raw sugar.  Mouthfeel is a bit thin for the actual taste.  Strange kind of gritty vibe fitting with the raw sugar thing.  Caramel comes out in the exhale.  Sugar is moderately caramelized with no real dark, burnt notes.  Mouthfeel never really gets smooth, still fairly thin.  Really light creamy notes, almost a margarine type of taste in the middle of the exhale.  Raw sugar comes back on the tail-end of the exhale with some gritty exhale that lingers.\n\n**Off-flavors:** A handful of raw sugar that somehow managed to get caramelized without turning into a syrup.  So the entire thing? Not bad, just not really a smooth caramel flavor.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Moderate.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**\nLower percentage use is basically going to be a sweetener. Creams, custards, darker fruits, nuts, tobaccos.  It's too dark of a flavor to blend well with anything particularly bright and you're really going to want to have some cream or density to round the edges and grittiness off.\n\nIf you start increasing percentages, you move into more of a candy caramel flavor if not texture.  This concentrate has a tendency to sit on top of other flavors when used a bit higher. [Casino Pier](http://diyordievaping.com/2015/08/06/casino-pier/) by /u/enyawreklaw/ uses it up at 3% with a whole lot of cream backup to get a caramel coating on an apple.  Would also work well for a caramel sauce with something to clean up that mouthfeel.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nS&V Concentration testing, this is a warm carmelized type flavor at .5% percent. Sweetness is a bit muted, and the flavor is pretty indistinct, but the effect is nice. 1% starts to get you into that gritty mouthfeel along with a pronounced sweetness. 1.5% has even more grit, and by the time you hit 2% you're definitely going to need something dense or creamy to chill this out a bit. 3% gets pretty intense, with a good caramel flavor but the mouthfeel is pretty distracting. Just seems to dry out after that, with that raw sugar taking on an aggressive sugar-alcohol sweetener note.  I'd mix at .5% for a subtle boost to darker flavors. 1% is probably the max you'd want as strictly a sweetener.  The use as an actual caramel is going to depend on heavy and creamy your actual recipe is. 2% seems like a good starting point, and then work up seeing just how much of the weird mouthfeel issues your cream base can handle.\n\nWorth noting, I didn't get any real noticeable coil gore solo testing this.\n\nSimilar in construction to FLV Caramel, but a lot less roasted. Good middle of the road sweetener, but it's going to need a lot of help with creams to get a smooth caramel.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Obligatory HIC notes:](http://mamajsflavorshop.com/headinclouds-my-notes-on-flavor-descriptions/)\n\n\"More like caramel ice-cream topping than a hard-candy flavor. It never tastes burnt or cracker-jacks-like. It is sweet, but less sweet than other brands.It will add rich caramel flavor to tobaccos without transforming the mix into a candy flavor.Mix FA Caramel with FA Butterscotch (and perhaps sweet, creamy flavors) for a candy-like caramel.\n\nAdding nut flavors can produce buttery effects as a mix ages.\"\n\n[Used in a metric fuckton (technical term) of ELR Recipes.

Flavor is like a cross between ginger, lemon peel, pink peppercorns, sage, and eucalyptus. Warm and thin overall, with a citrus-like tartness. No real extra sweetness here. True to profile, if a bit too herbal.\n\nInhale is sour, gingery lemon peel.  Exhale opens up into a really clear green cardamom. Gingery spice with some fruity pink peppercorn notes.  Almost a juicy lemon in there as well. Back half of the exhale turns green. I get something dark and herby like sage, and a eucalyptus back end.  Thin mouthfeel, and that spice note is definitely on the warm side. Tastes like the spice note is cooked, but there is some actual raw plant in there as well.  Really interesting how much this stuff shifts around depending on where you are in the vape.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  A bit more vegetal than the spice itself.  That leafy eucalyptus throws me a bit.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Light, but completely expected from something this assertive. It may be a feature, and not a bug.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:** Works well with more than you'd think.\n\nTraditional use in chai tea, and blends really well with lighter creams in general.  I've had a cardamom lassi and it was delicious, but I'm not fan of yogurt concentrates so YMMV when it comes to the vapeable form.\n\nIn terms of fruit pairings, I'd stick with smoother, creamier fruits like bananas, coconut, or guanabana/cherimoya. You see some culinary use with mango or papaya, but you'd need a cream to smooth it out in vape form.  Also tends to pair well with squash, but your options are pretty limited there.\n\nUsed in a lot Mediterranean deserts.  Good all-around bakery spice, with a lot of the positive qualities of ginger and clove, without being nearly as sharp.  Would be a great addition to a baklava or a spice cake. Blends well some of those stereotypically Persian flavors like pistachio, almond, rose, and honey.  It's also apparently a thing in Scandinavian baking, so have at it if you want to go full IKEA and get you some cardamom yeast rolls or something.  [/u/Queuetue/ 's Dumbo Ears is an awesome way to get into cardamom pastries.](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/9118#dumbo_ears_by_queuetue)\n\n**Notes:**  Very strong, and super distinctive. This is again one where you want to start very low and work up. Legitimately a 1 drop per 10ml flavor for a lot of applications. You get something like a gingery rose down low. Increasing your percentage, the spice note ramps considerably and that rose sharpens allowing you to pick out of some of the other nuances in there. It tastes a bit more vegetal and herbaceous to me at .25%.  Noticeably tart as well. .5% gets you closer to a dry spice note and that warm, bordering on ginger spiciness.  I'd mix this into something floral really low, at around 2 drops per 10 ml or .05%.  I'd start at .2% for a coconuts or creams, while .5% seems like a good fit for heavier chais or baked goods.  I can't imagine having a use for this over 1%.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[HIC's notes:](http://mamajsflavorshop.com/headinclouds-my-notes-on-flavor-descriptions/)\n\n\"No other company makes this spice flavor, and FA did it perfectly! This tastes just like sweet green cardamom powder (not black cardamom), a sweet spice related to ginger. It's the distinctive flavor in real Indian chai. If you vape coconut, fruit flavors, chai/tea, or spiced bakery recipes, you need this flavor.Cardamom adds a great touch to many fruits. If you use coconut in any recipe, try it with Cardamom. They are a perfect pair; cardamom sweetens the flavor of FA Coconut, especially noticeable when you exhale. Of course you need Cardamom for authentic flavor in chai. It's also used in many Indian desserts and Scandinavian cookies.Addd 0.25-0.5% Cardamom to a recipe for an exotic, sweet-spice touch. If you really can't stand ginger, you should probably avoid Cardamom - but otherwise, give it a try\"\n\nRemember that thing with the potential Cherimoya pairing? [I stole that from /u/CheebaSteeba. He left a recipe in his review for INW Cherimoya that uses cardamom:](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/47c3tg/flavor_review_recipe_inw_cherimoya/)\n\n\"Cardamom: This flavor makes the Rabri. It brings this slightly sweet, spicy tone to the party and really brightens up the Cherimoya and makes him the star. Without it, this flavor is really hard for me to work in to a recipe. You can take this lower, prob .25% if you don't like it as spicy, and I wouldn't bring it higher than .5% or it will take over.\" Worth noting, the final percentage is .125%.\n\n[/u/HocusKrokus provides another spot-on quick rundown in the FOTW Spice post:](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/56xf9q/lets_spice_up_fotw_this_weeks_flavor_of_the_week/)\n\n\"FA Cardamom: Very authentic and true to it's name. It can make a home anywhere where cinnamon or ginger could fit as well. A great addition to holiday themed recipes, spiced teas, or just zesting up some bright berries. Best results at .5% or less IMO, but can still be good up to 1% if it's competing with some heavier flavors.\"\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Milky texture. Bitter linger.    \n\n\n**Throat Hit**\n\n\n\n2/10\n\n\n\n**Flavor Properties**\n\n\n\nA complex, sharp vanilla flavor with a mild creamy texture. A bit of vanilla spice on the inhale, with notes of orange and lemon citrus, a dark caramel and cinnamon on the exhale. This flavor is semi-sweet, or perhaps one might even find it to be bittersweet, similar to the sweetness of a dark chocolate, in that there is a touch of sweetness that offsets the bitterness, but I wouldn’t characterize this as a sweet flavor. (This flavor doesn’t taste like dark chocolate, only comparing to the sweetness level). \n\n\n\n**Relatable Flavors**\n\n\nCrema Catalana or Crème brûlée.  \n\n\n**Off Flavors**\n\n\nThere is a slight bitterness/sour milk note and a faint alcohol note. Tastes slightly chemical or artificial to me.  \n\n\n**Position In The Recipe**\n\n\nSome may enjoy this as a standalone flavor, however it wouldn’t be a single flavor vape for me. This can be a useful flavor if used the right way (and it agrees with your palate), such as added spice to a cream/custard base, but it’s lacking somewhat in sweetness and is a bit light and sharp for a single flavor vape or base ingredient. For me the off flavors and strength of the spice have kept this out of any of my recipes.     \n\n\n**Pairings**\n\n\nCreams, Custards, Bakeries, Bold Fruits, Tobacco, Coffee, Caramel, Chocolate, Spices \n\n\n**Notes**\n\n\nWhile it is a complex flavor, and on paper it hits many of the notes of a true Catalan Cream, it doesn’t seem like I’m actually tasting the real thing. This flavor is like the spice mix without the actual dessert. While it has notes of dark caramel, it’s lacking the intensity of the burnt sugar crust. While it is slightly creamy, it is missing the weight and body of the cream/custard. It’s more bittersweet than sweet and the vanilla bean flavor overpowers the cinnamon and citrus notes. The cinnamon is very faint, and if I didn’t already know what to look for, I might not have been able to identify it at all. The off flavors may drop off at lower percentages with the potent spice still remaining present in a mix. \n\n\n\n\n**Recipes**\n[ELR Sorted by Rating](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/1262?exclsingle=0&filter=0&sort=score&direction=desc#recipes)\n\n\n**Purchasing Information**\n\n\n[Bull City Vapor](http://www.bullcityvapor.com/catalan-cream-fa/)\n\n\n**Price** \n\n\n$2.49/10mL \n\n\n$4.99/30mL \n\n\n$12.99/120mL\n\n\n**Rating** *65.2/100* \n\n\nIf you disagree, well that’s just like, your opinion man.\n\n\n(But you should write that down there in the comments) ",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FA Cherry Bee, 1 and 2.5%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 21 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Another Flavourart UK blend, this time billed as \"a long standing favourite with the distinct flavours of Cherry and Brandy blended to give a pleasurable vape.\"  In the grand scheme of lowered expectations with cherry flavors, it's actually a relatively non-medicinal or plastic jammy dark cherry filling.  Cherry note is closer to a \"red\"  artificial cherry or at least pretty heavily cooked cherry, without a lot of fresh brightness. The brandy part of this helps to darken this up though, making it seem a bit deeper, warmer, and richer.  There's a relatively light spice note toward the back of this although it could just be the brandy pulling out some the dryer, spicier skin notes from the cherry.  It almost tastes like a light clove flavor.\n\nVaping through that weird burst of initial harshness, the inhale is on the high side of medium sweet and a bit sticky. Deeper candy cherry flavor, but a little more cooked than like a medicinal cough drop flavor.  Exhale is moderately dense and fairly similar to the inhale. Deeper cooked but still lightly artificial cherry flavor. Some relatively light bitter medicinal top notes, but it's really subdued for a cherry. Deeper brown liquor notes come in on the back half the exhale.  Makes the cherry taste more cooked than soaked in booze. Light clove-ish spice right on the tail end. Mouthfeel is actually a bit gelatinous and really smooth. Sweetness level is maybe just a bit undersweet for a cherry filling, but overall it's still on the sweet side.  Some harshness on the back end, seems pretty tied into the spice note here.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  A little bit of the usual medicinal carnage with cherries, but it's really light in comparison to straight cherry flavors.  It's also less dry than INW Cherries.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  This is fairly harsh, but it seems to settle in pretty quickly. I've set it down and come back to it a couple of times, and the first couple of drags have a kind of dry harshness but it fades to a lighter throat hit after that, mostly on the tail.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**   The relative lack of the medicinal note is going to make this pretty versatile.\n\nI'd run with the cherry filling thing. Seems like a really good pairing for bakeries in general.\n\nI also want to dump more booze on top of this, either a boozier brandy or some bourbon.  The jammy sweetness would go well with even stronger brown liquor notes.\n\nI can also see using this fruit mixes, especially where you're going sweet and jammy. I think this would mix really well with darker berries.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, this works better at relatively higher percentages for Flavourart. 1% is dry and a bit medicinal. It's also sort of spicy. More like cherry skin than anything else. 2.5% is still a bit dry and that spice note seems too pronounced.  That jammier dark cherry filling is starting to come out, but it's still too dry on balance. This really starts coming together at about 3.5%. That jammier cherry moves more to the front and the dryness seems a lot more subdued. 4% is probably my sweet spot, that jammyness is nice, dark, and sweet and you're getting a clearer cooked cherry. Flavor starts to feel a bit blown out at 4.5%. Those medicinal notes start to creep back in. By 5% this feels pretty medicinal.\n\nSo theoretically this is just blended flavourart flavors, but I'm not 100% sure how they got here. It tastes a bit more complex than just FA Cherry and FA Brandy. If someone manages to crack the code on this, i think this blend provides some really good clues on making bakery cherry work.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nNot a lot.\n\n[Here's the product page from Flavourart UK, the description is buried on there: \"Cherry Bee is a long standing favourite with the distinct flavours of Cherry and Brandy blended to give a pleasurable vape.\"](http://www.flavourart.co.uk/blended-flavourings-10ml.html)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FA Cinnamon Ceylon @ .25% and %1, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 28 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Just the spice note from cinnamon. Nothing else really going on except for that spicy cinnamon note.  It's a really thin or narrow warming flavor, over a super neutral base.  Mostly top notes with some really subtle actual cinnamon stick body.  Even at higher percentage I can taste the VG underneath that cinnamon spice.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Cinnamon flavors tend to have a bit of a sour-tasting base underneath and this does as well. It's pretty subtle all things considered and shouldn't be a problem in a mix.  Other people report a savory curry note here.  I'm not picking up on that so much as I'm just associating that with the actual taste of powdered cinnamon.\n\n**Throat Hit:** A bit, but it's cinnamon.  Even better, it just's the part of cinnamon that gives you a throat hit. Taking that into account, not really.  Nothing weird you wouldn't expect.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  [FLV Rich Cinnamon is a thing, and it's pretty great.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/4p3d3a/flv_rich_cinnamon/)  My usage for FA Cinnamon Ceylon is basically wherever that won't fit.  Use this where you don't want a full, richer, slightly powdery cinnamon flavor.\n\nGood accent flavor especially for cinnamon candy recipes. It gives you a cinnamon spice without a ton of body, letting the other ingredients really carry the structure of the vape while just giving you a hit of warm spice.\n\nStrips away enough of the body of cinnamon that it almost tastes pre-mulled, like a liquid that has had a cinnamon stick simmered in it for a pretty solid length of time. Useful in cocktails or beverage vapes, just leaving you with a kick of cinnamon warmth and not too much else.\n\nIn terms of fruit pairings, I'd use this precisely where cinnamon won't fit like with brighter fruits and citruses. It won't dominate a mix like rich cinnamon in those applications.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nThis stuff is a little weaker than you'd think, or at least the flavor here plays on a really specific level and it doesn't really blow out the rest of the vape. S&V concentration testing, this is noticeable but light down at 1 drop per 10ml.  All of the limited cinnamon body shows up down low and doesn't really scale with the spice note. Increasing the percentage really just bumps the spice up. 1% is still not \"spicy\" to me. It sounds bizzare but honestly I'm fine with this up to about 3%. It gets fairly aggressive up that high and it has a tendency to mute other flavors, but it's still a really narrow flavor, just giving you those top notes.  For the masochists, you can take this crazy high and It never crosses into a full bakery cinnamon although it can get a bit dry and it'll raise hell with the other flavors in the mix. As the spice increases it actually moves away from the relative fullness you get down low.  Moreso than most, this is definitely a \"to taste\" kind of flavor based on what you're trying to achieve for a recipe.  I'd probably start at .25% and work up from there.  I seem to be a lot less sensitive to this stuff than other people, so YMMV.\n\nFLV Rich Cinnamon is undoubtedly a better flavor, but this stuff is perhaps a bit more flexible. Better for applications that aren't necessarily all about the cinnamon and it's only acting as a warm spice note to complement the rest of a recipe.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[So the HIC Notes kind of miss the mark with FLV Rich Cinnamon on the market. I'd actually suggest this as your candy cinnamon and Rich Cinnamon as your bakery cinnamon.](http://mamajsflavorshop.com/headinclouds-my-notes-on-flavor-descriptions/)\n\n\"This is superb bakery cinnamon flavor, more complex and true to the real spice than any other cinnamon flavoring. Although some people use it at crazy percentages for red-hot cinnamon candy - that's not the best use of this one. In recipes with bakery-type cinnamon as a major flavor, FlavourArt is perfection - no others can match it. Like real cinnamon powder, this is not a very sweet flavor. It relies on the rest of your recipe for sweetness. Spiced apple pie, cookie flavors with cinnamon, spiced beverages, sweet bakery recipes - that's where Cinnamon Ceylon really shines.\n\nIf you've been using TFA Cinnamon Spice, use FA Cinnamon Ceylon at the same percentage.\"\n\n[Cinnamon is hella interesting](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/3mwfyj/cinna_bon_cinna_non_a_bit_of_history_on_cinnamon/)\n\n[Some people get a curry note out of this stuff, check the comments.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Fa Cocoa @ %1, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 18 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Dutch process cocoa powder. Nice rich, dark chocolate, without that sour, citrusy note you get from natural cocoa powders like hershey's.  Strong, accurate cocoa flavor with a drier powdery texture.  It also has a terrible dark side, destroying coils with so much as a sideways glance.\n\nInhale is light and powdery. More mouthfeel than flavor.  Exhale is pretty dead-on to cocoa powder. Dry cocoa base and not a a whole lot else. I'm not really getting anything sharp that stands out or any creaminess in the base. Not a particularly sweet flavor, and no actual cream to it, but it has a bit of a dry marshmallow kind of texture that's interesting. \n \n**Off-flavors:**  Solo, it's pretty solidly dry. It's fairly accurate for the profile, but it's really dry.  Also, due to the coil wreckage, it tends to get muddy quickly after you vape for a while.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Light, just from all that powdery dryness. Doesn't really show up mixed with anything creamy or juicy.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  FA Cocoa and either FW or TFA white chocolate makes a hell of a dark chocolate flavor. The white chocolate really just carries the flavor and you don't have the syrupy notes from a milk chocolate concentrate getting in the way.\n\nAlso useful for pairing with a more syrupy kind of flavor like INW Milk Chocolate to give a chocolate more of a realistic edge. HeadInClouds, of course, suggests FA Chocolate, but the net result is largely the same.  Also, adding AP will apparently help a with a more realistic chocolate vape.\n\nPairs well with creams, custards, and Ice Creams for a darker chocolate flavor that something like TFA Double Chocolate Clear.\n\nThis is also dry enough to work well with nuts and tobacco mixes.\n\nThis concentrate does interesting things with fruits.  Mixing it with a darker, syrupy fruits pulls off chocolate covered fruit or cordials pretty well.\n\n**Notes:**  S&V concentration testing, I've found that this stuff is pretty linear. the actual cocoa note doesn't change all that much. At .25 it's a light hint of cocoa.  More of a instant hot chocolate taste.  At .5% it's still a bit light, but it's tasting like a fancier dry hot chocolate mix. 1% reads distinctly like darker cocoa. Tastes a bit roasted with having any kind of burnt notes. 1.5% has an even darker chocolate, and you can start to really pick out that marshamllow-y note to the sweetness here. By 2% it's getting a bit bitter and honestly a bit much.  I'd start low and work up with this, not because the flavor is bad, but you really want to put just the bare minimum of this stuff in your mixes.\n\nI really like this flavor, but it's a pain in the ass to work with. It's a really good cocoa, but it just destroys your wicks. It's not really a crusty kind of coil gore that you'd get from sucralose, it just kind of turns an entire mix muddy and dulls out any kind of brighter flavors.  Don't put this in tanks, it's just not worth it. I use it occasionally, but I'm well aware that I'm rewicking every 10ml and I'm usually using temp control.  I haven't had issues with my actual coils after a quick dry burn and a rinse, but I'm mostly on just round wire macro builds. If you're on triple-zipper-hyper-mega-fused claptons or whatever, there's a pretty good chance you'll get build up that won't be nearly as easy to rinse off.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[So yeah, this stuff will destroy your wicks.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FA Cocoon, 1 and 2.5%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 6 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  FlavourArt calls this \"Our interpretation of the moment when the warm embrace of the caramel melds with the sweetness of the apple, another amazing fairground flavour.\"  So I'm guessing cocoons are supposed to taste like a caramel apple.  I get the both the caramel and the apple.  The caramel seems at least a little softer than straight FA Caramel.  Still has some of that darker, dry caramelized sugar but there is a creamier flavor in here that is dragging it a bit towards a creamier caramel sauce.  The second opinions have the apple here as a dead ringer for Fuji and I could see that.  I get some of the same dry peel note I get from fuji and the body is similar.  Top notes feel a bit different though, I'm getting a clear grassy note from this.  Feels a bit more like a green apple here, but I'm having some issues finding a solid apple flesh texture. Also feels like their is a really light pastry note on the tail end of this. Not overwhelming, but I keep on picking it up.  Not an awful solo flavor if you don't get too much dry peel weirdness, but could also have some use as a base to build a richer and brighter caramel apple juice. I'd use this around 2%.\n\nInhale has fairly dry apple up front.  Feels like more of the peel, but it fills in a bit and gets at least a little bit juicier as the inhale goes on. There's a dry caramelized sugar that comes in as the apple fills out.  Sweet, but flavourart sweet, nothing cloying or obnoxious.  There's a dryness here that feels a bit spicy, like the peel not in FA Fuji.  Exhale has a softer caramel up front. Still some of those drier, dark notes, but there's actually a good bit of creamier, softer, caramel sauce.  The apple shows up after that first burst of caramel.  It's a bit dry and grassy up top, but there is some juiciness in there as well.  Seems to be pretty similar to FA Fuji, but this tastes a little more green and grassy to me and a hair less full. There's a dry spiciness to the the apple that exacerbates some of the drier, darker caramel on the beginning of the exhale. It feels like there is a bit of a pie crust or dryer bakery note on the tail end of this, but it's subtle.  That spicy, dry apple note seems to linger a bit. \n\n**Off-flavors:**  Dry, at least for me. I have the same problem with FA Fuji, but it doesn't seem to be a common thing so take it with the usual pile of salt. I also get some pretty heavy grassy peel notes in here that don't quite gel with the apple base underneath.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Moderate. The entire thing is a bit dry, but that apple seems a little on the harsh side.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Well, there's the caramel apple thing.\n\nAs a solo flavor this feels a bit dry and grassy to me, but the components of a caramel apple are here and they feel pretty well in balance.  The pastry note I'm getting doesn't really detract from the profile either.\n\nIf you wanted to use this as a base for a caramel apple, I feel like this would benefit from a juicier apple like INW Two Apples, or even FA Pear.  Caramel is a bit trickier to punch up.  If you can stand some coil gore, a softer caramel like FW Caramel Candy or Salted Caramel could help sweeten and thicken it up.\n\nOutside of straight caramel apple, seems like a decent base for an apple pie with caramel notes, but it would still probably take an additional apple like FLV Apple Filling to really sell the pie filling.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, this might be more dependent on how much you like that FA Fuji-esque apple. At .5% and 1% this seems pretty far apple forward. Still fairly light, but I'm getting a lot more apple than caramel, with a softer, juicier flavor. At 1.5% The caramel picks up a bit, with a lighter dry caramel over that apple.  Apple peel note seems a bit heavier here as well. At 2% I'm getting more of that soft caramel, pretty well in balance with drier, darker caramel.  I'm getting quite a bit of peel off the apple flavor here, but that softer caramel is helping to balance it a bit.  I'm picking up some pastry on the backend but it's not overwhelming. At 2.5%, this seems a bit dry.  Not too drastic, but that apple peel note seems to be stepping on the caramel a a bit. At 3% seems just a touch drier and that apple is getting grassy. At 4% this is actually picking up a bit of bitterness from that grassy apple.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Here's the ELR Page.  Mostly positive notes, although user \"essey\" writes: \" In the readymix from FA this is not great! Tastes like a mess of sugary stuff. No apple flavor noticed.

Finally I am new and so everything should be taken with a grain of salt.*  \n\n**Setup**: My oldest least loved RTA, a troll with dual Kanthal Flat claptons running at 50 watts (0.15 ohms).  \n**Testing**: FlavourArt Cooked Ham. 1.5% with the rest VG no nicotine, shake and vape.  \n**Flavour Description**: Straight away it smells like ham, like warm ham you just pulled out of the oven if you cooked one, its pretty strong, normally I have to put a bottle up to my nose to get the smell but I can smell this as soon as I get the lid off.\n\nOn the inhale, well it tastes like a big chunk of cold ham from the fridge, a little sweeter than normal, like maybe you covered it in honey but with none of the honey deliciousness.\n\nThe exhale is more \"hot ham\", almost over cooked but you know what, other than the fact I am inhaling hot ham it's not so bad. \n\nIt's pretty wet from what I can tell, and watery its not really got a \"body\" to it at all, but it has a lot of inhale and exhale flavour, the troll normall gives me very little flavour but this its really right up in your face, even after the exhale the flavour is there in my throat. In saying that there is nothing that can't be removed with a sip of beer so it's not totally disgusting.\n\n**Off-flavours**: ~~Now I have chuffed through a refill, (I was enjoying it okay) I seem to be getting a slight metallic after taste, not one that I have ever had on these coils... I am not sure what that is about.~~ Changed out the old coils, all is good again, hot ham heaven.\n\n**Uses & Pairings**: It has me interested, probably not at 1.5% again, but I have some Cured ham I am going to try next. Maybe it could be layered, maybe it could be put with some Kentucky Bourbon and some pineapple or honey but I think down very low like 0.25%. Its not bad but it's no single flavour.\n\nI would like to know if anyone had some non sweet ideas for melon, and for giving it a more meaty body, and some butter, I think it needs butter.\n\n**Second Opinions**: None that I could find (not sure if that says more about me or others sense of adventure?)\n\n ",

    "markdown": "**Setup:** Recoil w/ flavor barrel, Dual 15 wrap 26g 3mm Nifethal 70 coils @.17 ohms.  60w power, 450F temp limit. Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FA Cookie @ 2%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 9 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** A homemade drop cookie base bordering on a butter/crisp cookie. Moderately fluffy with a really nice cooked vanilla extract note and some well balanced, reasonably authentic butter. Some darker crunchy notes in there, like where your cookies spread a bit thin and overcook toward the edges.  Richer taste than mouthfeel, overall effect reads just a bit dry.\n\nInhale is fluffy and light.  Not much actual flavor but a really light tangy kind of butter vibe.  Exhale has that lightly baked cookie up front, with a really warm aromatic vanilla tinge.  Again, has some volume, but not a lot of density. Back half of the exhale is a bit more interesting with some darker cookie notes and a strangely realistic butter tang in there. Pretty clean on the exhale with a light lingering butter finish, with a little bit of a greasy mouthfeel.  Sweetness overall is damn near perfect, still very much a dessert but doesn't have a thick, cloying, or artificial sweetness.  Mouthfeel just doesn't keep up with some the richness you taste. I know Flavourart is cool for no diacetyl thing, but I just want a little more richness out of this to match how full the taste is.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Nah, man. Pretty spot on.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Light, mostly due to the dryness. I get some harsher hits as that dryness builds.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  So, this is a great base for a cookie.  Add in whatever the hell you want, maybe some extra richness, and there's a cookie.  Sky's the limit here. I'd stick with relatively dry fruits and nothing particulary green, but otherwise go for it. Dryer nuts can give you a bit of a shortbread thing which is cool.\n\nI don't feel like this mixes particularly well outside of that cookie application.  It has a tendency to just sit at the bottom of your mixes.  I actually wouldn't end up using this as a more generic bakery additive as it's just too distinctive and there are usually other ways to get there.  If you want a crunchier, buttery cookie texture, use INW Biscuit. If you want some cookie volume use CAP Sugar Cookie.  I'm sure you can make it work somehow, but it seems like a lot of effort when there are better tools for the job.  You might get some play in bakery crusts specifically.  It does a decent job of emulating something like a crushed nilla wafer crust but you'd have bump up the vanilla a bit.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nS&V Concentration testing, .5% is a little thin and astringent. You get mostly rich butter and roasted part of the cookie. 1% is better, but this really starts to flesh out at 1.5%. It reads as distinctly cookie, and that butter and roast is balanced with the lighter fluffy part of the cookie. At 3%, the the entire thing just starts to taste raw and weird.  It may settle down a bit in time, but it reads as weird, tangy, and heavily disjointed.  I'd mix with at 1.5%-2.5% depending on how fluffy you want your cookie base.\n\nTerrible confession time, I prefer this over CAP Sugar Cookie as an actual cookie by a pretty wide margin. The difference in taste is pretty stark, at least solo. This ends up tasting more like a cookie somebody actually touched at some point. It's a bit of a messy flavor, but in the best possible way. It tastes home-baked.  You get a good amount of nuance and it even tastes a little unevenly cooked and greasy.  CAP Sugar Cookie has always tasted like one of the disappointing sugar cookies you find in an open plastic clamshell in a break room.  You then eat like 3 and regret it, and most of the choices that brought you to that point (just me?).  You can counteract that with a good amount of diacetyl (shout to CAP Vanilla Custard v1, the real mvp) but it just tastes too homogeneous and plain for an actual cookie.  I'm not huge on CAP bakeries in general, and I've had excellent applications of Sugar Cookie so YMMV.  I like FA Cookie though, it seems to have just a tiny bit of soul and that's pretty impressive.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Obligatory HIC notes:](http://mamajsflavorshop.com/headinclouds-my-notes-on-flavor-descriptions/)\n\n\"Very versatile flavoring!This cookie flavoring has no diketone ingredients, which sets it apart from others. This is a very neutral, mildly sweet cookie base. There are no spices, vanilla, or other flavors to interfere with your additions. It can be used standalone (some like it that way), as a cookie base, or to add bakery effects to recipes. It adds rich, warm, mildly sweet, baked flavor. If you're making a cookie recipe with bold flavors, start with 1.5 - 2% Cookie. Add Anise, Almond, perhaps a little Marzipan for a very traditional, crunchy Italian cookie flavor. Or add your favorite nuts and fruits flavor to that for biscotti variations (Cherry-Almond, Orange-Nut Mix, Lemon-Almond, etc.). Try with two widely-contrasting flavors, like Coconut-Bilberry. Including a hint of Anise in biscotti always adds an authentic Italian touch.For smooth, sweet, rich cookies, begin with 1-1.5% Cookie and 0.5% Vienna Cream, then add your flavors. For an even sweeter start, include a little Butterscotch - even (under) 0.25% will sweeten enough to stand up to the boldest flavor additions (like Espresso, Hazelnut, Brandy, or strong spices).\"\n\n[Reddit sez: Love it or hate it apparently.

I can't say it tastes like Coke or Pepsi, but it is reminiscent of some sort of dark cola.  Strangely, this flavor seems more \"bubbly\" than some champagne flavors I've tried.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  I'm getting a slight plastic taste, and the citrus note bothers me a bit simply because it seems like it shouldn't be there.\n\n**Throat hit:** 7/10\n\n**Uses:**  Due to it's nature, this flavor will play into a soda type of mix very well.  It could also be used to give a slight \"carbonated\" effect.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FA Fig @ 2%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 12 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  This is interesting. Sort of a non-descript, juicy, fruit flavor. I get mostly yellow peach and passionfruit, with some juicier pear notes.  Really hard to pin down and it changes a bit everytime I pick it up. Strong natural sweetness and moderate density.\n\nInhale is very sweet and a bit dark. Tastes a lot like the syrup in canned pears. Warm with some harshness, hard to take really deep lung hits. Exhale starts with a warm and dense juicy yellow canned peach flavor.  Some high perfumey green notes, not really defined enough for a peel.  More of a indistinct harshness. Back half ends up tasting quite a bit like a Passionfruit syrup, as some bright red fruit notes creep in. Still sweet bordering on syrupy. Clean finish, even that pronounced sweetness fades out pretty quickly. \n\n**Off-flavors:**  Slight green note, not sure what the hell else should or should not be here but everything else tastes pretty cohesive and solid. Sweetness level is pretty distracting in general.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Moderate on the inhale, light on the exhale. Nothing too major, especially considering most of the fruits that share some of the same flavor components tend to be pretty harsh.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Just spitballing, but I can't really think of a fruit this won't end up blending with. The juicyness here will help to soften some of the brighter fruit flavors like strawberries and kiwi, mellow out citrus, complement tropical fruits, and bring some sweetness and brightness to darker berry mixes.  I'd avoid anything too syrupy just to keep the overall sweetness of a mix in check, but otherwise go crazy with it.  This is going to bump the throat hit up a notch, so if your mix is turning out a bit harsh try scaling it back.\n\nHarder to recommend for bakeries, that juicy note is going to be distracting if you want to keep defined edges and layers in your flavor.  I don't think it'll taste bad per se, but it's going to be like pouring a fruit syrup straight on top of you nice fluffy or crispy pastry.\n\nThis is not a dark fig for mixing with tobaccos or nutty mixes. Again, the textural issues are going to show up pretty quickly and the sweetness is a bit intense.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nS&V concentration testing, 1% gives you a more perfumey peach. At 1.5% that sweetness starts to come in and feels pretty saturated by 2%. The passionfruit shows up big, and just keeps getting juicier up until about 3.5%.  Sort of comes back around to floral at 3% and that syrup character is pretty overwhelming.  I'd mix with this starting at 1.5% and work up until you hit your desired sweetness level, watching for that throat hit and the green perfume notes turning things a bit bitter. \n\nSo far as I can tell, there is only one Flavour Art fig flavor.  Flavour Art's website only has the one fig, billed as Fig Fresh. Sold as just \"Fig\" on BCF and \"Fresh Fig\" on ECX.  If I'm wrong, then please correct me.\n\nAnother instance in which I don't have a fantastic frame of reference for actual figs. I've found some notes saying that this close to a realistic fresh fig, but I'll have to take that on faith.  Nothing I'd expect from a darker, richer version of a \"fig,\" but a great sweetener for fruit mixes.  Watch your throat hit, though.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[HIC Notes:](http://mamajsflavorshop.com/headinclouds-my-notes-on-flavor-descriptions/)  \"Sweet, fresh figs. Fig tastes “riper” when accented with FA Apple (not Fuji) or FA Amber. At amounts under 1%, Fig makes a bright sweetener for bold fruit flavors.\"\n\n[So, in an older FOTW for pear /u/dbbldz123/ drops a comment that says that FA Fig smells like pear and goes great with pear flavor.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/3s4rad/flavor_of_the_week_pear/cwu93u5/) It's a quick mention, but it's spot on.  That's what helped me place this flavor and start thinking about stuff like TFA Quince.  So thanks to /u/dbbldz123/.  FWIW, I got a lot of pear and apple out of this before it really saturated my palate.\n\n[Flavour Arts website copy for this is interesting:](https://flavourart.com/en/store/flavors/sweet/fig-fresh-flavor/) \"Sweet and Juicy.\" Same two words I'd use to describe this. A sort of muddled, indistinct sweet and juicy fruit flavor.\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FA Florida Key Lime @ .5% and 1.5%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 9 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Bright, fresh key limes.  Relatively subdued zest, juicy and tart body, and pretty heavy but still natural tasting sweetness.  On the harsh side, but sells a fresher, sweetened key lime pretty well.  Fairly potent, I'd use at .5% for a lighter accent and up to 2% if you're sinking it heavier creams or custards or complex bakeries.\n\nInhale is tart key lime juice, with clear but not overwhelming bright acidity. Lighter, slightly airy mouthfeel with a warm, building sugary sweetness.  Exhale is fuller, with a solid key lime right down the middle. Higher brighter acidity with a slight bitter zest edge.  I'm getting a bit of actual juiciness here, with a deeper sweet body that doesn't quite cross the line into syrupy.  Moderately harsh, but pretty well balanced overall. Lingering zest and some acidic rawness.  A little bit of a sugar lips effect.  I do a get a bit of warm, waxiness in the mouthfeel, but only when the wick drys out a bit. Fully saturated, I can't really pick out that waxy note.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Nah.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Pretty solid. It's not necessarily harsh for a citrus, but it's fairly harsh overall.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Pretty versatile flavor. Used low, it should be a pretty good accent flavor in fruit mixes.  Good bright acidity to set off other fruits without adding too much bitter zest.  Kind of tossing fruit in lime juice to bring some extra brightness and \"pop.\"\n\nGood for a more realistic key lime note in creams and custards.  I think it'll work better overall in heavier creams and custards, but it'll taste a bit raw and uncooked. Still not a fantastic fit for lighter creams, but probably better than TPA Key Lime.\n\nMaybe a bit bright and acidic for bakeries solo, but It could end up working, especially with a deeper citrus body.\n\nGood beverage lime. Think more like a sweeter limeade rather than a cocktail lime twist.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing at .25% and .5%, this tastes a lot like a sweeter version of the distilled version of FA Lime Tahity.  Bright, a bit acidic, with some (pretty subtle) carbonated mouthfeel.  Sweet, but not too thick.  1% has a sweeter body overall, with less of a carbonated mouthfeel and a bit of juicyness.  Thicker, but still on the light side.  1.5% is sweeter, with that acid balanced pretty well by that sweetness.  Decent body here.  2% is heavier, with just a touch of waxiness.  Sweetness is pretty heavy, right on the verge of syrupy.  Still pretty bright, but a bit fuller.  3% is a bit too much for me personally. I'm finding it syrupy, waxy, harsh, and bitter. I'd recommend using this at around .5% for a lime accent for fruitier mixes, and 1.5%-2% for a primary flavor.\n\nComparing this to [TPA Key Lime](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/4tthxz/tfa_key_lime_flavor_review/),  The FA Version seems to have a bit more natural acidity and zest and is quite a bit less syrupy.  I think they are both on the harsh side.  TPA seems like a heavier, thicker flavor than the FA Version, with a candy kind of profile.  FA overall seems a bit fresher and nuanced.  I don't necessarily think one is clearly better than the other, but I'd lean towards the FA version because I think the flavor seems a bit more balanced and I like the freshness. TPA Key Lime is a bit bolder, but I've never been a huge fan of that flatter, heavy sweetness.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nStill pretty new, so not a lot out there.\n\n[The page from Flavourart.

Hard to pick out individual berries, but if I had to try, I'd say blackcurrant, blackberry, blueberry, maybe a hint of raspberry. I don't notice any medicinal or off flavors with it.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FA Gin @ %2, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 13 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Juniper, basically.  Really heavy on the juniper, with a lighter sour lemon base and some raw alcohol notes tucked away in there.  Not particularly juicy or wet, but manages to avoid coming across as dry juniper needles.  Fairly delicate flavor, with a light overall sweetness and nothing that reads as straight bitter.\n\nInhale is a slightly sour and moderately dense.  High pine-resiny top notes over a pretty non-descript base. Really mild sweetness.  Exhale has soft sour lemon right up front, and then those those juniper top notes kick in on the back half.  Definitely more of a juniper berry at first, with  the tail end of the exhale picking up a lot of pine or spruce notes.  A relatively light raw alcohol right in the middle of that transition where the concentrate just seems to \"click\" for a moment. Lingering christmas tree finish as those spruce notes get pretty pronounced and the rest of the flavor thins out.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Nah. Definitely reads \"gin.\"\n\n**Throat Hit:** No, not really if you're into this kind of thing. Little bit of a tingling sensation in the mouth, but nothing going on in the throat.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  We've got to talk cocktails, right? Half the battle is going to be mouthfeel. This definitely tastes like gin, the problem is the texture. I'd add a low percentage of CAP Cucumber for more savory cocktails, and INW Cactus for sweeter cocktails to get that base kind of wetness you need. You're also going to want some kind of cooling, just for that iced drink effect.  Koolada is my go to for that, usually at .25%.  Traditionally used with some citrus, preferably a juicier, sweeter citrus unless you just want a lime twist from FA Aurora. Works well with juicier dark berries like FA Blackcurrant and FLV Cranberry. FA Cucumber would also be an option. Florals can work, but use them sparingly. \"Greener\" florals that have more an actual plant vibe work better, so FA Jasmine, FLV Elderflower, or just a tiny bit of Rose.  Champagnes will work well and add to the dryer boozy vibe.  And [FW Martini](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/5j2q0i/fw_martini/) tastes just like dry vermouth.\n\nBeyond cocktails, this is going to get a bit weird. You could add a very very low percentage (like 1 drop per 30ml) to fruit mixes to pop some of the greener peel notes with that extra kick of pine-ish juniper but it'd be really easy to over do.\n\nAnything past that, and you're on your own.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nS&V concentration testing, this still pretty distinctive at .5%. If anything, you get more raw alcohol and that juniper note is relatively mellow and the sweetness is pretty non-existent. 1% brings in some of that sweetness and those top notes taste pretty authentically light and herbal. 1.5% has quite a bit more body, and those juniper notes are getting more aggressive. 2% is prominent juniper. 2.5% is getting sort of off-puttingly sweet solo, and that juniper is losing a lot nuance and going straight tree.  3% is getting bitter overall and a bit rough.  I'd use this in a more floral, lighter bodied cocktail at 1%, knowing that the cactus or cucumber will be watering this down a bit and softening some of that juniper. I'd bump up to 2-2.5% for a cocktail involving some sweetness and citrus, as you'd need that to get the juniper to get this to carry over a more aggressive citrus zest and koolada to temper the sweetness and avoid it building on your palate.\n\nA solid but not remarkable gin, easily available for damn near everyone.  Overall a little one-note with that heavy juniper but perfectly serviceable for most of your gin needs.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[HIC Notes:](http://mamajsflavorshop.com/headinclouds-my-notes-on-flavor-descriptions/)\n\n\"The very realistic aroma and flavor of actual gin (with the same distinct juniper flavor), especially right after mixing. \n\nIt is a little bit sweet. This is an excellent addition to fruity vapes, even if you don't drink alcohol. Adding 1% FA Gin makes light fruit flavors bright and summery; it adds spark to darker fruits and berries; it enhances all the citrus flavors.Use 2% or more Gin with fruits for vape-replicas of cocktails. Just look online at bartender recipes for inspiration (google 'gin cocktails' for a good start.)Combined with some fruits, even 2% Gin can give you a nonalcohol flavor. 2% Gin, 1% Lime Tahiti, 1% Cherry reminds me more of soda or tonic water than a mixed drink.\"\n\n[Happy Hour FTOW Thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/5d222x/its_fotw_happy_hour_this_weeks_flavor_of_the_week/) Both u/HokusKrokus/ and u/ID10-T/ call it straight juniper. /u/bogey_again finds it a bit more nuanced, calling it \"juniper, coriander, with licorice basically woody with some some spice.\"\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

It's an interesting kind of gnarly... so that's something. It's probably the first concentrate I've had that reads this musky.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FA Hazelnut @ %1, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 14 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Nutty raw hazelnuts with a bit of a praline sweetness and a light metallic twinge on the backend.  The nut flavor is actually surprisingly dead on to hazelnuts, giving you that almost nutella thing, as opposed to the creamy, maltier FW Hazelnut.  Super strong, but useful as a mixer to bolster other nuts or a sort of non-specific raw nut at a lower percentage.\n\nInhale is fairly dense and nutty.  Definitely leans towards a \"greener\" tasting kind of nut like raw almonds or hazelnuts. A little sweeter than you'd expect for raw nuts, but the sweetness fits pretty well.  Kind of a cream sweetness, without any of the dairy.  Sweetness kind of builds and takes over on the inhale, getting a bit metallic toward the end. Exhale has a pretty dead-on hazelnut up-front, with that praline sweetness comes through on the back half of the exhale. I can taste just a bit of buttery richness in there along with the sweetness. If you told me this was a praline flavor, I'd totally believe you at 1%. Sweetness isn't overbearing, but it's there.  Again, moderately dense. Most of the nuttiness here is front-loaded. Tail end of the exhale picks up a bit of a metallic taste, almost like smelling change.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Gets a bit metallic on the inhale and towards the very back of the exhale. Not a deal-breaker or anything, but it's there.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Light. That praline sweetness is just a bit sharp.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I like using this for a bakeries as a truer nut flavor.  It tends to layer well with a drier base, sitting on top. I used it in my [Dogma recipe](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/31789#dogma_by_concreteriver) for exactly that purpose, simulating a slivered almond.\n\nMy other personal favorite pairing with this is FLV Red Burley. It really seems to pop the drier cocoa notes in tobaccos and get downright chocolately with bringing in any waxy mouthfeel.  Should work well any non-ashy tobaccos to reinforce nutty character and add some pretty mellow cocoa notes for more a dessert tobacco vape.\n\nThis is also damn near perfect for mixing with a deeper chocolate to give you more a nutella vibe.  Mixes well with lighter creams. My favorite is FLV Cream.  Gives it a lightly sour note and plays well with the light spice to give you a fairly realistic fresh milk flavor.\n\nI'm not a huge fan of mixing this with fruits solo, the flavors just don't blend all the way\n\n**Notes:**  S&V Concentration testing, this is potent stuff. I get a pretty neutral but pronounced nuttiness at .25%. Fairly non-specific this low, but it definitely reads as nutty. I've used the relative dryness and distinct nutty taste here to layer in a discrete almond sliver.  .5% is ramping it up a bit, and the nuttiness is starting to come in clear as hazelnut. .75% is getting sweeter, with that praline kind of note coming in pretty strong. 1% is starting to be dominated by that praline sweetness, and by 1.5% this concentrate just seems too strong and blown out.  I'd recommend starting with this at .25% and working up for most applications. Maybe in a heavier chocolate application something like .5%. I don't see a ton of use for this above 1%.\n\nThe biggest question here is how the compares to the more widely used FW Hazelnut, and honestly they don't have a lot of overlap. FW Hazelnut is great, but it doesn't do a great job of actually evoking discrete halzelnuts. It's more a hazelnut cream.  This is definitely a nut, and as such is pretty interesting. The off-notes get a little weird at anything above .5%, but under that it's a pretty useful ingredient that will give you a sweeter type of raw nut flavor without pushing the rest of your mix around too much.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Here are your HIC notes, farily solid this time:](http://mamajsflavorshop.com/headinclouds-my-notes-on-flavor-descriptions/)\n\n\"In my opinion, this is the single most accurate nut flavor that any manufacturer produces. It's the flavor of hazelnuts without the papery brown skin. This is an excellent flavor to add to your chocolate candy bar recipes.FA Hazelnut carefully mixed with acetyl pyrazine (plus Caramel and other accents) can give the impression of peanut butter.In dessert and coffee recipes, even 0.25% can add sufficient hazelnut flavor for most vapers. It's excellent for hazelnut coffee.If you're looking to add nutty notes to tobacco, you might prefer FA Nut Mix instead of this distinctive hazelnut flavor.\"\n\nSome quick mentions on the sub [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/363efr/fa_hazelnut_replacement_by_fw_hazelnut/.

Take away the sweet and cream from FW, make it a more accurate flavor, strengthen it x10 or more, and you have FA Hazelnut. The two are not interchangeable.\"](http://vapingunderground.com/threads/fw-hazelnut-vs-the-rest.91015/)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FA Hypnotic Mist @ 2%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 17 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** I'll officially state, up front, that I've found no concrete evidence of what the actual inspiration for this concentrate is.  With that said, other people have noted citrus and I'm going to double down on a seville or bitter orange based flavor.  Almost like a creamy bergamot without all  the heavy zest I get from FA Bergamot.  Actual vape is pleasant, with creamy desaturated orange flesh flavor along with some herbaceous undertones and a lingering natural tasting bitterness.  Pushes into a creamy earl grey tea.\n\nInhale is some light lemon or orange zest along with a bitter herbal notes. Moderately dense exhale. Herbal top notes without any kind of vegetal taste.  Relatively warm and a little bitter.  Reminds me of good black tea.  The citrus is underneath that.  Creamy, non-dairy, orange flesh.  I wouldn't call it juicy, but it's really smooth.  Orange note is really similar to the orange note in Aperol.  Sweet, but not overwhelmingly so.  Exhale tails off into a slightly bitter raw tea flavor.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Nothing off-putting or aggressively wrong here.  I'm not sure what Hypnotic Mist should taste like, but nothing that seems out of place.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Nope.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:** \n\nComplex and satisfying enough for a single flavor. Mixing will be a bit difficult, just because of how complex this comes across.  It's kind of like a creamsicle in bizarro world where everyone is wearing linen suits.\n\nThis already almost just tastes like Earl Grey tea so FA Black Tea or something similar.  The herabal notes here will line up well with more tea.\n\nMight be an interesting addition to citrus mixes.  You can get a good deal of flesh with some added herbal complexity without taking the harsh zest type of flavor up.\n\nCuracao and Grand Marnier both use bitter oranges heavily, so it may end up being the missing ingredient in a good cocktail vape either as a stand-in for triple sec or a sweetness component in something that apes an italian amaro.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nS&V concentration testing, I get a dryer herbal flavor at .5 to 1%.  That orange is pretty subdued up until 2%. The orange keeps scaling up pretty well, but I lose a lot of the herbal complexity at 3 and 4%.  After that it just gets perfumey and bitter in an unpleasant way.  I'd recommend staying at 2% on this either solo or as a mix, honestly.  It gives you you enough herbal notes to be interesting while still having a good orange flavor. Maybe 3% if you're mostly after that orange and plan on adding something else herbal or floral as a complement.  Also of note, this is going to require at least a moderate steep to smooth out the floral/herbal flavors and let some of that creaminess come through.\n\nSo the bitter orange thing... this is my theory, researched only with the finest half-assed googling and flailing inferences.  Flavor Art is an Italian company.  Bitter oranges are a thing in a lot of Mediterranean cuisine and are fairly common in Italy.  Neroli, which is the essential oil from the bitter orange peel, traditionally had been used as a hypnotic sedative and still has a devoted following of aromatherapy weirdos.  It's definitely a citrus here.  I'm saying all the pieces fit and I'm calling that bitter orange is somewhere in here.\n\nAll in all, pretty nice.\n\n**Second Opinions:** \n\n/u/Boogenshizzle had posted up some notes about this previously that weren't linked through the flavor review section.

    "markdown": "**Setup:** Recoil w/ flavor barrel, Dual 15 wrap 26g 3mm Nifethal 70 coils @.17 ohms.  60w power, 450F temp limit. Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FA Jasmine @ 2% Solo, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 7 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Does what it says on the box, jasmine.  It's a hard flavor to break down much more. Overall it's a thin flavor, mostly top notes. Definitely fragrant, but manages to avoid going just straight bitter perfume. Slightly tart vaped solo, but that seems to be a theme with florals.  Closer to a rose type of leafy flavor than a more astringent and aggresive lavender.\n\nInhale is tart and thin. Some bitter perfume notes show up as the heat builds. Exhale is light, with smooth jasmine as a fairly mellow top note. Some minimal leafy and tart body but overall not too astringent or sour.  Mildly green, but in a nonobtrusive way.  Delicate sweetness offset by a light green bitterness. Overall effect is strangely balanced and reassuring. Probably an association with green tea.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Nah.\n\n**Throat Hit:** No real throat hit.  Super thin, so it's weird to be missing something thicker and smoother down low.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  A whole lot green and white teas use some jasmine, and this does an admirable job of simulating that. Almost herbaceous green flavor will mix with and complement a more floral tea very well.  Pairs well with citrus in general, so go to town on juicier citrus and jasmine in your non-black teas.\n\nFruit pairings are going to be pretty subjective. I think, in general, this goes well with deeper juicier fruits like Apple, Guava, Pear, and Mango.  Isn't bad with brighter berries like raspberries but tends to make fruit flavors a bit too floral for general consumption.\n\nA little green and weird for me when it comes to mixing with creams. Herbaceous flavors and creams just have never worked for me, always tasting just a bit strange.\n\nIt's a specialized case, but I've found this is really good for fleshing out and giving body to a citrus rind note. Most citrus has plenty of zest, but no real rind to speak of.  This simulates the pith of citrus remarkably well.  Ruthless self-promotion, but I've used this in my [Terrorhawk recipe](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/13499#terrorhawk_by_concreteriver) to bring the lightly fragant and slightly papery pith back into a ruby red grapefruit. It feels more like you've got an entire segment of citrus as opposed to just the juice.  I've experimented with orange and lemon it does largely the same thing across the citrus spectrum.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nSeems to be pretty easy-going for a floral. S&V concentration testing, definitely noticeable at .5%.  You get most of the floral notes down low. The actual green note comes through after at around 1% and scales pretty linearly to 3%. Gets too green after that.  I'd start mixing this at .25% if you want just a light hint of \"something\" in a mix. It's going to fairly hard to identify, but distinct enough to be interesting. Mixing with fruits, I would start at .5% and work up.  It's a weird flavor note and kind of hard to \"untaste\" if it jumps out at you in the mix.  The green notes here work really well in that green tea application, so I'd start at 1.5% for that profile.  I use it a 2% for the citrus pith effect.\n\nRandom notes, as of a couple of months ago this got weirdly expensive at BCF. ECX still has it for what seems like a more normal price.  Also, as far as I can tell Jasmine and Jasmine Natural are the same thing.  This concentrates separates quite a bit, so that shaking prior to use is really essential.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[/u/HocusKrokus continues to make these walls of text look silly:](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/4t7z6g/some_notes_on_florals/)\n\n\"FA Jasmine: Very bright and lush jasmine flavor. Fairly floral, and a bit more forgiving. Good up to 2.5 or 3% in a mix, or around 3-4% standalone. Doesn't need as much sweetening. Works excellently with tea, candies (I really enjoy it with FW Swedish Fish), and is probably one of the best to add to bakeries like light pastry or pies. Better with heavier creams like bavarian or custard than Lavender, and works well with vanilla also.\"\n\n[Good general discussion on florals, including some notes on jasmine usage and how it doesn't get as obnoxious as rose.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/4smm4g/discussion_florals/)\n\n[Pretty much obligatory HIC notes:](http://mamajsflavorshop.com/headinclouds-my-notes-on-flavor-descriptions/) \"Jasmine is right at home with FA Black Tea. Use 2-3 parts of tea to 1 part Jasmine.\"\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Very thick mouth feel. Reminds me a lot of the freshly fried sugared donuts you get at a carnival or fair or maybe a funnel cake.\n\n**Off-flavors:** I've had reports of stale beer at higher percentages.\n\n**Throat hit:** 5/10\n\n**Uses:**  Provides a deep fried sugary sensation by adding 0.5-1% to a recipe.  2% gets a bit doughy, and at 3% and over it might get weird on you.  I use it in my [Grape Ice Cream Cone recipe](http://tjek.nu/r/62b9) at 2% without it being too much.  Certain flavorings such as INW Biscuit seem to really amplify the doughiness.  Could also work as a sweetener or substitute for EM under 0.5%\n\n**Pairings:**  Bakery type flavorings such as biscuit, cake, cookie, or donut type flavors.  Plays well with creams and chocolates also.  I can also see this working with apple, peach, or pear flavorings in a pie/cobbler type recipe.\n\n**Notes:**   I would say for the most part that is typically going to be a supporting flavor at lower percentages.  It is definitely very unique with what it adds to a recipe. It isn't bad by itself at 2% IMO, yet doesn't really carry enough of a punch to be a standalone.  This flavor is a great example of how a flavor can really change when you use too much.  Start low and adjust to your liking!  I'm going to page /u/enyawreklaw so he can maybe add something in here, as he uses it in a couple of his extremely popular recipes.\n\nEDIT: [Link to all of our flavor reviews in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)",

Vanilla pound cake flavor, slightly dense, topped with a dark caramel. It has a background of citrus fruit to me. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n- I get a citrus pound cake flavor, fairly sweet, reminds me strongly of an unglazed lemon-lime bundt cake, drizzled with a dark caramel. The caramel is not creamy like the candy or a sundae topping. Similar to a caramel that has been cooked until just before it scorches, where most of the sugar has cooked out and it's no longer sickeningly sweet. I don't want to say bitter, and it's not burnt, but it's a dark caramel to me. I am also getting an almost alcohol flavor, like when someones adds too much vanilla extract to something. The description says \"Sponge cake, vanilla, caramel and a host of fruity notes ... a real labyrinth of flavours to explore forever!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- I plan on breathing this for a few hours to evaporate that hint of alcohol. This is good, but I don't think it's something I would vape stand alone. Unless this changes with a longer steep, for my personal tastes it needs some creams or custards to round it out, and I would always reach for an actual lemon cake over this.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Recommended Usage**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSingle flavor: I would probably aim for 4-6% in a tank, or 3-4% in an rda.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn a mix .75-3% depending on the recipe.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMild to Moderate\n\n**Steep**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n1 week, although I'm hoping this will smooth out a bit with more time.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**UPDATE:** At 3 week steep this is not something I will be vaping at all. The citrus notes have become very forward, and it has developed that acrid note I got from Pandoro. I can't get past the dry citrus and find any caramel left for me, still slight hints of Nonna's Cake in the background. Tastes like a mix of Pandoro, Nonna's Cake, and Custard. Not pleasant at all for me. I hope everyone else has luck with this one. I am sensitive to some flavors though, like CAP Cake Batter and FA Joy...horrid to me. So don't let my experience turn you off please.",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FA Lavender @ %1.5, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 38 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Lavender, pretty much. Just lavender. No weird off notes, just floral enough to read as lavender without being too overbearing. Good stuff.  It's like vaping Dr. Bronners Lavender Castille soap in the best possible way.\n\nInhale is obviously floral, Moderately dense, without any really thin astringency and a pleasant bitterness. Exhale opens up with a fairly strong, slightly musky lavender. A bit warmer and thicker than you'd expect from straight lavender. Pretty true lavender top notes, without a lot of \"green\" vegetal flavor.  Some really appropriate base sweetness, definitely not a \"sweet\" flavor but not distractingly thin or harsh.  Top notes linger a bit, but fairly clean. FWIW, smells pretty great. Avoids the floral rose/geranium thing where the room ends up smelling like cheap air freshener.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Not really. I'd say its a tiny bit warmer and more musky than a floral usually is, but it really helps to round out the concentrate.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light, but nothing major.  Definitely not a creamy flavor or soft flavor, but pretty good for a floral.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  More versatile than you'd think. The lack of green astringency really does open this more than other florals for mixing with creams and bakeries.  Seems a little bit musky and floral for a heavy custard base, but perfectly workable with anything whipped cream or lighter.  I'd keep it to lighter bakeries, seems like it's going to kind of sit on top of a heavier bakery.\n\nOtherwise, I'm really just going to copy what /u/HocusKrokus/ said about the concentrate (quoted in the second opinions.) Floral vanillas, green tea, and citrus. I think he's onto something with the sweeter citrus example of LA Lemonade.  I'd also include FA Lemon Sicily, JF Juicy Lemon, or even DV Sherbet Lemon.  A harsher lemon zest note is going to make the lavender a bit too sharp.\n\nIn terms of other fruit pairings, I really like lavender with blueberries. I also love it with a honey sweetness, but good luck finding a decent honey. I like FLV Honey Bee, but it's definitely a bit on the funky side. I also like it with a tiny bit of FA Violet in the background, just to kind of round out the floral note.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nConcentration testing, I think 1.5% is probably pushing it a bit. It's a tad aggressive and musky for me. I put down a sample at .5% and I definitely prefer it on the lower side.  At .5% is a little thinner, but it's less musky. Still a good lavender flavor though, and probably a lot easier to mix with at a lower level.  I'd suggest starting at .25% and working up to .75% for an lighter accent flavor. This starts to get musky at about 1%.  Maybe start there for a primary note.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[So /u/HocusKrokus/ published a really good quick guide to florals. Read it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/4t7z6g/some_notes_on_florals/)\n\n\"FA Lavender: One of my favorites. It can be a little unforgiving, and quickly goes the way of laundry soap if you use too much. Fairly sweet, and very aromatic. Pairs really well with Vanilla (not heavy cream types, but more like Vanilla classic, Vanillin, or the king of all: DIYFS Holy Vanilla) Citrus (LA Lemonade is my favorite) and Green teas. I like it best around 1.5% in a mix or 2% standalone.\"\n\n[HIC Notes:](http://mamajsflavorshop.com/headinclouds-my-notes-on-flavor-descriptions/)\n\n\"The aromatic, sweet, slightly camphor flavor of lavender plants.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FA Lychee@ %1, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 21 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  This is an interesting concentrate. Solo, it tastes a lot like grape skins, rose hips, and hairspray. Not nearly as bad as all that sounds, but definitely on the floral side of things. I've had never had fresh lychees, but the base note of this concentrate seems fairly accurate to the lychee flavor underneath all the sugar you get from canned lychee in syrup.  Strong as hell, with a pretty pronounced sweetness.  Taste is similar to FLV Lychee, but less sharp and intense, with maybe a touch more sweetness and that cool rosehip thing going on.\n\nInhale is mostly sharper florals and a solid sweetness. Little indistinct, but you definitely get some tarter non-green rosehip flavor.  Exhale has tannic, tart, grape skins right up front.  Citrusy, floral, rosehips show up a tiny bit later in the top notes. Underlying chemical hairspray taste to all of it though.  Sweet all the way through, but gets a bit sticky towards the end of the exhale. Lots of volume to the vape, but the flavor itself is a little narrow.\n \n**Off-flavors:**  Yeah, that whole hairspray thing. I think it's the tart florals that are doing it. Still pretty prominent at lower pecentages, making this stuff fairly tricky to mix with\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Moderate. That chemical note doesn't do it any favors, and the more-than-solid sweetness and the tartness together are fairly harsh.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  So pairing this, you could look toward grapes.  This flavor seems fairly similar to the more \"accurate\" style of grape concentrates.  Talk of using this with raspberries and strawberries as well.\n\nPlenty of people recommend this as a sort of general tropical sweetener for juices, and I could see that working. It's definitely on the sweet side.  I'm not a big fan of that hairspray taste to it though.\n\nI've never made anything with lychee that doesn't taste fairly lychee forward.  Keeping it light in fruit mixes should give you most of the tartness here, while contributing a good bit of sweetness to your mix.  Down low, I really do think this gives me most of what I'd want from a rose flavor without any of the nauseating (for me at least) green notes of something like FA Rose.\n\nI'd say no to prominent creams, custards, and bakeries. I'm sure it could be done but those off notes are going to be super-distracting up against any kind of dairy or dryer bakery concentrates.  You might be able to get away with something lighter like TFA Vanilla Swirl.\n\n**Notes:**  So S&V concentration testing, this stuff gets really aggressive really quickly. Tart and thin at .25%. .5% has quite a bit more body already, and that floral is already pretty well front and center. 1% is getting sticky sweet and increasingly tart. This isn't much fun at 2%, with the rosehip flavor getting more towards normal floral roses. Sweetness is overbearing and the harshness is pretty noticeable.  I'd start with this as an accent note at .25%, bumping up to .5% for use as a floral, tropical sweetener.  I don't really think you're going to get a pleasant main note out of this, but I'm pretty routinely wrong. I'd stay south of 1% though.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[So.. uhhh... here are the HIC Notes:](http://mamajsflavorshop.com/headinclouds-my-notes-on-flavor-descriptions/)\n\n\"Sweet, sweet tropical fruit flavor. It similar in flavor to dragonfruit and can make an interesting substitute or partner for it (usually requires much less!)  Try Lychee under 1% as a sweetener with an exotic fruit flavor. Lychee tastes sweet late in an exhale, which makes it especially useful; most sweet flavors don’t linger like Lychee.\"\n\n[Here's the ELR Page. Some good info besides the HIC copies.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/5103)  Pretty consistent reports about strength and sweetness.\n\n[Pretty good reviews on BCF.](http://www.bullcityflavors.com/lychee-fa/)  [And on ECX.](http://www.ecigexpress.com/diy-e-liquid/browse-flavorings/fruit-flavors/lychee-by-flavourart.html)\n\n[Plus, someone with a minion avatar of Vaping Underground says this tastes realistic.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FA Mandarin @ 2%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 35 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Bright, acidic mandarin.  This flavor takes a bit to settle in for me, it's pretty brutal for the first couple ml's. After the harshness dies a bit, I get a warm and waxy mouthfeel along with a pretty realistic mandarin flavor\n\nInhale has sharp orange zest top notes, with a warm sweetness underneath.  Exhale has a fairly sweet and realistic mandarin flavor with some higher orange zest top notes. Still getting that warmth, and the mouthfeel gets fairly waxy.  With the zest top notes and the acidity in the mandarin base, the lingering taste gets a green coffee kind of vegetal biterness.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  This gets vegetal and muddled toward the end of the exhale. It's a bit unnerving.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  This stuff is really harsh solo.  Not just the zest notes, but the whole damn thing.  I get it all, throat hit, chest tightness, some weird acidic mouthfeel.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  So contrary to everything above, I don't hate this stuff, I just find it needs some help to be pleasant. My usual go-to is a bit (like .25%) of Ethyl Maltol. It tends to soften the harshness here while making the actual citrus brightness come through a bit clearer.  A flavor heavier in maltol like the TFA Strawberries can have the same effect.  It works well in fruit mixes where it's balanced with a softer, almost syrupy counterpoint to mellow everything out.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nWorth noting that this flavor separates.  A whole lot. Give it an extra heavy shake before use. After shaking, it's cloudy.\n\nS&V concentration testing, I like this stuff pretty low. At .25-.5% you get a nice spark of brigher citrus, without a ton of the attendant waxyness or throat hit. At a lower concentration, it's definitely zest-forward. Increasing the percentage to 1%, you get more of that tangerine base but the throat hit is right behind.  I find the waxyness and the warmness really starts to come in at 1.5%, and by 2% it's a bit of a mess to me.  I'd personally mix with this at .5% for a hit of citrus zest, and up towards 1.5% in a mix where you want the actual tangerine and have something in there to mellow out the harshness.\n\nAll in all, not a bad flavor but it has some serious structural issues.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[HIC notes:](http://mamajsflavorshop.com/headinclouds-my-notes-on-flavor-descriptions/)\n\n\"Like a fresh mandarin tangerine, not the canned ones floating in bland syrup. If you prefer a 'Cutie' to a navel orange, you'll like this flavor. It mixes great with Fresh Cream, Vanilla Classic, Vanilla Tahiti, and/or Custard to make Creamsicle type flavors. Try it in place of Orange or as an accent for Orange in any recipe to add interest. It will sometimes taste like orange zest if used as a tiny accent for other citrus flavors.\"\n\n[Some tangerine discussion.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/3jvu22/best_tangerine_concentrate/)\n\n[Creamsicle recipe by EnyaWreklaw using this up at 3%](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/3666bd/sicle_an_orange_creamsicle_flavor_with_a_touch_of/)  Uses FA Orange as a backup, which seems to the play.\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)** ",

    "markdown": "**Setup:** OG Recoil w/ flavor barrel, n80 Dual fused claptons @.30 ohms. 55 watts. Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Flavourart Mango Indian Special @ 1 and 3%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 1 week.\n\n**Profile:**  Bright mango, leaning toward candy.  Good balance of brighter almost citrus notes up top with a sweet and robust middle.  Lingering pineapple gummy exhale.  Brighter and less juicy than an “authentic” mango.  Artificial, but in a good candy mango way.  Bottom end seems a bit lacking, and couple probably stand some bolstering or other misdirection for a “full” mango. \n\n**Off-Flavors:**  Remarkably few? At 3%, some bitter astringency sort of approaching a “peel” note.  Closer to a grassy, rather than typical pine note. Slightly dry.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Nothing too crazy for a fruit, at least for me.  Not wholly smooth, but the brighter citrus-y notes are relatively manageable. I could see having a slight issue if your throat has particularly delicate sensibilities. \n\n**Percentage Recommendation:**  1% seems a bit soft overall.  The flavor there is good, but It doesn’t   feel all that fleshed out.  Seems pretty linear up to 3%, where those slightly grassy peel notes pick up.  So maybe 2% for something DTL?  Preferably with something deep and juicy to pick up the bottom end. \n\n**Other Resources:**\n\n[The Product Page](https://flavourart.com/en/store/aromi-new-en/aromi-fruttati-new-en/mango-indian-special-flavor/)\n\n[“All The Flavors” Page](https://alltheflavors.com/flavors/flavourart-mango-indian-special)\n\n[“e-Liquid Recipes” Page](https://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/314413)\n\n*I paid for this.*\n\n\n\n\nThought experiment: Imagine that [TPA Philippine Mango](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/5rcupz/tfa_philippine_mango/) was good, actually?\n\nA steaming hot flavor take.  For you.  The aggrieved flavor dork.\n\nTPA Philippine Mango is… underwhelming.  A flat, plastic candy flavor.  I say candy not to slander, especially not in the case of mango candy.  Mango candy is delicious!  As someone located far away from the production of mangoes, they can be profoundly disappointing.  Sublime occasionally, garbage more frequently.  Mango candy produces a reliable flavor, which is beyond the grasp of modern supply chain management. \n\nThis flavor reminds me of a quality mango candy flavor.  Bright and just a little tart with a deep sweetness to it.  The top end has a nice pop of lemon and tangerine tartness.  I can see it being a bit harsh if you’re especially sensitive to throat hit, but overall it’s manageable.  The mango flavor is fairly saturated to the point of tasting a bit artificial, with some papaya type overtones and a lingering pineapple gummy candy on the exhale.\n\nI give Flavourart full credit here, because the mango taste is definitely closer to an alphonso mango than the more typical underwhelming green/red hard as rock mangoes I’m used to finding in an american grocery store.\n\nThe more remarkable thing about this flavor is the relative lack of the unpleasant notes common in other mango flavors.\n\nI’m not getting anything that shouts “pine” here, and that is good! We have mango flavors that offer pine.  I’m good without more pine.  There are some grassier, drier peel notes at higher percentages, but I wouldn’t expect them to be an issue with judicious use.  1% was too weak for me, and 3% was too aggressive.  Mixing those samples, thereby netting 2%, was very pleasant.  This also doesn’t taste overripe for me, which is good!\n\nMy one big structural critique here would be relative lack of bottom end to it. I feel like it could be deeper and juicier for a full mango flavor.  Some backing FLV Mango compliments this really well. If you’re creating a recipe with a creamier base, this is probably about all the mango you’d need. \n\nI enjoyed this!  And it beats the prior FA Mango (Costarica Special) heartily.\n\n[The Reddit DIY Flavor Review Archive](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)",

I would describe this as somewhere *between* a sweet pink grapefruit and a dark cherry or light blueberry.  Very unique taste and slightly sharp on the tongue.\n\nOff-flavors: Gets a bit floral above 2 or 3%, but fades after a decent steep.\n\nThroat hit: 6/10\n\nUses: Great for a summer time or tropical mix.  Could also be used to give boring or tart fruit flavors an sweet boost without over-powering a blend.  This could also possibly be used in a pinch to mimic some of the juiciness of INW Cactus at very low percentages, but it is definitely not the same thing by any means, especially once you compare the two flavors over 1-2%.\n\nPairings: Tropical flavors.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FA @ Maple Syrup %2, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 8 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Fairly dry maple-flavored sugar, mouthfeel is too gritty for a syrup. Maple flavor is nice and warm, but a bit closer to a pancake syrup rather than actual maple syrup, but pretty accurate overall.\n\nInhale is moderately dense and dry sweetness.  Exhale starts strong with that maple in the middle and kind of migrates into the top notes as the exhale go on. Sweetness really comes in on the back of the exhale right as the vape gets flat and dry, so the overall effect is a lot like gritty sugar with maple top notes.  Warm and sort of floral but not-really. A whole lot like vanilla that way. Not quite as round and cloying as something like a pancake syrup, but not as complex as real maple syrup.  The maple here can taste a little astringent solo. A lot of volume, but a drier density.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Dry/gritty mouthfeel solo.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Light to moderate on the exhale solo, mostly because of the dry gritty texture.  Haven't noticed an issue in a juicier or creamier mixes.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Maple is one of those flavors that is pretty easy to pick out in a mix, so anything you pair it with is probably going going to have a pretty identifiable maple note. With that said, it's a nice warm flavor that's not quite a spice and not quite a floral, a lot like vanilla.  Also like vanilla, this is going to have a lot of pairings.\n\nIn terms of fruits, apples are the one that jumps out immediately. Should also work well with pears. I'd stay away from brighter fruits like grapes, berries in general, and kiwi as well as tropical fruits like mango or pineapple.  Works really well with coconut though.\n\nObvious breakfast kind of vibe with your bakeries, but will punch up pies when the filling is appropriate. You can use this as a sweetener for apple, pumpkin, or even the elusive sweet potato pie recipe to add some warmth and depth.  Also works well with oats in real life, so maybe an oatmeal raisin profile as well.\n\nMixes well with your traditional holiday spice flavorings like cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and clove. Also works really well vanilla.\n\nNatural fit with whiskey's as well. [u/xxsirx/ posted a recipe in the FA Whisky thread that uses cap's maple, and it hits a ton of these pairings.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/recipe/848721/Brad%20The%20Vapist%27s%20Drift%20Wood%20%28D%20Series%29)\n\nWorks well with heavier creams and custards.  Probably going to have to be a primary note, but pretty damned tasty.\n\nLastly, should pair well with tobacco, assuming that you are after that in your blend. This will sweeten a mix considerably, so watch for that.  Also sort of related, flavor will complement nuttier, roastier mixes but you'll have to watch the overall dryness.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nS&V Concentration testing, starting at .25% I don't get much at all. Maybe a slight maple taste, but I'm mostly just tasting the pg in my test mix.  .5% has a watery, astringent maple tinge but no real body or sweetness.  Sweetness is starting to creep in at 1%, and it feels like a full maple note at 1.5%.  Sweetness gets a bit grainy by 2% but that maple note is still filling out and getting a bit richer. Maple seems pretty topped out by 2.5% and that mouthfeel is getting a little distracting. 3%, it's started to get solidly dry and gritty.  4% solo is just falling apart and reading as really scratchy sugar with a more bitter maple note.\n\nI've read a lot of talk about this being super strong, and I don't really get it. It doesn't strike me as all that aggressive. My taste buds seem to be largely intact, so I'm not sure what the disconnect is. I purchased my bottle from ECX within the last 6 months, so who knows? Weak batch, different formulation maybe?  Or maybe I'm just missing something.  I've had this at 4% in /u/thattswhatshesaid 's [Oaked](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/recipe/1009739/Oaked) (also a great example of using this with a rich, creamy base) and loved it, so It can be definitely be done. Oaked was a /r/mixersclub submission and none of the feedback complained about the maple being out of whack there.  Based on this testing, I'd suggest starting at 1.0% as a mixer for fruit, tobacco, or whiskey and about 3% with a thick, creamy or custard base.  So, I guess YMMV. Maybe start lower than that and work up, most people suggest this at .25% to work in conjunction with other sweeteners like Caramel, Honey, or Butterscotch.\n\nMaple is a tricky flavor.  It's a nice change of pace for me, but I hit flavor satiation really quick with it. I kind of enjoy it up until the moment I don't and there isn't much of a grace period there.  I suspect a lot of people are the same way, so I guess keep that in mind in your recipe development. Also, it does make a room smell like maple syrup... so if you're into /u/ID10-T 's (patent pending) seduction via scented cloud technique, this deserves some serious consideration.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[ELR notes have some useful bits among the copies of the HIC Notes.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/299)\n\nUser vahrheit notes:  \"lovely maple note @ 4% , a bit too dry, could use a creamy partner.

    "markdown": "###My Notes on FlavourArt's Muhr-En-Gay\n\n\nI wanted to write a little post about this ingredient. I'm sure everyone knows what this flavor is, does, and how it works. It's extremely popular and for good reason. IMO it's one of FlavourArt's best and most useful ingredients. There isn't a recipe where I thought \"maybe some meringue won't help it\". So I figured why not type something up that'll help someone who hasn't been graced by the presence of this immaculate fluid. \n\n---\n\n**FLAVOR PROFILE**\n\n* Originating in the Swiss (or Italy depending who you ask) meringue is a confection consisting of beaten egg whites, sugar, and sometimes the essence of another flavor like vanilla or lemon. It's created by beating egg whites until they create a soft peak and then adding white sugar and continued beating until it's a stiff peak and then baked at a low temp. What you get is a light and flaky crust with somewhat of a marshmallow middle that's neither too sweet nor too plain. The shit melts in your fuckin mouth and it tastes so bomb with desserts, pies, chocolates, or even by themselves.  \n\n* What FlavourArt does is try to mimic the meringues outer layer with flavor, and they do a pretty bang on job. It's light, airy, somewhat crispy, and if you use a bit more, you end up with that marshmallow middle ype flavor that's creamy, velvety, and luxurious. What FA does particularly well with this flavor is mimicking the sugar content found in meringue. It's a perfect white sugar flavor that leaves its mark on your palate after the entire flavor is consumed. \n\n**USES**\n\n* FA did a great job of allowing Meringue to be used exactly as its authentic counterpart would be used.  This is no simple feat as the flavor is light and airy, and even when added to heavy recipes like thick creams or demanding desserts, you can still pull out Meringue's feather like qualities. It's something that as a mixer is fucking impressive. \n\n* In your recipes, any time you need a light white sugar note think about using FA Meringue. I guarantee you it will fit in perfectly in 90% of your recipes. So recipes that are creamy with some kind of fruit note, like a strawberry cream, blueberry cream, peaches and cream, FA Meringue is a great fit. Lifting the sweetness of the cream, the fruit, and whatever side notes you're using all at the same time, while not adding any unnecessary weight to the mix. This allows you to fine tune your creams with the other ingredients until they are a perfect weight for you. Start low, as with any ingredient, and work your way up. **1% is a great middle of the road concentration when using Meringue in this manner, but don't start there.**\n\n* Substituting for Marshmallow is great as well for any recipes you find the marshmallow's flavor just isn't coming out. This happens a lot with certain desserts where the accompanying flavors are just too much for FA Marshmallow, or TFA Marshmallow to handle. Meringue does a good job of giving you that mallow-like flavor and feel. **I suggest using a lower percentage at first, like 0.5% and seeing how much more marshmallow flavor you're going to need from there**. It's not a 1:1 substitution though, so if a recipe demands the flavor of a marshmallow to mimic its real life model, this might not be the best choice and in that case FA/TFA Marshmallow would be a better choice.\n\n* Cereals benefit immensely with the addition of FA Meringue. So much so I often never see a cereal recipe without FA Meringue in it. Giving credit where credit is due, Jackster was one of the first (if not the first) to use meringue perfectly in this situation. Spawning off hundreds of different cereals all riffing off his idea of using Meringue as a \"milk\". Myself included as you can see in both my Cereal Milks and Cereal Marshmallow Strawberry Milk recipes where I use Meringue as not only the central focus but the entire foundation of the recipes. **Using Meringue around 1-2% will give you that sweet milky quality you're looking for**. TLDR, meringue is the PERFECT cereal milk flavor. Just fucking smell it and tell me you don't smell cereal milk.\n\n* Chocolates are something I've been playing around with more frequently. I've found that Meringue helps bring the body of the chocolates out while also lifting sweetness that is rather lacking from most chocolate flavorings. **Using it at around 0.5% is the perfect amount to give your chocolates for of a \"waxy sheen\" to them**.  \n\n* The steep on Meringue is quite short. To get the absolute full flavor from this concentrate you only need to let your mixes sit for a full day or two. This makes mixing with it extremely fun as you're not waiting a week to make any tweaks or changes to your recipes. The vape from this is great as well and can take on the form and texture of any flavorings you pair with it. Like in my Rhodonite recipe where I use it in conjunction with Torrone to give an almost \"powdery\" white sugar effect that sticks on your lips. \n \n\nThere are ENDLESS ways you can use this ingredient. This is just the tip of the iceberg. I've recently been fiddling around with using Meringue to bring Peanut Butter out. It's an extremely useful ingredient and I think it deserves a spot in every mixers arsenal, old and new. Hopefully someone will think this info is useful and that it will help anyone considering ordering it to just do it already. Your recipes are begging you to add some Meringue in. KEEP MIXING!\n\n**If you liked this post don't forget to check my website where I post them up all the time at www.diyordievaping.com**\n\n",

It has a background of generic fruitiness.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- I don't get \"crispy\" cake flavor, and it's lightly sweetened, reminds me strongly of angel food cake topped with light citrus cream. The description says citrus, but there is no acidity to me at all like I usually get with citrus, it's very smooth. I can't taste any one dominant citrus at all, nothing stands out, just a refreshing blend that is very well balanced and doesn't bury the cake. No tanginess or sharp flavors at all. Very familiar tasting, but I can't quite put my finger on it.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- It's a very good cake, I will be interested to see how this changes if at all with a 4 week steep. Overall a light flavor.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Recommended Usage**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSingle flavor: I would probably aim for 6-7% in a tank, or 4-5% in an rda.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn a mix 1-4% depending on the recipe.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Steep**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n1 week, although I think this will get better with more.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**UPDATE** At a 3 week steep the crispy cake flavor has really come out, still lightly sweet and creamy/moist. It changes a lot with the longer steep, really transforms into a heavier, more dense cake. This really tastes like a fried old fashioned cake doughnut without glaze. It still has a very very slight hint of generic citrus in the background. It really adds to the doughnut, gives it that very slight sourdough/sour cream background note. I am really enjoying this as a SF. I'm thinking a small amount of either FA Meringue or Marshmallow (maybe a little of both) will give it a great sugary glaze :) If you want the lighter angel food cake effect like in a Strawberry Shortcake, I wouldn't make more than a week's worth at a time.",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FA Monsoon, 1 and 2.5%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 7 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Flavourart's description of this flavor is pretty lofty... \"Be blown away with dark spicy Tobacco...Imagine the Monsoon wind racing over the ocean to the rain forest, twisting and turning through groves of fruit trees, slowing to absorb the sweet freshness before laying itself gently across a field of Vanilla, relaxing and savouring nature's gifts. Such was the inspiration behind our new flavour, Monsoon, a polyhedral celebration of gentle, floral fruits set on a cushion of soft sweetness.\"  Okay.\n\nThe fruit in here seems to be the star.  I get mostly orange, cherry, and some darker sweeter base that feels a lot like a fig or maybe even a date flavor. The orange is on the sweeter, less zest heavy side.  Almost a candied orange as opposed to a candy orange flavor, if that makes any sense. The cherry isn't necessarily medicinal, but it has a weird kind of phenolic just vaguely playdough off note.  There is a darker, sweeter fruit edge to this that feels fairly cooked. I'm not 100% on whether it's a discrete flavor or just an effect from a modifier, but it makes the entire thing taste a bit darker and richer than you'd think orange and cherry would taste. This doesn't really taste like it has much tobacco in there.  You can almost feel it in the mouthfeel, but I can't taste any kind of tobacco leave or ashy notes here. It's sort of like TPA RY4 Double in that way, the \"tobacco\" is more of a warm dryness.  The overall effect is a lot like the fruits out of a fruitcake: heavy, syrupy, and with a darker kind of sweetness.  The second opinions talk about a cake note on the back end but I'm not really getting that.  If it is in there, it feels like it's being drowned out by all that fruit going on.  I do get some light vanilla on the exhale, but it feels very much like an accent to that fruit.  It's sweet for a flavourart flavor, and seems like a good fit as a solo flavor if the profile is intriguing to you.  I also think it could stand a good hit of a dark, aggressive tobacco.  I'd mix this around 3%.\n\nInhale is mostly fruit. Deeper, sweeter orange without much of a zest note. Some dark cherry sweetness building through the inhale.  Sweet for flavourart, with a moderate density. Some dry, slightly warm throat hit.  Exhale starts of with a bit of space where it feels like the tobacco should go. No real tobacco taste, but it feels like a tobacco throat hit. Could just be the placebo effect from the description, but it seems to fit. Fruit comes in shortly after that. Exhale is a lot heavier on the cherry than the inhale. Cherry note is darker and sweet, almost like a brandied cherry. Phenolic top notes off the cherry. Sweet, mellow orange flavor in there as well.  Entire fruit note has a really appealing dark sweetness to it. There is just a hint of vanilla on the back end.  Very light, and a little bit fluffy. Exhale finishes clean. \n\n**Off-flavors:**  I'm pretty sure that phenolic note is coming off the cherry here. Feels a bit like an oversaturated marzipan flavor. Not too aggressive or off-putting, but noticeable.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Moderate. It feels like there should be a darker tobacco based on the throat hit.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Probably best approached a solo flavor.  There is a whole lot going on here, and it seems to have a bit more body and sweetness than some of the other complex FA flavors.\n\nIf you want to chance it, I feel like this could a heavier hand with whatever light tobacco note may or may not be here. I'd go for a dark pipe tobacco like INW Black for pipe.\n\nYou could also play with adding some cake to this flavor and accentuating whatever cake finish other reviewers are picking up.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, this is actually surprisingly linear for something this complex. At .5% this feels light and unsaturated. Nothing wrong with it, but I feel like it needs more concentration. 1% is largely the same. A less complicated orange-ish cherry flavor without much of that syrupy sweetness or nuance. At 1.5%, the cherry is really starting to show through and I'm getting a hint of that almond-y phenolic note. Mouthfeel is also getting that tobacco vibe. 2% is pretty well balanced, but still just a bit less sweet than I'd like. Phenolic note is a touch stronger, but not overwhelming and the mouthfeel is getting more interesting. At 3% I'm getting most of what I want out of this flavor. The mouthfeel is interesting, fruit is heavy, dark, and sweet, and that vanilla on the backend is a little clearer.  That weird note of the cherry is getting to be a bit much though. At 4% that cherry off-note is getting gross.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Here is the ELR Page.  The web page where HIC's flavor notes were hosted appears to be gone from this world... but thankfully they live on through ELR. \"This is a bit stronger than most FA flavors, so try 2 - 2.5% first. Around 3% produces afragrant vapor trail, like fruity incense, so start low. Right after mixing you’ll taste mostly sugary-sweet, bright fruits, a tutti-frutty mix of cherries, candied orange peel, perhaps papaya, and others that come and go. By a day or two after mixing, a background flavorof vanilla cake (like white wedding cake) gains strength, and the fruits mellow. Monsoon is among FA’s sweetest flavors, excellent standalone - complex, sweet, and unique. It really needs nothing added to taste complete. Monsoon is prominent in recipes - even under 1%; be sure to try it standalone a while before mixing with it.\"](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/65575)  Random side note, HIC's notes are still available via an optional donation and download.

User \"Cooper\" wrote: \"When I first got this flavor I mixed it at 10% and it turned out very good, but odd. I was expecting a tobacco flavor with a hint of fruit, but that's not what I got. I let some of my friends taste it and I'm still getting multiple different descriptions; one said it taste like cherry on inhale and banana on exhale, another said it had some floral notes (like vaping rosewater) and I think it resembles strawberries and cream.\"  10% might be overkill, but I feel like this is going to be more subjective than most.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FA Morning Sun, 1 and 2.5%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 5 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  FlavourArt calls this \"A milky flavour carefully blended with the sweetness of freshly cut fruit ... the perfect continental all day breakfast!\" I definitely get some kind of cream component here.  It doesn't have a strong diary note, more of a flat sweet cream with a heavier body to it. There's a lighter pastry note in here.  It's a bit soft next to that cream, but there is almost puff pastry taste on the back end of that cream.  There is definitely some sort of fruit as well, but it's pretty well blended with the cream and nothing really calls attention to it.  I've tasted melon, berries, and peach in here while vaping.  Not sure what's supposed to be in there, but there's a dry floral edge to the fruit note.  It's a very well done, cohesive take on a full profile but it feels a bit too busy, and a bit too light.  It's a decent single flavor if you want something lighter, but this could easily be accented with creams, heavier bakeries, or brighter fruits.  Seems to get a bit too floral at higher percentages, I'd mix with this around 2%.\n\nInhale is hard to pick apart, but I'm getting mostly cream. Fairly dense body, but a lighter flavor to it. Not a lot of dairy or richness but a thick, smooth texture. Theres a light, soft bakery edge to this that really creeps in as the inhale goes on. Some vaguely fruity sweetness, but fairly mellow.  Sharper floral top notes, pretty noticeable at higher percentages. Exhale opens up on that creamy pastry. The weight of the cream and the softness of the bakery note kind of melt together. Fruit comes in after that.  There's a floral note up high, and the fruit itself is definitely some kind of fruit mix without too many sharp edges that call attention to themselves. I do get a bit of melon, I think.  There's a touch of recognizable melon rind in here.  I want to say it's a honeydew, but it's not too distinct. There's also some red berry sweetness in here. Not sure if it's a strawberry or raspberry, but there's a floral component that feels like it belongs to a berry.  I'm also getting some heavier kind of peachy sweetness. Some lingering floral notes, and a bit of dry chalkiness on the tail end of the exhale.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Not 100% sure what's supposed to be here, but the fruit has some solid floral notes to it.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Moderate.  This has a bit of traditional harshness and a sharp, floral edge.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  If you're into lighter, delicate flavors and don't mind some florals this is a pretty decent single flavor around 2-2.5%.  Cream, pastry, and fruit all in there but it's a bit unsatisfying.\n\nUsing this in mixes, I think this could be taken in a couple different directions based on what you want to accentuate. That cream note could stand some bolstering with either FLV Cream or FA Fresh Cream.  I could also see taking in a yogurt direction.  The pastry note would be a decent base for something with a bit more AP to give a more solid bakery component. This could definitely use some additional brighter stronger fruit as well.\n\nThis tastes light and sort of generic enough to thicken up fruit and cream recipes with that heavy mouthfeel without completely dominating a mix.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, .25% and .5% are definitely on the light side.  At 1% I get mostly the cream and pastry out of this. There is some fruitiness to it, but nothing all that specific or defined. At 1.5% fruit is starting to pick up a bit, still in the background but seems more like a discrete component.  At 2% I'm getting more nuance from the fruit but it's getting a bit floral.  At 2.5% fruit sweetness is coming through but that floral note is more pronounced. At 3% is maybe a bit too floral for me, and at 4% it's gets downright perfumey.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Here's the ELR Page.  User \"Amy***\" writes: \"Starts off as a strong condensed milk then mellows into a sweeter cream that turns into a fruit blend of mixed fruit I want to think there is mandarin hard to discern the fruit profiles very light and not candy sweet just right.

We suggest using 2-4%\" http://flavourart.com/en/store/resellers/custom-mix/nonna-cake-en/\n\nI mixed it up at 3% as I figured that would be a good middle ground for an FA flavor. Most of us usually use FA anywhere from .5-4%. I mixed it at 70vg and 3mg nicotine just as I would any other mix. \n\n(3/23/16) Fresh - Lemon cake.

I suppose more bakery or cake notes come through. Fuck this lemon though. Pretty gross so far. \n\n7 days - Much more enjoyable, some of the lemon has faded and more cake comes through. Still very synthetic and not what I was hoping for. \n\nToday - I haven't had much desire to taste this further since it's been a let down. But today, after 12 days it's a much better vape.

It would have been so popular, and it may still be. But, for me this sucks. I don't know what it is with Italians and their lemon deserts, but I feel as if they totally screwed this one up.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FA Ozone, 1 and 2.5%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 9 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** This is weird, even for flavourart.  Their description is just \"A full bodied background that blends well with delicate floreal top notes. Light on vape but with personality,\" but they have it in their tobacco flavor category.  Solo, it mostly just tastes like wet hay smells, with a heavy sweetness at higher percentages.  It's not quite \"grassy\" per se.  It's a bit hard to describe but it's unmistakably hay.  It's not quite floral, but it has that hay top note, and nothing much beneath it but a slightly dry mouthfeel and a deep sweetness.  The sweetness itself is fairly hard to describe, because it's sweet in a way that doesn't really correlate to any kind of sugar or sweetener taste.  It's sweeter in the way that lukewarm water tastes sweeter than cold water although it takes on a light caramel or maple tinge up at 2.5%.  I taste zero tobacco in here. Through the power of bad inductive reasoning and reading reviews, this seems like a dead ringer for coumarin.\n\n**Off-flavors:** I don't even know where to start.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Moderate. Kind of weirdly harsh and dry on the throat while still having that watery sweetness.\n\n**Additive Testing:** Because this seems like pretty much an additive, I've done some super scientific testing with it mixed with a couple of other flavors.  These samples have been steeped for 3 days.\n\n*FLV Sweet Cigarette 2%, FA Ozone 1%-* This is actually making the sweet cigarette flavor distressingly accurate.  It's giving it a drier and smoother body and really pushing up the ashy note here and adding some sweetness. The wet hay flavor folds itself almost seamlessly into the bitter tobacco leaf note here. This may have some serious use to increase realism in tobacco vapes without having to go straight to ashtray additives like INW Dirty Neutral Base.\n\n*FLV Pineapple 2%, FA 1%-*  This is definitely doing something here, beyond just putting another flavor into the mix.  I'm just not sure it's wholly pleasant. This has taken the juicier FLV Pineapple, and made it taste a whole lot like you're actually scraping chunks of pineapple flesh off the peel with your teeth.  It's dried out the pineapple substantially and given the entire thing a greenness that actually does a peel note here pretty admirably.  Small detail that you don't actually eat pineapple peels, but its at least technically impressive. It may help lend some realism to brighter, syrupy fruit flavors.  I could see it doing a mango peel really well.\n\n**Notes:**  Based on the additive testing, I'd say this is mostly a tobacco enhancer and 1% seems way too high.  I'd probably aim for something closer to .5% there. Use outside of that is going to be really niche and primarily with fruits.  I'd start crazy low there, like .1% and work up until it gets too weird.  Coumarin is also a direct precursor to coumadin which, along with medical uses as a blood thinner, is a pretty traditional rat poison.  So you can probably also use this as a training device to recognize when someone is trying to poison you.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nThe research on this got incredibly weird.  It all started off innocuously enough with the [sole review on BCF.](http://www.bullcityflavors.com/ozone-fa/)  An unknown user posted: \"This stuff tastes like coumarin, with hints of a few other ingredients. Good enhancer for pipe or hand-rolling tobacco flavors. Also surprisingly good with fruits.\"  Sounded like a good starting point, so I googled.  [Entertainingly, the second result for \"coumarin tobacco\" is a tripod webpage that's either designed by someone woke AF about southerners trying to poison the north after the civil war, or a complete crazy person.](http://medicolegal.tripod.com/coumarin.htm)  But, on the [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coumarin) for coumarin it does say that courmarin \"has a sweet odor, readily recognised as the scent of newly-mown hay... Coumarin has been used as an aroma enhancer in pipe tobaccos.\"  So it seems to fit.  This probably tastes like coumarin.  Thanks \"unknown\"!\n\nI don't feel so bad about ripping off those [downloadable HIC notes](http://www.hicsmixes.com/notes-etc.html) for this: \"The distinct aroma and flavor of dried celery seeds(!)\n\n[Here's the ELR Page. User \"docta\" starts talking about complexity I just don't get.  This just tastes like hay, basically. They do bring up head shops, and I could totally see this at a higher percentage tasting a lot like a slightly woody incense.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/3142)\n\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**\n\n[Bonus, incredibly rambling, video first test of FA Monsoon, Storm, Ozone, and Reggae Night.

    "markdown": "**Setup:** Recoil w/ flavor barrel, Dual 15 wrap 26g 3mm Nifethal 70 coils @.17 ohms.  60w power, 450F temp limit. Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FA Passionfruit @ 1%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 31 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  A super bright and fairly acidic passionfruit.  Tastes an awful lot like a vaguely tropical version of FA White Peach to me.  After vaping about 5ml at 1% this flavor starts to mellow out for me, with those peachy kind of notes really starting to push toward the front.\n\nInhale tastes like sour white peaches. Relatively thin, floral, sharp, and fairly harsh. Sweetness level is good, but overall it's pretty acidic.  Exhale has a burst of peach and strawberry top notes right up front, with a natural tasting sweet and sour base. Flavor separates on the exhale, with floral peach top notes, a tart green sourness, and that a deeply sweet base.  The sour acidity is the defining characteristic for me, although those high peach notes linger and turn a bit bitter. Overall effect is fairly soapy while being moderately dense.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  So, the few times I've had passionfruit in a less-processed form it actually does fairly soapy. It's not really off from the profile,  taste but I don't find it pleasant. Its like a coating of the original blue Dawn on your rda. It's odd.\n\n**Throat Hit:** I'm not going to quite call it razor blades, but it's pretty harsh solo. Something about the acidity and the thin soapiness gets hard to handle, especially on the inhale.  It also feels acidic enough that it tears my mouth up a bit.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This stuff makes a good stand-in for a \"sour\" flavor in fruit mixes. It's less destructive than something like straight malic acid, but it still has that bracing sour note that will complement brighter fruits.\n\nGood mixer for tropical fruits, strawberries, peaches, and melons at a lower percentage.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nS&V Concentration testing, I get a lighter, floral sour peach flavor at .25%. Still some throat hit, but that green sour flavor is pretty well balanced.  at .5% I'm getting quite a bit more of that sourness, and that floral peach is about the same as it was at .25%. At .75%, the sweetness and juiciness is starting to show up, although I'm getting a distinct sour vibe that hasn't gone full acidic.  1% is starting to soapy as those floral notes get bitter.  1.5% is getting acidic and harsh for me, and by 2% most of what I'm getting is harsh, sour, sweetness.  Personally, I'd mix with this as a supporting flavor at .75% and call it good.\n\nI picked this flavor up a while ago, and promptly written it off due to that throat hit. Chapel's [Deep Passion](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/26777#deep_passion_by_chapel) made me take another look at this flavor.  Because, like most other people, I know everything ever and I couldn't imagine how that recipe was working with 2.5% of passionfruit right up front.  So I tried, and by god it works. I still feel like the mix leans a bit harsh but the CAP Fig and FA Caramel do a great job of balancing out the bright astringency from this concentrate.  It's great stuff, and I think it illustrates the way forward using this as a primary note.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[ELR Notes are mostly copies of HIC notes:](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/4966)\n\n\"If you like tropical fruit flavors, you need this one. It’s sweet and exotic, and it combines well with all of FA’s tropical fruits. If you already have tropical fruit blends without this flavor, use 0.5-1% Passion Fruit in place of part of your other tropical fruits for an almost guaranteed improvement.\n\nPassion Fruit is excellent with Papaya. If you use Passion Fruit as a main flavor, consider an accent of Black Currant. If you have a citrus recipe in need of something special, try adding 1% or less Passion Fruit. It’s good with most citrus, especially tasty with orange and peach flavors.\"\n\n[I know I linked it already, but take a look at the notes on passionfruit in Chapel's Deep Passion.](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/26777#deep_passion_by_chapel)  They seem to be finding a lot more utility with this than I can.\n\n\"Not a ton of mixers use this flavor, but it is incredibly versatile, blending well with teas, creams, and lots of other fruits. An Exotic fruit, it is bright and sweet but has a bit of an acidic edge.\"\n\nI'm not getting the cream thing, and I think it's a bit sour for a tea with any kind of citrus involved, but it's worth noting that this is probably a lot more versatile than I give it credit for.\n\n[So at the very least, there is some agreement that this is strong stuff.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/3f493f/anyone_have_experience_with_passionfruit/)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)** ",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FA Pomegranate, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 6 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Darkly sweet with a bit of tartness, almost a pomegranate syrup. No higher floral notes or real sharp brightness but manages to capture some of the astringency of actual pomegranate.\n\nInhale is deep, sryupy sweetness. Definitely a pomegranate taste. I get some bitter floral top notes there too, but nothing unpleasant. Exhale has a dark, syrupy pomegranate right down the middle. I get just a hint of an almost cheesy coconut kind of sweetness.  It's really subtle though, and it could be something in this is just bringing that note out of the VG.  I don't get anything too floral in the top notes, although they pick up a bit of pomegranate astringency on the back half of the exhale. That astringency is light and totally in the profile, but it has a camphor effect. Dense mouthfeel, with a bit of wax to it.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  The tart astringency here has a camphor effect. It's not major but it's a bit distracting. I also get a really subtle kind of cheesiness to the fruit sweetness here. It's definitely mild, but it's following me as I tried a couple setups, so it's definitely there.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  I don't get a lot of throat hit here, seems fairly smooth to me.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Dark berries for sure. Something like FA Bilberry is going to bring back in some of the earthy astringency I'd want from a more realistic pomegranate.  Also a good excuse to use some FA Blackcurrant to play off the tartness here.\n\nVersatile mixer, while adding just a hint of mystery to a fruit mix.  Hard to place, but rarely unpleasant. I like it with mint and apple, but really it'll go with damn near anything.\n\nBakeries or creams might be a bit tricky. I'm not sure that camphor note is going to play all that nicely, but I've certainly been wrong about that kind of thing before.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nS&V concentration testing, .25-.75% is light but fairly bright, tart, and just a bit floral. Most of the secret sauce from the pomegranate, without a lot of body. 1% starts to get sweet and syrupy, but still fairly balanced. 1.5% picks up some that camphor, but the sweetness is still increasing it's pretty nice overall. 2% is getting pretty strong, with the off-notes starting to show up. 2.5% is getting a bit medicinal, and 3% is reading almost cough-dropish.  I'd mix with this at .75% as an accent note and 1.5% as a primary note in a fruit mix.\n\nAll in all, really good stuff.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[HIC Notes:](http://mamajsflavorshop.com/headinclouds-my-notes-on-flavor-descriptions/)\n\n\"Like fresh pomegranate, this is both sweet and tart, with a hint of the bitterness of the actual fruit. This is a very authentic flavor that will stand out in most recipes. It blends well with all the dark fruit and berry flavors. Orange makes a good sweetener. Lime and Coconut contrast well.\"\n\nGood, fairly useless reviews on [BCF](http://www.bullcityflavors.com/pomegranate-fa/) and [ECX](http://www.ecigexpress.com/diy-e-liquid/browse-flavorings/fruit-flavors/pomegranate-by-flavourart.html)\n\n[Here's the FOTW on Pomegranate.

It's not an artificial food-dye color, but more of a natural hue of green, something resembling a plant (duh). This is probably one of few colored flavorings I've seen (aside from the obvious chocolate). However, I feel I need to mention that the color goes away after mixing it with VG, PG and nicotine.\n\nIt's also important to note that the coloring might be an isolated incident as few mixers have said their FA peppermint looks clear.\n\nFirst few sniffs offer a very fresh smelling scent. It reminds me of those red and white peppermint candies you can get during Christmas. It's a little bit sweet and there's also a touch of cream. \n\n**Taste:**\n\nThis is spot-on peppermint candy! I get the sweetness on the tip of tongue followed by a hint of creamy goodness. However, the mint is on the mild side that it's almost non-existent. For fans of mint and menthol, you definitely need to add other flavorings such as FA Spearmint, TFA Menthol and TFA Koolada to get that back-of-the-throat chilling sensation that you enjoy.\n\n**Standalone/Mixer:**\n\nI thoroughly enjoy this as a standalone, however I believe this flavoring truly shines when it's complemented with other flavors. You could definitely make a delicious chocolate mint with this. Maybe a vanilla mint cream. Or even a Wrigley's gum if you lean that way. The possibilities are endless.\n\n**Pairings**\n\nFruits, desserts, chocolate, candy. You could add this in small amounts to brighten up a dull mix. \n\n**Is it 4oz-worthy?**\n\nWell, it's relative. If you enjoy mints, menthol and things of that nature, you will definitely want to pick up a bottle of this.\n\n**Recipe:**\n\nI got inspired by DB Liquids rendition of a vanilla mint cream.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FA Raspberry @ 2%. 60/40 VG/PG, steeped 10 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** A pretty full raspberry. Relatively good balance between top notes, slight tartness, and darker candy sweetness. No single part of this concentrate is fantastic, but the balance here helps to make it slightly better than the sum of it's parts.  I like this more than some people, so I guess check the second opinions out here.\n\nInhale has some sharper floral top notes, with a pretty accurate but slightly syrupy deeper sweetness. Moderately dense, and a little warmer than you'd expect.  Exhale has the same kind of floral top notes.  Those top notes are relatively balanced and don't call too much attention to themselves until the tail end of the exhale where they linger and turn a bit perfumey and bitter.  Slightly candy raspberry base flavor, with a pretty spot-on sweetness.  Manages to avoid going full-on syrupy but definitely skirts the line there.  Pretty restrained tartness here as well.  Moderately dense overall, not quite as warm as INW Raspberry, but definitely warmer than you'd expect from a straight fruit.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  A bit floral.  It's pretty well done up until the end where it falls apart.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light to Moderate. Pretty classic harshness on the exhale type, both from the fruit and the florals here.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I'll just get this out of the way right off the bat, I love this stuff with INW Rhubarb. If you're looking for a good rhubarb pairing, this stuff right here is magic.\n\nIt's a better raspberry for pairing with other fruits.  At lower percentages, good to add some vibrancy and realism to more syrupy berries. Mixes relatively well with brighter citrus.\n\nIt's a bit tricky with bakeries and creams. It's hard to get a nice, bright raspberry note without letting in too many of those florals.  I'd go for a heavier cream base like Ice Cream or Custard, as those floral notes will overwhelm lighter and more delicate creams.\n\n**Notes:**  So right up front, I like this heavier than the consensus opinion, so as always YMMV. S&V concentration testing, at .25% this is pretty light. Really just a hint of raspberry.  At .5%, It still seems a bit weak to me. Good raspberry accent, but not really punchy enough for a main note.  1% is actually pretty good, I'm getting a slightly syrupy raspberry with a little bit of tartness and light florals. 1.5% is where to florals really start to show up, and just kind of build from there. This gets a bit bitter and perfumey for me at 2.5% and I don't think the actual raspberry gets a whole lot better. I'd mix with this as a supporting note at .75-1% and a primary note at 1.5-2% depending on your thoughts on the florals here.\n\nI tried to keep my rampant fanboy-ism in check on this flavor but I really do go through a ton of this stuff.  I can't taste strawberry worth a damn, so this stuff is my go to for a brighter berry flavor.  Just personally, it's my favorite raspberry by miles. The florals are fairly balanced, it doesn't have that kind of slobbery wetness I get from INW Raspberry, or the ketchupy vibe that I get from TFA Sweet Raspberry.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[HIC notes:](http://mamajsflavorshop.com/headinclouds-my-notes-on-flavor-descriptions/)\n\n\"This is a little stronger than most FA flavors, and it tends to make itself noticed in recipes, so go light with it. Even 0.5% can stand out in a recipe with mild flavors, and 2% will overwhelm most recipes. This is a natural berry flavor with mostly sweet and a little fresh-tart flavor. It is not candy-sweet, but it’s easily made into candy flavors when used with sweeter flavors. A really excellent pairing for fresh berry flavor is FA Blackcurrant. Equal amounts of the two make the beginning of popular European candies.\"\n\n[Some talk on using this to make a full raspberry flavor.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/5gr79y/fa_raspberry_to_raspberry_sweet/)\n\n[VU seems to agree that I may be over-flavoring with this](http://vapingunderground.com/threads/fa-raspberry-issues.225357/)\n\n[Mostly positive reviews on BCF, although there is one that says this tastes fermented.](http://www.bullcityflavors.com/raspberry-fa/)  [Again, mostly positive reviews on ECX but the negative reviews are super-negative.](http://www.ecigexpress.com/diy-e-liquid/browse-flavorings/fruit-flavors/raspberry-by-flavourart.html?p=2)\n\nI'm starting to think this concentrate is pretty polarizing.\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

    "markdown": "**Setup:** Recoil w/ flavor barrel, Dual 15 wrap 26g 3mm Nifethal 70 coils @.16 ohms.  60w power, 420F temp limit. Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FA Reggae Night, 1 and 2.5%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 9 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  A very fresh green flavor, a tiny bit on the dry side.  The whole \"reggae night\" thing is too cute by half, but this doesn't really taste anything like Marijuana, or at least anything like actually smoking it.  I get a pretty distinct juniper flavor right up front.  The actual juniper note tastes a lot like the juniper in FA Gin. There are some cucumber skin and fresh cut grass top notes to this.  The end result is very fresh tasting, differing from some of the heavier, warmer vegetal notes that end up tasting a bit swampy.  There is a bit of a warmer, camphourous pine note underneath it all, but it feels pretty well balanced and doesn't take away that much from the freshness of the flavor overall.  That pine note is the only part that really evokes the source material, it's just a hint of that piney, hops-esque skunky aroma.  I'd roll solo with this and a dash of cooling at 3%, or mix with bright, fresh citrus, mints, or cocktail flavors at 2%.\n\nInhale is mostly juniper. Medium dense, and just a bit dry.  Slight harshness and maybe just a hair sweeter than it needs to be. Does better at relatively lower temperatures where the sweetness isn't as pronounced. At higher temperatures manages to avoid that wilted, warm salad flavor that other herbaceous flavors can take on.   Exhale opens with that same clear juniper. Green, and fresh. Dry, leafy texture to it. Cucumber peel shows up in the top notes after. Splitting hairs, but seems a bit thicker and slightly bitter like a normal cucumber, and not the individually wrapped english variety that you eat with the skin on.  Has a fresh cut grass note to it as well. Almost like smelling a freshly cut crudite platter. Resinous pine undertone to this on the back half, a little warmer and sweeter. Well balanced flavor that seems to accent rather than dominate that fresher, herbal note. Pine lingers a bit on the finish.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Doesn't really match just a marijuana flavor. Also missing the heavy body odor of hanging out with the kind of stoners that would participate in said reggae night.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light.  It's a bit dry and leafy overall.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Shoutout to the randos wandering in occasionally asking about non-sweet flavors.  This isn't necessarily entirely bereft of sweetness, but it's a well balanced, green herbal and vegetal flavor.  So if that sounds like you're thing, go solo with this around 3% probably with just a hint of koolada, polar blast, or ws-23 to keep this fresh tasting and steer clear of a cooked vegetable flavor.\n\nPairing with this, that juniper note is really prominent.  This would make a good booster for a gin flavor and most of those other cucumber and grass notes aren't actually out of profile for a gin.  If you added this to TPA Champagne or FW Pink Champagne, it would actually make a good gin without using a gin concentrate.\n\nIn mixes, I think the best bet in using this would be a lot like you'd use a realistic cucumber flavor.  I'm thinking mints, basil, anise, and citrus.  I can even see stretching with this and pairing with fresher, brighter melons like honeydew.  You could even go crazy and aim for bright red fruits, but I've found that the pine part of this starts to stick out when mixed with anything too syrupy.\n\n**Notes:**  Seems pretty linear. At .5%, it's light but the pine undertone seems a bit more prominent at higher concentration.  At 1%, The juniper is starting to hit.  Tastes like light juniper and a noticeable pine. At 1.5% the more complex, slightly bitter cucumber peel is starting to move forward. 2% is getting a bit grassy, but grassy in a good way. More freshly cut grass than the harsher acetone note from green apples. At 2.5% The pine is sitting pretty comfortably at the back of the flavor. At 3%, this is seems pretty well balanced. I get a clear juniper up front, fresh green top notes, and just enough warmer, thicker pine to keep it from tasting thin or soapy. At 4% this seems a bit much.  There's a bitterness to the top notes and it may be too green.  I'd use this at 3% for a primary flavor with cooling and between 1.5 and 2% as an accent.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[3 stars all around at ECX.  User \"Logan\" writes: \"It has a freshly cut fescue grass taste/odor, so by itself is not very... Accurate. However I could see this part of some type of blend. For some strange reason, mine turned white and cloudy some time after having it, and I don't consider it safe for use any more. Not sure if it is the liquid itself or if it dissolved some of the plastic, though that doesn't seem likely.\"  I haven't heard of this flavor turning opaque yet, but it does apparently tend to turn your mixes slightly blue.  Maybe stick to glass on this one.](http://www.ecigexpress.com/diy-e-liquid/diy-e-liquid-flavors/flavourart-usa/flavourart-floral-flavors/reggae-night-by-flavourart-11317.html)\n\n[Reddit post about looking for something that actually hits the profile.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FA Rose @ 1%. 60/40 VG/PG, steeped 42 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Chalky rose with a fairly strong green note in there.  Like a vegetal rose candy flavor, if that was a thing at all.  Personally, this gets weird for me with any kind of extended use. Like it's okay for the first couple drags and then it turns my stomach a bit.\n\nInhale dominated by a bitter, sharp floral rose.  Green, slightly citric sour kind of base sweetness.  Exhale has perfume rose right up front. Very floral to the point of being sharp.  Not really soapy, but like a potpourri kind of flavor. Green notes come back through underneath as the floral note gets dry and chalky.  Still that almost citrus fresh green leaf kind of sweetness. Lingering sourness and powdery rose. \n\n**Off-flavors:**  That green flavor is rough, and as I vape it gets more and more prominent.  The powdery mouthfeel is pretty distracting too.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Moderate, gets harsh and a bit acidic as you really dig into it.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  So people do use this stuff.\n[This is a floral forward vape by ATF user \"Evan,\" pairing this with honeysuckle, lavender, pear, and pomegranate.](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/24091#winding_rose_by_evan) Personally, I'm not touching this stuff at 4%, even with the deadening from the sweetener.  [ELR user \"DarthVapor\" uses this as an accent flavor to strawberries in their \"Nana's Rose Cookies\" which seems smart.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/recipe/267436/Nana%27s%20Rose%20Cookies)  Probably the most palatable use of this kind of flavor is adding some complexity to a brighter fruit flavor.\n\nHocusKrokus suggests pairing this with \"Lychee, Raspberries, Pear, Hibiscus, Cherry, Grape, and Champagne flavors.\"  Just do that.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nS&V concentration testing I'm probably the worst person to ask here, but just for the laffs... .25% I get mostly green flavor. Not a lot of really distinct rose. .5% is a bit better. Some of the florals are showing up and complementing instead of fighting against the green note. Like eating fresh roses, basically. At 1% this is getting a lot denser and that rose is getting powdery. 1.5% is making me nauseous, so that's fun.  More powdery rose flavor, green note is getting astringent. 2% is just chalky rose up top and that green note is sharp.  Just use HocusKrokus's suggestions here. \"1.5% in delicate mixes, 2.5% if paired with somewhat more potent flavors. 3% standalone max.\"\n\nThis is 100% not my thing.  It's a bummer, because I used to dig rose shisha. I think I want a slightly fuller, tarter, rosehip kind of flavor and all I've gotten from this is a floral, powdery, green mess.  It's sort of pleasant for a while and then it just gets sickly. That's my own personal damage, i guess.  I hit satiation on this kind of flavor really quick and after that I'm over it. I've been told that attar of rose by Decadent Vapours was good, but that appears to not be a thing anymore... at least according to my cursory googling.  I like /u/hocuskrokus/ 's notes on TPA Rose Candy... so I may give that a shot but otherwise I'm done with rose.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[The man, the myth, the legend... u/HocusKrokus wants to tell you about florals.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/4t7z6g/some_notes_on_florals/)  If you haven't noticed, I pretty much double-checked his review and turned into the patented ConcreteRiver wall of text.\n\n\"FA Rose: It smells like bright red roses. The taste is pretty sweet and lightly chalky/powdered sugary. Similar to Rose candies than Rose water.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FA Royal Orange @ .5% and 1.5%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 8 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Navel orange. Some warmer, waxy citrus base and a slightly dry orange juice top note. Tastes a lot like [FLV Orange Citrus](https://redd.it/5hzkrr) and [CAP Juicy Orange](https://redd.it/5do6oo) combined.  Brighter than the Orange Citrus though, and without the harshness I get from the Juicy Orange. Nothing too sharp or harsh here, pretty mellow and full. Just a bit weaker than you'd expect from a Flavourart citrus,  I'd use between 1% - 3%.\n\nInhale has a bit of sharper orange zest, with a slightly powdery tangerine body. Inhale is warmer as opposed to really crisp and tart, with a pretty full mouthfeel and solid but not cloying sweetness.  Exhale has a warm and waxy base,  pretty accurate navel orange sweetness. Some bright orange juice in the top notes.  Slightly tart and a bit dry, but not harsh or sharp.  Overall effect is kind of like a orange juice from concentrate without quite as much recommended water added in.  Clean finish overall, with some lighter orange zest notes.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Nothing that really seems out of place.  Maybe a bit warm and fuller than a straight citrus flavor, but it's fairly balanced and the entire thing works pretty well.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Fairly light, which is cool for a citrus.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  While this has some brightness along with that fuller body, I'm not sure it's a great choice for a primary note in a straight fruit mix.  I think you can get some body and zest out of this when mixed with other fruits, but I'd want something else to be the star of the show. For a citrus mix, I think adding a brighter, more acidic grapefruit or lime on top of this to draw focus in the recipe would work best.  You could throw just about any kind of fruit and use this for some warmth, body, and lighter smooth zest notes and let something else take the spotlight.\n\nGood choice for pairing with creams and custards, or bakeries. The lack of strong, bright acidity is going to let this blend well without making the entire too bright or harsh.\n\nBody here would also work for orange or citrus based candies. Just enough realism to ground the profile, but not enough to really dominate.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nConcentration testing, this is just a bit lighter than I'd expect. .25% has some light zest notes, and a bit of warmer body.  .5% has a bit of brightness and tartness up top in addition to that light zest. Body feels about the same. Flavor overall feels a bit light.  1% has a brighter top note.  Still light, but less so. Some bright acidity starting to peek out, with the same fuller body.  1.5% has a heavier, warmer body to it, but you're still getting some fresher, brighter notes.  2% has a heavier body still, tastes a lot like slightly less than fresh orange juice, where the top notes have been driven off the juice a bit. 3% is getting a bit powdery in the top notes, along with that heavier body.  4% is getting a bit harsh and heavy.  I'd recommend using this at 1% for a citrus zest accent, and around 2%-3% for a base flavor, depending on how well that powdery note works with the rest of your mix.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nStill pretty new, so not a lot out there.\n\n[Here's the ELR Page.

Very much of that smell comes through, though I feel the caramel notes are taking a backseat to the nutty tobacco. It does retain the sweetness I’d look for in an RY4, if that’s the direction you’d want to take Soho, assuming the caramel notes don’t become more prominent with a steep, they’ll need help to really flesh out the profile.\n\n**After a week:**      \nThis is still really nice. The sweet and nutty notes have gotten stronger, and it’s sort of makes me think hazelnuts. The tobacco is very well blended into the flavor. I wouldn't say it is particularly dark, dry, or leafy. It's very much a supporting note and the sweetness sort of buries any particularly distinct notes in the tobacco. I don’t think this is quite an RY4, I get no vanilla, but it’s very much in the same vein. I don’t know that the caramel notes are really any more forward than they were before, but the flavor is very much in balance. I could honestly vape this all day with little to no modification and be reasonably happy with the results.\n\n**Off notes:**    \nNothing off at 3%. I wouldn’t be shocked if this started to get a bit weird if you pushed it too high.\n\n**Throat hit:**   \nJust shy of nothing, it’s very smooth.\n\n**Suggested pairings:**      \nRicher tobaccos, caramels, nuts, clove, maybe even a cream if you’re feeling adventurous. It feels like this is very agreeable, sort of a “tobacco with training wheels” type flavor.\n\n[DIY_Ejuice’s Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)",

This looks like a really clean flavor. Flavourart is renowned for producing clean, healthy and accurate flavors. This is certainly no exception.\n\nHmm, it smells like Wrigley's Spearmint gum! It also kind of reminds me a little of Darlie's Toothpaste (go figure, spearmint is commonly used in these products after all). \n\n**Taste:**\n\nAs expected, it tastes like Wrigley's gum. Again, like FA Peppermint, the mint is very weak, almost nothing like chewing Wrigley's or brushing your teeth. It needs some help in that department with TFA Menthol or another mint to bolster the chilling effect.\n\nThere's a pleasant sweetness on tongue but it's never cloying. The mint serves as more of a backnote and it's pretty much non-intrusive.\n\n**Standalone/Mixer:**\n\nIf you're something who likes vaping simple flavorings without much of complexity, this could be your jam. It's a simple, cooling and refreshing vape. There's really not much else to say about it. However, I believe this would shine exceptionally well with a crisp fruit like pear.

So... I probably just imagined any kind of tobacco in that because of a typo.  That description fits a lot better here. Still newish to tobaccos but this has a drier, slightly acrid tobacco note with just a bit of ash to it. There's a deep fruity sweetness here.  It's either some kind of a plum or maybe just an attempt at getting some of the fruity notes off a darker tobacco. It tastes a lot like that raisiny smell from a fresh pack of cigarettes but somehow given more body and turned into an actual fruit flavor. The finish on this is weird, there isn't really a heavy spice note, although I can pick out something like clove.  There is almost a celery-ish astringency right at the end with some bitterness. Actually tastes a lot like someone mixed in some parsley with that tobacco blend.  I'm a bit at a loss for what to do with this, It's already got a strong tobacco note, the fruit is pretty well balanced, and those greener notes make me want it nowhere near nuttier or bakery flavors.  So solo at 3%?\n\nInhale is surprisingly sweet. Mostly a heavy, cooked plum flavor. Some sharper, dry tobacco in the top notes with maybe a hit of clove.  Inhale is actually fairly dense and saturated. Closer to a dry mouthfeel, but there is a some syrupy character to that fruit. Exhale opens with a dry tobacco. Feels like it's in the same family as something like FA Arabian Tobacco or less intense. Closer to what I've got out of turkish concentrates. Fruit shows up after that initial tobacco burst. Still too syrupy and sweet to really read as a plum or raisin note. Feels a bit more fresh and less dehydrated than that. Tail end of the exhale gets odd. There's a clove spice, but there are these weird savory dry herbal notes. There's also some green astringency and bitterness, almost parsley-esque.  Relatively clean finish. Overall sweeter and bolder than a lot of flavourart flavors.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Flavourart talks about this being spicy, but it doesn't really fit my definition of spicy.  It's like a dry herbal flavor instead.  Weird, slightly bitter astringency on the backend.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Moderate. You'll know it's a tobacco.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I don't have a lot of ideas. Probably more of a solo flavor than anything else. What is here is pretty well in balance.\n\nIf you did want to mix something with this, you're pretty much stuck using this a primary note. I don't feel like the tobacco really needs any accenting, and that herbal note gives me some pause when thinking about nutty or bakery flavors. This could maybe stand just a bit more dark fruit, I'm thinking like FA Apricot or maybe a peach if you want to go sweeter.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, at 1% this actually feels a bit warmer.  There's not a lot of tobacco but that weird herbal note is really clear and there is a solid dark fruit sweetness.  At 2% the tobacco is starting to fill in quite a bit. The herbals seem a little less pronounced next to that heavier tobacco. Fruit is maybe just a touch heavier but it's starting to feel syrupy. At 3% the tobacco is richer while the light ash here is sort balancing the syrupy fruit.  The herbal weirdness seems more effectively sequestered to the finish.  4% is intense all around. The tobacco is getting kind of acrid and that herbal note is making it all taste a little plasticy. I'd mix with this at 3%.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[HIC's note on this are really pretty great.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FA Summer Clouds, 1 and 2.5%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 7 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Flavourart writes: \"With a hint of Peach leading the line-up of delicate flavours, Summer Clouds delivers a delightfully light sensation to your taste buds, likened to the pure and gentle freshness of an English Rose in full bloom.\"  So okay. I get mostly peach on the beginning on the vape, and florals coming in shortly thereafter. Peach note feels like a pretty generic yellow peach bordering on peach rings, especially as the concentration increases. It also feels like there is something else going on with the fruit. Definite zest heavy citrus to this, right on the tail end. It's hard to nail down, but it definitely doesn't feel like a lime or orange.  If I had to guess it's lemon, although I wouldn't argue with Cheeba's assessment in the second opinions that it's a grapefruit. Also feels like there is a bit of extra red berry sweetness on that peach.  Could be a strawberry or a raspberry, but it's pretty light and it may just be a heavier candy peach note. The description draws a comparison to an English rose, but I'm not sold that the floral here is rose... or at least not the straight up FA Rose flavor. I'm not getting much in way of the green, vegetal flavor I pick up with rose. It feels a bit more like the drier, chalky lavender they use. Floral note is prominent, but fairly well balanced and works well with the fruit that they are using.  It's a well built, well balanced flavor, but it's definitely on the floral side.  Seems like a pretty solid single flavor if you're into the profile, but I can see accentuating the florals or fruit and using this as a base flavor for something less delicate. This feel like it gets too floral quickly, I'd mix with this at about 2%.\n\nInhale is mostly peach.  Kind of dry and sticky, with a medium sweetness. There is some floral sharpness to it, especially as the concentration goes up. I don't get much actual floral taste on the inhale, but you feel the florals in there. Moderately dense, but the dryness along with the stickier texture of that peach is a bit odd. Exhale opens with yellow peach, with maybe some additional red berry sweetness. Peach note borders on a heavy candy peach, and the sticky, dry mouthfeel just reinforces that.  Florals kind of roar in after that. I get chalky floral top notes, more like a floral pastille than a greener, full flower.  It doesn't taste like a rose, or at least it doesn't taste like FA Rose.  It may end up being closer to TPA Rose Candy. It's a difficult to pick out a specific floral flavor, but it feels a lot like the drier, chalkier FA Lavender or a less intense version of FA Violet.  Citrus picks up on the end of the vape.  It's a slightly astringent, bitter, lemon zest kind of note. It feels just a bit tacked on and like a cleaning product scent. Mouthfeel is sticky from that peach, then dry from the florals and citrus. Not a really heavy, vibrant flavor but more restrained (I guess?)  Lingering slightly bitter perfume and a bit of astringency from that citrus.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Welp, it's called FA Dryer Sheets for a reason.  The drier, chalky floral and the citrus zest can come across as reminiscent of a cleaning product after that initial burst of peach.  Does it taste like an actual summer cloud? Seems to hit the profile they lay out.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Some harshness from the fruit here.  Not really overwhelming throat hit, but it can get a bit hard to vape and dry with that chalky floral note.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  For the floral fans only. Flavourart tries to trick you with the peach up front, but the florals here absolutely define this concentrate.\n\nThis could definitely work as a solo flavor at around 2% if that's what you're looking for.  Everything here works, and it seems pretty well balanced, but it's a floral concentrate so just go in with your eyes open.\n\nOutside of using this solo, It's a bit too peachy to just use the floral note... and it's way too floral to just use for the fruit.  If you are in the small part of the venn diagram where your mix needs both peach and a pronounced floral note, then game on.  I'd probably end up running with the florals here and actually accent them a bit with some TPA Cherry Blossom or FA Lavender.  Also seems like a good fit for some Rose, if that's your thing.  I think you could also punch up the fruit here with some more citrus, strawberry, or watermelon.  If you are interested in something like a floral cream, this seems like a pretty safe bet as well.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, this is mostly about the floral note. At .25% and .5% I'm getting mostly light peach. There's a slight floral sharpness in there, but the florals seem pretty well integrated with whatever is going on underneath. At 1% the florals are coming in clear, but they still seem like an accent. Peach note is filling out a bit and pushing forwards toward peach rings. Light lemon zest note, almost seems to be adding a bit of sour to that candy peach note.  1.5% is a bit more candied on the peach. There is still something a bit more realistic here, but you're getting some more of that gummy texture.  Florals are definitely kicking up a bit but still taste a little thin. 2% has candy peach.  That citrus note is a bit more prominent, still mostly in the top notes and zest heavy. Florals have thickened up a bit. Pushing perfumey but thicker and less texturally out of place. 3% is feeling too floral, like eating peach rings while smelling perfume.  I'd stay around 2% with this unless you're really after a heavy floral punch.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[FWIW, this may be the genesis of the FA Dryer Sheets thing about this flavor.  You probably shouldn't use this at 5%.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/2kq8nj/oh_god_dont_do_what_i_just_did/)\n\n[A lot of copies of user \"boogenshizzle\"'s notes on the ELR: \"Peach is very bold and can be taken to peach rings (gummy) or natural peach with the addition of something fleshy.The citrus note is really barely noticeable and is more on the exhale. Slightly floral - Rose - like a petal of a rose. not so much like the candy, though I've mixed it with both roses.\"  User \"HollywoodVApes\" adds: \"So ok after trying this flavor solo it reminds me of peaches with a flowery note but I just couldnt pick out what I dont like and I swear I just figured it out! It has almost a baby powder taste to it. Very odd, I know, but thats me anyways and this flavor will definitely tone down any flavor you put it with even in small percentages. I would use it to down down really sharp peaches or maybe a tea. Maybe I will try in some others like chocolate that are heavy but all in all this is a very unique taste ;-)......I would say using this flavoring will cover others like a \"Summer Cloud\" HAHA.\"  HAHA, indeed \"HolllywoodVApes.\"](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/28799)\n\n[Largely solid reviews on BCF.  The illustrious CheebaSteeba contributes: \"So this is an interesting flavoring. The first thing that comes to mind to describe this one is \"Mist.\" I wouldn't say it's \"wet,\" but it certainly isn't dry. It has a slight floral note to it though it's difficult for me to pick out; if I had to guess I might say lavender. It does something pretty wonderful a tea mix I put it in playing off of the floral and earth notes. I get maybe a little bit of grapefruit too from it, but it's hard to say since I only SFT @ 1% and it's a fairly mild flavor.\"](http://www.bullcityflavors.com/summer-clouds-fa/)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**\n\n[Bonus, incredibly rambling, video first test of Morning Sun, Cocoon, and Summer Clouds.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUYazRP62tA)\n\nShoutout to /u/ID10-T for suggesting this for review.",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FA Vanilla Bourbon @ 2%, 60% VG, 40% VG, Steeped 30 days\n\n**Flavor Description:** Warm vanilla, rather than a candy or extract vanilla.  Moderate sweetness, light to moderate density.  Warming effect is similar to a really light bakery cinnamon or even TFA Kentucky Bourbon.  Nothing that tastes remotely like those flavors, but the overall effect is similar.\n\nInhale is warm, moderately sweet and moderately dense vanilla.  Really middle-of-the-road in the best way. Some floral notes here with a richer cream-soda type base. Light exhale with a light natural tasting sweetness.  Vanilla note here is a little thin, floral without being perfumey. Overall warmth stays with you throughout the exhale and lingers a bit. \n\n**Off-flavors:**  Tiny bit of raw alcohol bite in the middle of the exhale, mostly noticeable with sustained use.  I only started to notice it after about 5ml vaped solo.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Warming effect is pronounced, maybe a tiny bit of throat hit but very minimal.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I'd use this primarily for lighter creams, milkshake bases without a malty base, and less aggressive ice creams.  FLV Cream and FA Cream Fresh spring to mind, although it may highlight that tiny spice note in FLV Cream. Not a lot of extra creaminess here, so your cream base's thickness is going to be dependent on the cream mix you're using.\n\nWarming effect would be great for anything with cinnamon, especially horchatas. Probably a bit thin but workable for bakeries as well, especially the icing on a cinnamon roll.\n\nA good fit for thinning out heavier chocolates while adding a little more nuance and texture.\n\nGood vanilla for tobacco mixes. Relative thinness and light warmness shouldn't make your tobaccos too creamy while giving a solid vanilla note.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nConcentrate is fairly dark but seems to be okay on coils so\nS&V concentration testing, light and floral, almost bitter at %.5 and 1%.  This is really nice starting at 1.5%. Vanilla fills in a bit and the sweetness definitely shows up as does that warming effect. Largely similar but more saturated at 2%. 2.5% and above gets a pretty heavy extract type of vibe and seems to kill a lot of the nuance and charm. I'd mix with this at 1.5% to 2% for a full vanilla note with that warming quality. I don't think this is a good fit for a one-shot or primary note in a mix.\n\n[**INW Vanilla Bourbon Flavor Review**](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/5lqd8s/inw_vanilla_bourbon/)\n\n[**TFA Vanilla Bourbon Flavor Review**](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/5lqdpb/tfa_vanilla_bourbon/)\n\nReally simple take on the available Vanilla Bourbon concentrates: INW reads marshmallow, TFA reads malty extract, and FA reads as a warm vanilla additive.  I'd use INW for strong, bright marshmallowy vanilla in a fruit mix or over the top rich mixes, TFA for heavy custards and bakeries without spice, and FA for lighter creams and bakeries with a bit of spice as well as nutty or tobacco mixes.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[So there is another review for this concentrate by /u/Jigsaw314.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/4mgy4i/vanilla_bourbon_fa/)  Comments are closed on the post, otherwise I would have just left this as a comment.

Hints of darker vanilla bean in there. Includes a bit of the sourness you'd get from a cheaper vanilla extract. Sweet, but not crazy sweet.  I still wouldn't call this super floral, but it has less of a bright frosting note to it. This is about halfway between FA Vanilla Tahity and FA Vanilla Bourbon.  Seems like the most versatile of the FA vanillas, although the least pleasant solo.\n\nInhale is has some light body, with a sharper building vanilla. Light sweetness and a slightly floral top note.

Denser bakeries, heavier creams / ice creams and custards, all that noise.\n\nDoesn't seem to like to blend all that well with brighter, tarter flavors. Sort of exacerbates the thinness and slight souness here. I'd probably stay away from fruit forward mixes with this one.\n\n**Notes:**  S&V concentration testing, this is fairly potent. Testing it solo was a bit of a drag, so I've thrown in it in with 1% Zeppola. %'s are going to be a bit squisher than usual, but this really isn't a solo vanilla.  At .25%, this is pretty sneaky. I'm getting just a hint of vanilla in the top notes. At .5%, I'm still just getting this in the top notes. Noticeable vanilla bean accent, but it isn't messing with underlying zeppola texture. At 1% I'm starting to a hint of the exhale sourness. Actually tasting just a smidge unbalanced.  At 1.5%, I'm getting too much of that extract texture, and at 2% I'm really not enjoying this. This seems pretty strong, so I'd start low.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FA Vanilla Tahity @ %2, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 12 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Vanilla almond milk mixed with lucky charms marshmallows. Very \"commercial\" vanilla profile with a nutty undertone, fluffy body, and aggressive sweetness.  After a steep, I don't get too much in the way of floral vanilla here.\n\nInhale is definitely sweet, with a pretty heavy fluffy body.  Some pretty mellow drier vanilla.  Not quite chalky but not too far off either. Exhale has bright vanilla up front.  Non-floral and very sweet. Doesn't taste rich so as much as really dense.  Not too much in the way of top notes, maybe just a hint of a higher, more natural vanilla. Back half of the exhale has almond coming through fairly strong. With the almond and the sweetness, almost crosses into marzipan.  Still very fluffy and a little sweet. Tail end of the exhale has a cereal-marshmallow kind of malt to it. Not too overbearing, but hard to \"untaste\" when you pick it out.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Almonds and malty mini marshmallows. Not unpleasant but not really covered by \"Vanilla.\"  Also really sweet.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light, the fluffyness here can get a bit dry.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Right off the bat, this may end up being my choice for a single flavor vanilla. All due respect to the Holy V (and it's myriad devotees), but I like how the nuttyness gives some extra body here and the malt doesn't quite push into some of the sour dairy I get from holy vanilla.\n\nBeyond that, this is fairly close to INW Vanilla Shisha or INW Vanilla Bourbon, substituting some of the creaminess there for a more overt nuttiness. I'd say it could be used in pretty much the same way.  Useful for pairing with brighter fruits, and the lack of a strong floral component opens it up to mixing with stone fruit especially.\n\nThe sweetness here is pretty intense and marshmallow-y, so might not be the ideal tool for a bakery where you want to keep a savory edge and denser texture.\n\nI'd go for this in sweeter tobacco mixes, with the nuttyness complementing some of the dryer tobaccos well.\n\nInteresting choice for a cream or custard. I think that almond will show up... which isn't a bad thing, but not as creamy as some of your other options.\n\nAnd hey, it's awesome in coffee.\n\n**Notes:**  S&V concentration testing, noticeable but light down at .25%. A thinner, floral kind of vanilla. .5% has more body but still tastes a bit thin and muted. Perfectly workable this low as a vanilla accent. 1% really starts to get some body and fluffyness. That almond shows up clear at 1.5% and by 2% it's getting to be fairly prominent. Kind of like a marzipan marshmallow. At 3%, this is getting really sweet and the fluffyness is getting pretty dry. 4% seems like the florals are picking up and getting fairly sharp.  I'd recommend starting with this at .5% as an accent for fruits, 1% for some added vanilla body to a cream or bakery, or 2% if you really want to use the texture here and don't mind the almond/marzipan note.  Worth noting in other reviews that the actual vanilla part of this has a tendency to lay back in mixes and can be easily overwhelmed. I think you'll still get the sweeteness and texture pretty loud and clear, but watch for that or add a spicier, floral vanilla like FA Vanilla Bourbon back in to pick some of that vanilla back up.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[HIC wrote some Flavour Art notes, were you aware?](http://mamajsflavorshop.com/headinclouds-my-notes-on-flavor-descriptions/)\n\n\"Vanilla Tahiti is the flavor of Tahitian vanilla extract. It's a bright vanilla flavor with light fruitiness, just like real Tahitian vanilla extract. Some people may detect a note of almond/cherry. This is the sweetest of FA's vanillas. It's usually the best one to choose with fresh fruit flavors, especially mild fruits. Bold or 'dark' flavors can overwhelm it, so it's best used either with light fruit flavors or in recipes that include vanilla as a main ingredient. It's just as strongly-flavored as the others when vaped standalone, but it's more easily lost if used as an accent.\"\n\n[Quite a few positive reviews on ECX.](http://www.ecigexpress.com/diy-e-liquid/browse-flavorings/herb-spice-flavors/vanilla-tahiti-by-flavourart.html)  User \"Anthony\" has my favorite review, maybe of all time:\n\n\"This has a floral note that's a bit strong. It's the almondy-flowery-tropical thing. I prefer a straight vanilla. Now, in all fairness, it mellows out after a day or two. The first whiff is Cyanide at a Luau with plastic flowers. Then the floral evaporates or reacts or whatever these things do, and you're left with more almond-vanilla. I'm sure I'll figure out where to blend it in, none of FA's flavors are \"like,doh\".\"\n\nI can see where this \"Anthony\" is coming from when this is unsteeped, but I don't get much in the way of the florals after a steep. Still comic gold though.\n\n[Here's a FOTW on vanilla.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/4gdzxh/flavor_of_the_week_vanilla/)  Interesting part with regards to FA Vanilla Tahity is /u/BooksofMagic comment that \"Vanilla Tahity is fantastic when added to fruit mixes.  You can't really taste it, but it does add a certain something that you notice when it's missing.\"  /u/tranceinate comes back with \"It's the the almond note that makes fruits pop.\"\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FA VaPimms @ 1 and 2.5%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 18 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Another Flavourart UK blend. This one is apparently modelled on a Pimm's cup or a blend of Pimm's liqueur, gin, and fruit. What I get out of this is primarily juniper, citrus peel, and clove. It's been a long time since I've actually had Pimm's, but it seems like it's in the ballpark. I'd say it's heavy on the clove, but I get flavor blind to clove relatively quickly and it fades to something more like a banana flavor.  Dry, spicy, citrus zest flavor. I'm guessing it's bergamot, but it could just be a lemon zest. There's a green flavor to this, some of it's probably the juniper from the gin, but I feel like there may be a bit of cucumber in here as well. Some fruitiness, especially at slightly higher percentages but that spice note seems to take over.  Dry for something supposedly modelled on a beverage.  The traditional mixers with Pimm's are apparently lemonade and ginger ale, and I could see those working really well to fill this out and some beverage-esque qualities. I also think this would benefit from a hit of mint or some other kind of cooling.  I'd use this around 3% for a primary note and build around it.\n\nInhale is spice forward. Clove note, with some dryer citrus zest. Has that clove-y slightly peppery note I get from FA Bergamot. Some sweetness underneath, but that spice is taking center stage. Inhale is moderately dense. Pretty intense but not harsh. Exhale starts off with a soft fruity base. Seems pretty indistinct, but it has an apple or pear softness.  Some tarter citrus in there. There is a lot going on in the top notes here. Clove spice, citrus zest, Woody Juniper all sort of blending into a distinct herbal or bitters taste. I get some green flavor on the tail end of the exhale, could easily be cucumber or just some herbal depth from the gin. Dryer mouthfeel, that clove seems to be taking it away from a beverage vape. Some citrus waxiness right on the tail end. Relatively clean finish for everything going on here.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  It's been a while, so I'm not 100% sure what belongs and doesn't belong. I will say the clove note seems way high here.  Texture is also too dry for a solo beverage vape.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light. Aggressive flavors, but not really harsh.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Needs some help coming across as an actual beverage.  Go all Wimbeldon and throw in some lemonade. Ginger Ale would be nice. I could see Iced Tea. I think adding this to a cola is going to drag it closer to a more interesting, naturalish cola rather than straight Coke. It may even get you in the neighborhood of Moxie.  You could also up the herbals with a bit of FLV Lovage, Basil or even some FA Zen Garden.  Some cooling would also be nice.\n\nOutside of shooting for a pimms cup type of beverage, this could be used as a slightly different take on bitters in your cocktail vapes. Should pair well with even more gin or whiskey.  Reminds me of a toned down version of INW Shisha Punch.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, at 1% this seems awfully clove heavy. More spice than anything else down this low.  1.5% has a bit more depth to it, but the clove (or whatever the hell I'm misidentifying this spice note as) is still up front. 2% gives you a rounder flavor. The juniper from the gin and some of that greener flavor is starting to show through a bit. Citrus zest is a bit more identifiable. At 2.5% the fruit is becoming a factor.  Really hard to distinguish what exactly I should be tasting, but there's a baseline fruitiness which is helping to soften things up. 3% has about as much bright fruit as I get out of this. Juniper seems to be letting a bit more cucumber through. 4% is tasting pretty bitter.  I'm happy with this around 2.5-3%.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Quick review from user \"jcol\" on Planet of the Vapes forum: \"Only mixed this at 10% and the flavour really comes out. The description says its similar in taste to Gin & Tonic, now i have never drank a G&T so i wouldnt know, but i get a taste quite similar to Southern Comfort. Its got a fruity taste on the inhale and a nice spicey exhale.\"](https://www.planetofthevapes.co.uk/forums/product-reviews/flavour-concentrate-reviews/beverages/threads/flavour-arts-vapimms-range.39735/)\n\n[Product page from FlavourArt UK.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FA VimTonic, 1 and 2.5%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 22 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  My last Flavourart UK blend, this time apparently based on [VimTo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vimto) an English patent medicine turned fruit cordial.  The company describes the flavor as \"a mix of three fruit juices - grape, blackcurrant and raspberry - along with a mysterious blend of 23 fruit essences, herbs and spices.\"  This doesn't taste as complex as that sounds. Primarily a dark and syrupy fruit mix, with the blackcurrant providing most of the definable taste. They're some added sweetness and over just straight FA Blackcurrant, maybe a relatively smaller percentage of FA raspberry but could be a cherry and some additional jammy mouthfeel that conceivably be coming from FA White Grape. I'm not getting a ton in terms of \"herbs and spices\" but it does seem to have a sort of cola-ish spiciness especially on the tail end of the exhale. Dry mouthfeel for something based on a liquid, and a moderate amount of harshness in there. This would be an interesting candy base, or I could see taking it in a cocktail or beverage direction with some additional, more watery volume. I like this around 3% as a primary note.\n\nInhale is sweet and dark berries. Inhale has that pretty distinctive sticky swedish fish sweetness from FA Blackcurrant. Some more neutral fruit sweetness underneath that, but inhale is pretty dominated by the blackcurrant. Exhale opens up with that same blackcurrant note.  Some really light spice in the top notes, but I'll be damned if I can nail it down past all that jammy blackcurrant.  Kind of gets dr. pepper-ish, but that could just be the 23 herbs and spices marketing tagline kicking around in my head. Blackcurrant thins out a bit on the back of the exhale. Still sticky, sweet but more of a generic mixed fruit juice taste. Thick mouthfeel, and a lingering stickiness.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  And here's another flavor I don't have a real reference for. I can't really compare it the Vimto inspiration, but there isn't anything here that seems out of place based on the description and nothing that tastes actively offensive.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light. A bit harsh and dry for that much fruit going on.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Seems like a good jump-off for an interesting candy or slush flavor. Thick, syrupy flavor that should texturizers or cooling well.  You could probably throw this in with a bit of FA Oba Oba and have a decent blackcurrant candy.\n\nIn the realm of beverage, I could see mixing this TPA Champagne, or even better FW Pink Champagne. Just added a bit of pink champagne to a tester, and even as a S&V seems like it's moving in a positive direction. Cuts some of the sweetness, moistens it up a bit. The grape notes are working really well the blackcurrant.  That blackcurrant should also work really with gin, cucumber, or mint.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing this seems pretty a linear.  Thin and dry at 1%. 2% is fuller, with some of that syrupy sweetness coming through but it still feels a bit dry and underflavored. 3% is my sweet spot, fairly syrupy but everything seems pretty well in balance. 4% is okay, but maybe a bit sweet, heavy, and warm for me. Seems to be losing a lot of that nuance and that blackcurrant is getting overwhelming. 5% is starting to border on ketchup-y.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nNot a lot in the way of actual notes.\n\n[Here's the product page from Flavouart UK. Description is buried, but: \"The creator of the famous Blackcurrant and Fruit drink came from our home town of Blackburn, so what better way of paying tribute to him than creating a flavour in the same vein. Blackcurrant, fruit, and a little spice makes this a lovely vape anytime of the day.\"](http://www.flavourart.co.uk/blended-flavourings-10ml.html)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

A dry, fragrant floral.\n\nInhale has a softer, violet candy kind of floral note. Relative thin, mostly just top notes without a lot of sweetness.  Exhale has a chalky kind of flat base, but those violet top notes pretty on point. Again, nothing that really reads as sweetness, but the chalkyness keeps it from reading as full perfume.  Top notes linger quite a bit and turn bitter way towards the end of the exhale.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Nah, not really. It's a bit chalky and dry, but shouldn't be a huge issue if you account for it in a mix.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Light, mostly from the dryness but a tiny bit of an citrus zest kind of hit without any real citrus flavor.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Good floral for pairing with creams. The slight chalkiness and lack of green flavor is going to mix really well with some actual body. I'd even put it forward as the floral to mix with really heavy creams and custards if you want to go that route.\n\nI also like this low with brighter citruses, like oranges and tangerines.  Works well with limes, but you'll want something without a ton of zest.  I also like it with spearmint, or vanilla. [INW did the vanilla / violet pairing really well with Purple Rain.](https://redd.it/5kco2j)\n\nI have no personal experience with violet candies, but that seems to be a common recommendation. I think the chalkyness here is going to lend itself to a pastille.\n\n[I found a pretty great blog post about pairing violet that has a lot of ideas that should translate fairly well into vape form.](http://munchingmanuscript.blogspot.com/2010/09/pairing-violet-withstanding-mfk-fishers.html)\n\n**Notes:**  S&V concentration testing, this is weird and bit finicky. I get fairly strong top notes at .25 and .5% but just some raw vg taste like it isn't a fully saturated flavor. .75% is probably the sweet spot, where you get a clear violet but not a lot of weirdness. At 1% starts getting a bit dry and sharp, with a subtle, almost citrus zest kind of punch.  1.5% is getting a touch chalky.  And by 2% I feel like it's almost powdery.  Honestly, I'd keep this low and probably start at .25% and work up to maybe .75% for a primary note.  The lack of base saturation shouldn't be an issue in more complex mixes if you just want to use a touch for an accent flavor.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nNot a lot out there from the usual suspects.\n\n[Thread from VU about turning this into a violet candy.](http://vapingunderground.com/threads/parma-violets.7964/)\n\n[Not a lot of notes on ELR, but some really cool looking recipes.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/5432)\n\n[Good reviews on ECX, along with another Violet candy mention.](http://www.ecigexpress.com/diy-e-liquid/browse-flavorings/herb-spice-flavors/violet-by-flavourart.html)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

    "markdown": "Yes, that's right, Flavour Art has a whipped cream. By the looks of it, it's been out since at least 2010 according to the reviews on ECX. I thought I'd share my notes on them. Also, the only place I've seen that has it is ECX. Anyways, to me I'm getting some airy notes with an actual whipped cream flavor. It's almost like an unsweetened or lightly sweetened whipped cream, and has tasted well in everything I've tried it in. I've come to the conclusion that at about .5% it becomes slightly present, but at .7% (as high as I've tried), it becomes very tasty and pretty strong. It was my blueberry custard that I tried it at .7% though so it may be getting a little stronger because of custards/creams. I'd say if you wanted a perfect whipped cream flavor I'd throw in 2% TFA whipped cream or CaP vanilla whipped cream. It really reminds me of fresh cream in a way but it doesn't take over as much. I haven't checked the MSDS so I'm not sure if there's triacetin in this or not. I do suggest you guys check this out as I've been starting to use it in place of or with other whipped creams as I love the subtle layer of cream this adds. It truely tastes like whipped fresh cream.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FA @ Whisky %2, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 10 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Sweet scotch whisky. I'm retired from the real stuff, so I can't do a side-by-side, but it reminds me a lot of Glenmorangie.  Almost a syrupy calvados kind of apple/pear note with some lighter peat on the exhale.\n\nInhale is warm, thick baked apple/pear without some of the richness you'd expect from the butter and stuff traditionally used for that.  Medium, fruity sweetness and fairly dense.  Exhale starts with more of that fruit with some floral cherry blossom top notes.  Peat comes in on the back half, relatively light and competing with all that fruit and sweetness. No raw alcohol notes, but a definite warmth to the entire thing.  Dense, but with just a hint of astringency from the peat and the floral top notes. Definitely gets pretty syrupy, especially with extended use. Finish is mostly peat with some residual sugary mouthfeel.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Come in expecting scotch, and not too much. Pronounced fruit and sweetness, but not really off from the profile. Just a sweeter scotch.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Not really. Very smooth, all things considered.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Cocktails are the obvious one. Complex enough to work for a single flavor, but should blend well in an application where you can get away with a sweeter scotch.\n\nWarmth and apple/pear/cherry kind of vibe will have some use in bakery applications where people are using TFA Kentucky Bourbon. Not particularly aggressive peat, so it shouldn't stand out too much.\n\nShould pair well at a low percentage in fruit mixes and creams/custards that involve apple, pear or even stone fruit like plums and non-floral peaches.  Peat note is indistinct enough to blend in, while letting you use that syrupy fruit and warmth.\n\nLots of talk about mixing this with FA Oakwood or TFA Red Oak to enhance the barrel aged kind of note you'd get from a more aggressively oaked or traditional whiskey.  It should work, but I think it may be missing what makes this special.  I'd just use FLV Bourbon if I wanted oak char, and leave this stuff alone.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nS&V concentration, .5% is a bit thin for me. 1% seems to add a noticeable warmth and thickness while keeping the sweetness in check. 1.5% has some of the more defined sweet fruit taste, and by 2% you're getting that peat nuance. 2.5% is a bit more aggressive on both the sweetness and the peat. 3% seems to be a good maximum on this, as the vape seems pretty well saturated but a little sharp. Balance falls apart after that, with the fruit reading as white grape juice and the peat having a distracting sharpness. I'd recommend this at 1% for mixing for either warmth or body, and 2.5% as a strong primary note.\n\nI was ready to write this off as a cheaper blended whiskey flavor, and I've been using it as such.  Actually digging in and single flavor testing it, I'm a lot more impressed by some of the nuance here.  This stuff is tasty.  Blew through my entire tester fairly quick, and I'm going to start giving this some serious consideration in the future.  I'm having some flashbacks to being snowed in with a bottle of Glenmorangie and enjoying the hell out of this, so YMMV but It's worth a shot if you're into the profile.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[HIC Notes:](http://mamajsflavorshop.com/headinclouds-my-notes-on-flavor-descriptions/)\n\n\"Tastes like Irish whisky, not sweet like American bourbon.

Light bit of tannic peel. Concentrate doesn't taste a whole lot like 'murican white table grapes, but muscat grapes really don't either.\n\nInhale is relatively light with sharp soapy florals and just a bit of a deeper sweetness. Exhale has some darker, muskier floral grape top notes. Not unpleasant and fairly accurate to grapes of a vine. Jammy base sweetness, leaving a kind of sticky, sugary mouthfeel.  Slight tannic tartness overall, like you'd get from grape skins. Those florals linger quite a bit and get bitter by the end of the exhale.  This concentrate lacks a lot of the mid-range you'd get from a more straight-forward \"purple\" kind of grape flavor.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Definitely has a floral edge to it that can taste a little like hairspray or really cheap wine. 2% is probably pushing it with this concentrate.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light. Little bit of hit on the exhale.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I'd suggest this as a grape additive more than anything else, kind of working like a tiny percentage of lychee would to give a more candy grape flavor some realism from those top notes. This has the added benefit of adding some darker, sweeter, jammy notes along with it.  This isn't really pleasant enough to take center stage in a mix, but may have some use as a general fruit sweetener if you like mixes a bit more complex and interesting.\n\nI'd stay well clear of creams and bakeries. Those floral notes really aren't going to play too well with anything creamy, buttery, or dense.\n\nThat sort of cheap alcohol bite from the florals here should be pretty useful in cocktail vapes that include a brighter wine component.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nS&V Concentration testing, 2% is defintely overkill.  At .25%, this is mostly a subtle grape sweetness.  I'm still getting just a hint of those higher grape florals as well, but overall the flavor is pretty weak.  .5% is actually pretty good. Still not reading overtly \"grape\" but you get a deep grape sweetness and just a bit floral grape top notes. .75% is getting to be a bit more clearly grape, as those top notes fill in. No big bump in sweetness over .5%. 1% is getting floral, and that sweetness underneath is getting jammy. 1.5% is sharper and pushing pretty far floral-forward, but that jammyness is getting pretty full. 2% and over is too floral for me, as the darker sweetness and top notes just seem to be moving farther and farther apart.  I'd start with this at .5% for a general fruit sweetener, and .75% and move up for backup for a more straight-forward grape flavor like INW Grapes.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Hic Notes:](http://mamajsflavorshop.com/headinclouds-my-notes-on-flavor-descriptions/)\n\n\"Tastes like a handful of white wine grapes plucked from the vine and eaten, skin and all. This is very useful for making the flavors of real fruit-juice blends. Look at the ingredients on a 100% juice blend, and you’re likely to see white grape juice in the listing. It does get a little aromatic around 2%, but add 1% or less to sweeten other fruits without adding much grape flavor. For a more neutral fruity sweetener, see FA Pear.\"\n\n[/u/m_i_r_/ says this stuff tastes likes moscato wine, which I could totally see.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/2wpsnr/flavourart_white_grape/)\n\nCouple of other quick mentions on the sub, both in comments for some Grape, WTF? type posts. /u/TheAlmightyD/ calls it \"decent\" [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/3wjf6c/i_need_a_good_grape_or_a_grape_base/)  /u/jacatro/ calls it \"good\" [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/4jt2pk/where_is_all_the_grape/)\n\n[ELR page isn't great, but it does have a mention of this being really similar to FA Lychee.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/218)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FA Zeppola @ %2, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 7 days.\n\n*This concentrate was provided by bullcityflavors.com, for the sole and express purpose of publishing an honest review for r/DIY_eJuice.*\n\n**Flavor Description:** A dry, fluffy cake donut with a good deal of powdered sugar on top.  I could see this passing as a grocery-store bakery take on a beignet.\n\nInhale is mostly powdered sugar. The drier, dense mouthfeel kind of feels like you're actually inhaling powdered sugar, which is a bit disconcerting. Exhale starts with another good helping of powdered sugar on top with a drier cake donut coming through underneath. Overall effect is really sweet, and moderately dense. Back half of the exhale is primarily that cake donut right in the middle of your palate.  Not a lot of low-end oily rich flavor here you'd get from an actual donut, although you do get sort of an oily mouthfeel. Lingering powdered sugar on the exhale. This manages to give you sugar lips while feeling like it's greasing your mouth up a bit. Really interesting.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  So, a zeppole is usually fried, and I'm not getting that.  It's much more of a cake donut taste with a strange oily mouthfeel.  Also, that powdered sugar thing is pretty intense, but probably workable for the profile.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Light solo, mostly from the dryness here.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  If you want a yeast-risen donut, a little FA Joy will do you. That has the yeast, bready body, and slight touch of oil this seems to be missing for a typical yeast-risen american style donut.  /u/ID10-T recommends using TFA Bavarian Cream for some added creaminess and richness, which should also work to round out that noticeable powdered sugar notes.\n\nFrom there, knock yourself out. I'm sure you can figure out something rich and obscene to do with your donuts.\n\nAlso, this is profoundly sweet, and should work as a fairly non-descript sweetener for bakeries as long as it's kept low.\n\n**Notes:** S&V concentration testing, .5% this is a more like the scent from donuts without much mouthfeel. Same kind of taste, just really faint without much body.  Still very sweet, though. 1% really just seems to boost the powdered sugar here, making it a bit dryer and sweeter overall.  1.5%, that cake donut taste is starting come back through, adding some nuance and giving you some of an actual donut as opposed to more of just a whiff of a bakery.  Same thing with 2%, the powdered sugar seems to top out at 1% but that donut base is getting a bit stronger.  Seems to get a breadier as the wicks dry out. At 2.5, the powdered sugar is a little more under control and that donut is taking center stage. Donut is getting some anise/maple kind of top notes.  At 3%, I'm getting some bread out of this but the powdered sugar seems to be muting some of the more \"donut\" taste. At 3.5% and above, the flavor seems to mute a bit more and gets a bit astringent overall.  I'd use this at 1% for a sweetener for bakeries, and probably 2.5% for a donut without added sweet components. I'd bump up to 3% for a donut where you're adding a bit of joy or intend on having a sweet glaze or fruit filling or whatever.\n\nOverall this is good, although a bit dry and definitely heavy on the powdered sugar.  Doesn't give me a zeppole per se, but seems like a really good donut base.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[User Boogenshizzle has great notes on ELR.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/134140)  Seriously, go read them.  Percentage testing and everything.  I disagree mainly in that I get a lot of sweetness here, but super useful.\n\n[Positive reviews on BCF.](http://www.bullcityflavors.com/zeppola-fa/)\n\n[FA Zeppola makes /u/CheebaSteeba 's \"heart sing,\" in the comments for /u/tylurnt1 's Bashful donut posted up a couple days ago.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/5n25sa/bashful_lemon_donut_recipe/)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**\n\nEDIT: /u/ID10-T saved me from recommending a vanilla yeast infection from a combination of FA VC1 and FA Joy.",

Almost buttery in aroma and mouthfeel. I can't say I have had a cream flavor like this. It has no dairy or vanilla or real butter taste to it. Doesn't feel oily in the mouth nor has it got any vegetal notes. I can't put my finger on what it really tastes like. It's not earthy, floral, nor green. It feels delicate and very decadent. If I had to describe this in one word it would be 'elegant.'  A complex aroma that seems like it would fit in more places than not.\n \n**Recommended Pairings**\n\nThis could be a cream base on its own at 3-4%, could see this boosting other cream profiles around 1-2%. \n\n\n* basil\n* butter\n* cucumber\n* this would make an excellent boost to any cream/custard flavor\n* tropical fruits (lychee, mango)\n* citrus fruits (thinking grapefruit or lemon or lime, yum) definitely the more zesty/juicy type flavors\n* some nuts (walnut?)\n* maybe orange/tangerine\n* I wouldn't pair a real avocado with vanilla but this flavor would work with most vanillas out there to make them creamier\n\n**Off Notes**\n\nI cant say anything is really off. It doesn't taste exactly like avocado but nothing is off about it. Avocado is a subtle yet complex sort of buttery thing: this concentrate is that. \n\n**Notes**\n\nI don't know what else to say about this one. This single flavor test is very enjoyable. It's an extremely comforting vape that doesn't attack your palate but rather it caresses it. It's creamy and smooth like a damn avocado. Does not change much over a short steep.\n\n**Second Opinions**\n\n\nseriously could not find anything. please go try this. If I didn't make it clear, this shit is yummy and weird but in the best way\n\n\nEdit: I'm going to just add on that I think this may go with almost any fruit, especially berries.

    "markdown": "*Disclaimer: I didn't pay for these, shoutout to [ECX](http://www.ecigexpress.com/) for sending them to me.*\n\n**Setup:** Recoil w/ flavor barrel, Dual 12 wrap 24g 3.5mm SS316 @.31 ohms. 60w power, 450F temp limit. Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Flavor Express Guava, 1% and 3%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 22 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Sweet guava candy flavor.\n\nSolo, this tastes a lot like the classic red Hawaiian Punch.  I'm getting mostly a sweetened, very \"red\", artificial guava flavor. Flavor itself seems halfway between strawberry and candy watermelon.  There's a moderate tartness and lighter muskiness to offset some of that heavy sweetness, but it's reading more like a candied take on guava.  The flip side of that is that this doesn't seem to some of the funkier, muskier off notes that comes from more realistic versions of Guava.  Nothing that tastes too \"artificial\" besides that really heavy sweetness.\n\nMouthfeel on this is interesting.  It's moderately dense, and kind of sticky.  Somewhere between a syrupy and hard candy kind of mouthfeel.  A lot less sticky than FA Blackcurrant, but from that same genre of candy mouthfeel.  I'm getting some of that familiar FE/SC type of dryness on the tail end of this, but it's relatively restrained as far as those things go.  This is is sweetened to the point where it ends up coming across a little warm and flat, at least for me.\n\nTrying to put this in the context of some of the other guava flavors, this is definitely sweeter than FLV and FA.  Leans more toward CAP Sweet Guava, but if that's more of a guava nectar this is closer to a guava syrup or candy.  It's definitely the sweetest and heaviest guava I've tried.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Not really.  intensely sweet take, but nothing chemical or unpleasant.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light.  That heavy sweetness gets a bit dry and harsh for me right at the end of the vape.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 1% this is pretty indistinct.  more just generic \"red\" than anything else. Sticky but thin mouthfeel.  Sweet, but not cloying yet.  Feels like a less developed candy watermelon.\n\n3% has a bit more nuance.  Substantially sweeter, but that tartness is coming through a bit clearer and this feels less one-dimensional.  Sticky texture, moderately thick, but seems to vape a bit warm for something this candied.\n\nJust based on these tests, I'd be around 2% as a starting point for this as a primary flavor, maybe up to 3% if you really want your mix sweet.  This should work fine as an accent at 1% but I don't really think the guava will come across.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Out of the trinity of Passionfruit, Orange, and Guava making up the elusive POG, the guava is probably the least tricky component.  This seems a little too sweet for POG guava, but it may help to sweeten up a more aggressive and citrusy passionfruit and orange.\n\nThis really reminds me of Hawaiian Punch solo, could probably be filled out with some like TPA Champagne and INW Pineapple for a pretty convincing and still very red Hawaiian punch.  Add some cooling and it could go full juice drink.\n\nGood base for Guava jelly or guava bakeries.  This may need a bit more nuance from FA or FLV guava to come across a realistic, but the sticky mouthfeel already feels like it has some pectin to it.\n\nPair with citruses, or other tropicals.  Guava generally pairs well strawberry, and the candy \"red\" nature of this is going to make a syrupy strawberry like JF Sweet Strawberry or INW Shisha Strawberry feel even thicker and sweeter while the tartness helps it pop a bit.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  I can't find much substantive out there.\n\n[Here's the product page from ECX.](http://www.ecigexpress.com/shop/diy-e-liquid/diy-e-liquid-flavors/flavorsexpress/fruitexpress/guava-by-flavors-express.html)  Their description: \"Guava possesses a unique flavor that is lies somewhere between pear and strawberry.

    "markdown": "**Setup:** Recoil RDA. Dual kanthal clapton coils @ 0.339 ohm. 55w power, Cotton Bacon wicks. \n\n**Testing:** Flavor Express Oak Milk @ 1% to 3% 70/30 VG/PG, Steeped 6 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Thick, rich, sweet condensed milk with a touch of soft caramel and a sort of woody note. My initial impression of this as an odd but delicious \"oak barrel-aged sweetened condensed milk\" might have been an excellent example of the awesome power of suggestion.  Put oak in the name, it tastes like oak. After spending a little more time with this flavor, I'm still going with oak for the top note. It's not unlike the oaky flavor of FA Oakwood. If this were Family Feud, I'm sure the top audience survey result would be oak. But also on there, you'd find the less specific \"woody,\" along with nutty and malty. Whatever connection you make to that arboraceous aspect, the rest is straightforward. Sweetened condensed milk, condensed almost to the point of being chewy, with a lingering soft, sweet caramel finish, not unlike a dulce de leche. \n \n**Off-flavors:** It's a unique flavor. I'm not sure what belongs and what doesn't, but there's nothing weird or unpleasant up to 3%. \n\n**Throat Hit:** Negative. The opposite of throat hit. Silky smooth.  \n\n**Notes:** This is a highly concentrated flavor. At 1%, I'm getting a full-flavored, rich condensed milk between a woody note and a soft, lingering caramelized sweetness on the finish. Although it doesn't bring to mind butter at all, there has to be some diketones at work here for this to be such a rich dairy cream flavor without any buytric barfiness. Pushing it up to 2% doesn't do much for the condensed milk or woodiness, but it turns the hint of caramel into a stronger soft caramel flavor. 3% makes the already thick condensed milk so thick that I would even call it chewy, without bringing out anything off.   \n\n**Uses & Pairings:** I find this to be a fairly complex concentrate that's a satisfying single flavor. But what's the fun in that? The first thing that came mind when I tasted this last night is a creamy RY4-type recipe.  Today I go poking around and it seems others had the same thought. There's not much information out there about this flavor, but two of the three recipes on ELR that use it are RY4s: [Presidential Blend](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/recipe/1146243/Presidential%20Blend) by ecigexpress and one that's someone's [remix of the same](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/recipe/1146317/Presidential%20Blend).  \n\nOther options might be milkshakes/ice creams and bakery stuff, with a caveat. That woody/nutty/malty thing is going to get in the way of some stuff. Tried it in cookie profile where a caramelly condensed milk wouldn't be out of place, and the oak in oak milk went cardboard on me. Like eating a delicious cookie, box and all. However, I think it could easily be folded into a nut with the addition of some nutty flavor or pass as a malt when mixed with chocolate. \n\nCall me crazy, but I could also see putting some vanilla and bourbon flavor with this and making something like a bourbon cream sauce for baked fruit or better yet, New Orleans-style bread pudding.  \n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n*High praise for this flavor, but quite a bit of variation regarding what it actually tastes like*  \n\nELR notes:\n\ndjvapes preferred single flavor is the oddly specific 3.3%. \n\nAmy*** says, \"Use as a sweet cream / milk. I tried it stand alone at 3% max vg and it was great all on it's own. It kinda of has a slight spice to it way deep down not like a Horchata but something on those lines of a spiced milk. Tons of sweet creaminess. I read up on it and it appears that Oak Milk is a common thing in Wales. I am going to try this as a traditional milk and also sneak it in where you'd want an additional layer of depth. Very satisfied with this flavor as a stand alone very surprising being I don't regularly vape single flavors.\"\n\nMlik says, \"3.5%: this is a really nice straightforward cream, not too heavy, not dairy. Malt taste in the front, then a faintly sweet cream that's sort of like a mild soy milk or almond milk. Light mouthfeel, light-medium vapor. So far it works well w/ bakeries (fa cookie esp.), fresh cream, vanilla, chocolate (malted milk?), cinnamon and maple. The longer I vape it, the more I like it. It starts tasting like a lightly sweetened non-dairy whipped cream, maybe made of coconut w/ palm sugar. This stuff is good.\"\n\nECX shoppers suggest 6% to bring out the caramel in this flavor. and use words like cool, silky, smooth, milky cream, wonderful, sweet, and very creamy.   \n\nVictoria says, \"I was worried that vaping a milk flavor would leave that 'spoiled milk' taste like I've experienced before but with Oakwood Milk you get that delicious ice cold milk while eating chocolate satisfaction. Sweet and sexy. Better than dairy milk and not as sweet as malted milk. A beautiful hybrid.\"\n \nK.M. writes, \"I have used this for a couple years now and know this flavor very well. To me, it's a very dense and rich complex cream thats slightly sweet. It's not just a plain milk type flavor but, at the same time, it is very versatile. I almost want to say it's a slightly sweetened, condensed vanilla/almond/rice milk but without a really nutty or strong vanilla note. This is a hard one to describe but if you are a fan of creams, vanilla creams or dessert recipes then you really should give this a try. I rarely go over 3-4% as it is quite rich. I love it and have always been surprised to see it rarely mentioned.\"\n  \nAmy: \"I've been using it as a mixer to just give creams an additional sweetness. It's nice and smooth w/ a wonderful creaminess that has just a touch of sweetness. Hard to describe but the cream is more drier kinda in the range of a condensed milk , dense but in a good way. Certainly an upgrade from the typical dairy milk. I have yet to need to go over 3% in a mix as this flavor is nice and strong at lower %s.\"\n  \nBe sure to check out all of the other great reviews at: \n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**\n\nExcept the one about FA Cookie, that one's just stupid. \n\n**Video Review:** In [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1at2VIATig), the second episode of NOTED, I try this flavor for the first time and talk about it and other related flavors with my co-host /u/CheebaSteeba and temporary co-host /u/Skiddlzninja (filling in for permanent co-host /u/mlNikon who will start this upcoming week).

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Flavor Express Passion Fruit, 1% and 3%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 26 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  More passion fruit nectar than fresh.\n\nFor me, at least,  fresh passion fruit tastes a bit like a mixture of bright raw pineapple and citrus acidity with a sweeter guava base with hints of yellow peach. Commercial passion fruit flavors are heavier on that very \"red\" type of fruit sweetness like guava, and have a much milder version of that tartness.The passion fruit here is relatively easygoing.  There's some tartness here, but it's more accurate to a sweeter passion fruit flavor rather than the pretty intense fresh version of passion fruit.  Given that profile, I think this is fairly accurate.  It tastes like a passion fruit you'd find in one of those fruit nectar drinks or some other kind of canned beverage.\n\nThe off-notes here are interesting.  Despite this being more passion fruit nectar than fresh passion fruit, it still has something that tastes a lot like a peel (even though I'm pretty sure you don't get any peel anywhere in actual passion fruit.)  There's a slightly green, muddy note to the finish, especially at higher percentages.  I'm also getting some some perfumey bitterness above 1%.  Starts to pick up a bit of laundry detergent soapiness after prolonged vaping.\n\nThis is fairly sweet overall.  Not quite passion fruit syrup, but seems artificially sweetened.  Doesn't get too sticky or cloying to me at the percentages I tested.  Not a ton of texture or body here either.  Just thick enough to not come off as astringent with that soapier note.\n\nComparing this to some of the other passion fruits I've tried, the FE Version doesn't have the fresher, tarter hit of FA.  FE doesn't have that pretty intense throat hit, though.  Much closer to the CAP/PUR/FLV end of the spectrum.  This has less flat greeness than CAP.  Seems closest to FLV Passion Fruit, even down to that Super Concentrate kind of thinness.  The flavor of PUR is also really close to the same profile, but I don't get that light soapyness out of PUR, and I feel like the body on that one is a touch more solid.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Light floral and slightly bitter top note.  Slightly green peel note almost like a more restrained mango peel.  Tastes just a little soapy, at least solo.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Moderate, but it's still a lot less intense than FA... so that's something.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 1%, this is recognizably passion fruit but it tastes a bit muddy.  I get more sweet guava than anything bright or acidic.  Florals and soapiness hasn't really shown up yet, but I'm not getting a completely distinct passion fruit.\n\nAt 3%, some of that tartness is starting to show up.  Sweeter, a bit fuller, and with a better flavor saturation.  I am getting some of those floral and peel notes though, and the bitter florals and greener notes make this taste a bit soapy.\n\nJust based on these tests, I'd be using this as an accent around .5-1%. This should work better as an accent flavor, it gets too soapy and floral at the kind of higher percentages you'd need to use to really get it to come across as a primary flavor.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**\n\nShould work well for some vaguely exotic tropical sweetness in fruit mixes.  I'd watch out for overdoing this against guava with that heavy sweetness, papaya with that muskiness, or mango with some of the peel notes in there.  I'd proably stick with orange, banana, or a heavier pineapple flavor like CAP.\n\nPassion fruit works a lot like Guava with strawberries, sweetening and supporting them.\n\nI also like passion-fruit with sweeter stone fruit like peaches or plums.\n\nYou don't see a ton of bakeries or creams with passion-fruit, but this would be a decent choice for something like a pavlova.\n\nSolid choice for beverage passion fruit flavors when you're going after that heavier, sweeter artificial passion fruit.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  I can't find much substantive out there.\n\n[Here's the product page from ECX.](http://www.ecigexpress.com/shop/diy-e-liquid/diy-e-liquid-flavors/flavorsexpress/fruitexpress/passion-fruit-by-flavors-express.html)  Their description: \"Enjoy the fragrantly piquant taste of Passion Fruit by Flavors Express in your next DIY recipe!

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Flavor Express Rainbow Sherbert, 1% and 3%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 20 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Bright, fruity sherbert with a moderately thick base and some light floral weirdness.\n\nAppropriately sherbert-ish fruit base.  Description calls out raspberry, orange, and lemon and I could see it.  Brighter artificial fruit flavors with a slightly chalky edge that meld together well.  Leads with a brighter, tart raspberry type flavor that's going just a bit floral.  Orange comes on next, again on the artificial side, but fairly saturated. Softer orange flavor, fits with the sherbert profile.  I wouldn't pick out the lemon if it wasn't mentioned, but that orange is a bit tarter than I'd expect, so it's probably doing what it needs to do.  Lightly bitter hint of lemon zest after the sweetness dies down from the orange.  That floral note from the raspberry seems to come back after the lemon dies down a bit and kind of lingers on the exhale.\n\nOverall balance between the fruit and cream is pretty good.  Lighter ice cream base, not as thick and buttery as something like a VBIC, but you do get enough richness for the profile.  Cream does a solid job of soaking up those heavier fruit notes without really overselling and tasting like a fruit ice cream as opposed to a sherbet.\n\nMouthfeel here is fairly heavy for the FE/SC genre of flavors.  I'd call it moderately thick overall, but I do get drier thinness toward the end of the exhale as that lemon zest and floral note kicks in harder.  Density seems just a bit frontloaded on the exhale.  Sweet enough to come across as a sherbet.  Tastes a bit sweet and artificial, but stops short of straight candy.\n\n**Off-flavors:** The fruit here is a bit chalky and artificial, which is probably a fit for the profile.  There's also a bit of a lightly chemical, floral edge though.  It shows up right on the tail end of the exhale and leaves a slightly strange, bitter aftertaste.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light to moderate.  Fruit is a bit tart and throaty, but the cream calms it down a bit.\n\n**Percentage testing:** At 1%, this feels a bit fruit heavy.  Tart raspberry and citrus without a ton of body and chalkier feel, and I'm not getting much cream.  Floral notes are pretty restrained overall, but feels just a bit unsatisfying.\n\nAt 3%, some more of that cream shows up and the fruit feels a bit fuller.  Less of that chalky mouthfeel, and more fully saturated.  I am getting more of that bitter, floral off-note from the end of the exhale.\n\nJust based on these tests, I'd probably be using this around 2-2.5%.  I like the vibrancy of the fruit that high even with the floral off notes.  This flavor has a lot going on, feels like more of a primary flavor than something you'd want to use an accent.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  To build this out into a fuller sherbert I'd add a bit of additional cream.  You could go with your VBIC of choice, although CAP or FW would probably be a safer bet just to keep the richness in control.  You could also go with TPA Vanilla Swirl if you wanted to play with that chalky sherbert texture.  You could also add some FA Polar Blast or WS-23 for a colder mouthfeel.  I'd avoid straight Koolada, as that can get a bit cardboard-y up against the chalkier sherbet.\n\nOutside of just a sherbert, it wouldn't be a bad base for a candy using raspberry and orange with some additional sweetening.  Or add it to additional Citrus like CAP Lemon Lime for one of those weird sherbert and 7up punches.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  I can't find much substantive out there.\n\n[Here's the product page from ECX.](http://www.ecigexpress.com/shop/diy-e-liquid/diy-e-liquid-flavors/flavorsexpress/fruitexpress/rainbow-sherbet-by-flavors-express.html)  Their description: \"Enjoy the flavor of sweet cream paired with orange, raspberry, and hints of lemon that is Rainbow Sherbert by Flavors express!\nThis flavor is very versatile and pairs well with other fruit, bakery and custard type recipes!\"\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Flavor Express RY4 Double, 1 and 3%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 18 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Sweetened coffee?  Maybe the \"dessert\" part of a dessert tobacco, but I'm struggling to find any actual tobacco here.\n\nThis tastes a lot like coffee.  I'm sure there are some combinations of tobaccos that come across like coffee, but I'm not getting any smoke, ash, or even a clear leafy flavor.  It's a dead ringer for a medium-dark roast drip coffee with some added sugar.  There's a very slight cocoa edge which starts to come out at higher percentages.  Coffee has just a slight burnt taste to it that conceivably could be where some kind of tobacco is slotting in, but overall effect just tastes like coffee.  Sweetness here has a little bit of a caramel taste, but comes across more like a baseline sweetness to to the entire vape rather than a specific sweet component.\n\nThe mouthfeel is relatively full for a super concentrate type alcohol-based flavor, with some actual volume to it.  Not nearly as thick as TPA, JF, or HS, but I seem to have issues with texture on alcohol-based flavors.  This is still fairly sweet, but that lack of body actual keeps it from getting too sticky and cloying.  It's almost a granulated sugar kind of sweetness but it fades out pretty quickly.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  A whole lot of coffee. Not much in common with the other RY4 flavors I've tried beyond a general lack of tobacco.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Moderate, dry harshness to this.  Doesn't seem to have that warm, scratchy throatiness of other RY4's but it still has a bit of bite.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 1%, I'm getting a pretty full helping of that coffee kind of flavor.  Medium dark and just slightly burnt.  Moderate caramel sweetness without a heavy stickiness.  Texture feels a bit thin.  Moderately harsh and a bit dry.\n\nAt 3%  I'm getting about the same amount of coffee out of this, but it seems to be picking up a bit of cocoa.  Caramel has filled in just a bit, but the texture feels functionally identical and still a little thin.  Hasn't gotten much sweeter, but the harshness and dryness has picked up for me.\n\nJust based on these tests, I'd probably be around 2% with this flavor.  I've tried mixing super concentrates with PG based concentrates, and the super concentrates tend to get pushed into the background of mixes.  So I think this is probably going to work better in an accent role, unless you want to go full super concentrates.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I'm not sure about this about a tobacco flavor.  I think you could use it as a component in a desert tobacco, but you'll want to pair it with a more aggressive tobacco and this is just going to bring a sweet coffee vibe to the mix.\n\nTaken on it's own terms, it's really not a bad, sweet coffee.  This could use some cream to thicken it a bit, but it doesn't need much beyond that.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  I can't find much substantive out there.\n\n[Here's the product page from ECX.](http://www.ecigexpress.com/shop/diy-e-liquid/diy-e-liquid-flavors/flavorsexpress/tobaccoexpress/ry4-double-by-flavors-express.html)  Their description: \"RY4 double brings twice the unique and delicious flavor of tobacco paired with hints of caramel and vanilla to your DIY recipe.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Flavor Express Sun Seed, .5% and 1.5%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 19 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Salty, raw sunflower seeds.\n\nFlavor here is very close to raw sunflower seeds.  The base of the flavor has a moderate sort of indistinct sweet nuttiness to it, but the top notes really sell it.  It has a green raw seed taste to it.  There's maybe just the slight hint of earthiness to it, but it feels more heavily weighted toward that strangely authentic seed-ish flavor.  It's probably a bit more nutty than seed-ish, but that seed note sticks out quite a bit.\n\nI also get something salty out of this.  It feels a lot like the type of salty sensation in some of the heavier nut flavors like FLV Beer Nuts.  It's attached to a pretty distinct flavor, so it's going to be a challenge to try to get that salt out by itself, but whatever they are doing actually feels salty to me.  I feel it the most on my lips, like I've actually been eating too much salty food, so maybe it is just some sort of saline.\n\nTexture here is interesting.  While I get a fairly clear nutty flavor out of this, I get basically no crispier texture.  There's a moderately full sweetness in the base, but there isn't anything that feels hard or crunchy to it.  I have issues with super concentrates and texture, but it's fairly jarring getting that from a nutty flavor.  This is also quite a bit sweeter than you'd expect from this sort of raw sunflower seed flavor.  Due to the lack of texture, feels almost like a white sugar sweetened sunflower seed.\n\nFWIW, the room note here is a trip.  Pretty dead on to sunflower seeds.\n\n**Off-flavors:** No harder, nutty texture.  Seems a bit sweet for the greener seed notes.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Moderate.  Whatever's gone salty here is also a bit rough on the throat.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At .5%, I get some nuttiness and a relatively restrained kind of green seed flavor.  I'm not getting anything in the way of texture, but it's a bit on the sweet side.  Has something that feels a lot like a moderate salty bite.\n\nAt 1.5% there's a bit more texture.  The nuttiness is a bit deeper and warmer, and that greener seed flavor is more prominent.  Sweetness and whatever's passing for salt feel just a little more intense.\n\nPercentage on this tricky.  I've used this up to 3% and it works fine... it just tastes a whole lot like sunflower seeds.  This flavor is going to act a lot like sesame, where it just sticks out in recipes when it's used at any kind of appreciable percentage.  If you want to actually taste sunflower seeds, based on these tests, I'd suggest around 2%.  If you want to try to sneak some of this into a recipe as slight nutty accent then I'd suggest below .25%.  I've also tried this down at .05%, and while I don't get anything that actually feels like a full flavor, it does taste like a nutty, sweet VG.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  If you want to use this as a full flavor, it's going to be hard to get away from the green part of the nuttiness here. It seems like a cop out, but I'd probably go tobacco where that green can play with those leafy notes a bit.\n\nUsing it for that more mild nuttiness at low percentages, could be layered in to fill out nuttier concentrates.  Fresh seems to be using it for that purpose at .15% in his [\"Nuttin﻿ Butt Fun (Fluffer Nutter)](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/recipe/1878805/Nuttin%EF%BB%BF%20Butt%20Fun%20%28Fluffer%20Nutter%29) along with FLV Peanut Butter.  Additionally, ECX released a [Mango Sticky Rice](https://www.e-cigarette-forum.com/threads/weekly-recipe-mango-sticky-rice.824383/] using Sun Seed at a whopping .02% to concievably add some nuttiness to the rice base.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  I can't find much substantive out there.\n\n[Here's the product page from ECX.](http://www.ecigexpress.com/shop/diy-e-liquid/diy-e-liquid-flavors/flavorsexpress/fruitexpress/sun-seed-by-flavors-express.html)  Their description: \"Add the authentic and delicious taste of freshly roasted sunflower seeds to your next DIY recipe!

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Flavor Express Sweet Grape, 1% and 3%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 21 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  White grape juice, with some aloe notes.\n\nThe description calls out a candy grape, but this tastes a lot more like a white grape flavor.  Fairly heavy lychee-esque white grape right up front of the vape.  Greener notes start to come in after that, with a tarter, lightly astringent white grape skin bordering on an almost aloe flavor.  There is a bit of a sweeter, almost candied grape in the base but the top of the flavor is pretty identifiably white grape.\n\nThose greener notes here get a little aggressive.  It has a bit of a cheap shampoo or aloe drink kind of taste to it. Nothing too intense, but there is just a bit of a bitter floral note on that shows up on the tail end of the exhale.  Not nearly as perfumey FA White Grape. Similar to FLV Moscato, but maybe a bit less tart and rhubarb-esque than that can get.\n\nThis is fairly sweet for a fruit flavor, but it doesn't have a heavy, warm jolly rancher sweetness.  More of a sweetened juice drink sweetness.  Lighter mouthfeel with some actual juiciness in here, but does seem to dry out a bit on the tail end of the exhale, at least for me.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Greener notes on that white grape.  Totally standard for white grape flavors, but ends up tasting a bit like a cheap riesling with just a tiny bit of a fruity cheap shampoo in there.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light.  Base of the flavor is fairly smooth and juicy but I get a bit of dry harshness on the tail of the exhale.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 1%, this is a pretty solid if light white grape juice flavor.  Soft, slightly juicy mouthfeel.  Flavor seems a little undersaturated but good balance of sweeter \"grape\" and tarter white grape notes.  Green notes are working more as an accent.\n\nAt 3% this is substantially greener.  Fuller mouthfeel and a heavier sweetness.  I'm getting some of that shampoo off note.\n\nJust based on these tests, I'd probably be mixing with this as a accent flavor at around 2% to avoid most of those green notes.  Not really going to have the body for a primary note there.  If you really wanted to go green and tart with it, I'd bump it to 4%.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  There are numerous options for a more punchy, convincing candy grape so I'd probably skip trying to turn this into one by itself.  Low percentages may be useful in adding some tartness into those candy flavors though.\n\nSeems like more a fit for the background of fruit blends to add some juiciness and sweetness.  Should pair well with other grapes, apples, and pears without calling too much attention to itself.  I could also see this working well behind harsher citrus to smooth them out and bulk them up a bit.\n\nOr hey, use it fill out that aloe drink vape you've been working on.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  I can't find much substantive out there.\n\n[Here's the product page from ECX.](http://www.ecigexpress.com/shop/diy-e-liquid/diy-e-liquid-flavors/flavorsexpress/fruitexpress/sweet-grape-by-flavors-express.html)  Their description: \"Sweet Grape by Flavors Express is a perfect candy grape flavor for those looking to emulate grape soda or grape candy type mixes in their next DIY recipe.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Flavor Express Sweet Orange, 1% and 3%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 25 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Closer to mandarin, but bright and sweet with a thinner body.\n\nI'd probably call this a mandarin type flavor, but it does add some more orange-like complexity.  I get some slightly bitter pithy notes that seem more like an orange, but it's not enough to really drag it into underripe or dry.  There's some relatively minor orange peel oil kind of sharpness, but it avoids getting too harsh.  The body of the flavor is all mandarin though, with a relatively smooth and intensely sweet body. Overall effect isn't quite realistic to an actual fruit, but comes closer to an oversweetened juice realism.\n\nI'm not getting much body of this.  Feels relatively top heavy, with a brighter citrus in top notes but not a whole lot in the base besides a relatively heavy mandarin sweetness.  Accurately named on the \"sweet\" part.  Sweeter than the tangerines I'm used to, but it's a pretty neutral sugar type of sweetness with no chalkiness or darker caramel notes. Both the sweetness and lack of that heavier orange juice mouthfeel lean towards something like a light syrup body. I get just a really light waxiness out of this, but it's not nearly as waxy and dense as something like FA Mandarin.  It really only starts to get noticeable on dryer wicks after the bright citrus stuff has already been atomized.\n\nI've had some issue with brighter citrus super-concentrate type flavors fading over time, but for the most part this one has actually held up pretty well.  I'm almost a month out and I'm not noticing a huge difference between a freshly mixed sample and the steeped version.  I'm missing some of the distinctly orange pithy bitterness in the steeped sample so it's even closer to a mandarin.  Reads a bit like mandarin segments in syrup.  I'd say it's also lost maybe a half-step in vibrancy but there's a bit more of a waxy body.\n\nClosest direct competition to this would Super Concentrates Mandarin, but that basically comes across as straight Tang down to the slightly chalky texture.  Flavor Express Sweet Orange tastes fuller and less dry to me, and I'm getting a more realistic citrus out of it.  This is less waxy and heavy than FA Mandarin and feels a bit brighter and tarter.  Conversely though, It feels a bit more solid and less harsh than FW Tangerine.  Less tart than FLV Tangerine, but this is definitely sweeter and has less of an aggressive peel note.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  More mandarin than orange, and probably a bit sweet for actual fruit.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Moderate, but really manageable for a bright citrus flavor.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 1% this feels tart and thin.  Seems a bit undersweet to carry those more aggressive citrus notes solo. Doesn't feel quite fleshed out.\n\nAt 3% this sweeter, and while still not heavy it has a fuller body.  Doesn't feel much more tart or aggressive than 1%. Starting to go mandarins in syrup and picking up just a bit of wax.\n\nJust based on these tests, I'd be using this around 3-4% as a primary flavor with the caveat that it might have a bit of a throat hit without something to smooth it out.  I'd be down around 1.5% as an accent flavor.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Good mandarin/tangerine for fruit mixes.  Not waxy enough to be distracting, and not too harsh to use without a ton of smoothing that dulls out your other fruit.\n\nBright enough to stand up to creams.\n\nCould also work fairly well with a heavier candy base.\n\nCould be used as an accent to make oranges a bit more vivid and sweet without completely turning them candied.  Could also be a missing link into turning an orange flavor with enough thickness to carry orange juice into something sweeter and more vibrant. \n\n**Second Opinions:**  I can't find much substantive out there.\n\n[Here's the product page from ECX.](http://www.ecigexpress.com/shop/diy-e-liquid/diy-e-liquid-flavors/flavorsexpress/fruitexpress/sweet-orange-by-flavors-express.html)  Their description: \"Enjoy the citrus taste of sunshine in a bottle with Sweet Orange by Flavors Express!

It's a clean white rice, creamy and sweet. I get what I believe is a heavy thick cream, not pudding or custard. The sweetness is not a sugar nor a sweetener flavor itself. It's very similar to a sweet cream with a little more sweetness. I almost get a hint of butter, not sure at this point if it's actually part of the flavor or texture. The mouth feel is a full bodied and textured creamy rice.

This is the rice I have been looking for to complete my rice pudding, and so far is adding the rice body and creamy texture to TFA Horchata Smooth during the pudding testing. I surprisingly liked this single flavor, but it would be also be great with a dab of butter and cinnamon for a warm bowl of creamy rice cereal.\n",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Acai @ 1% and 1 drop per 10 ml (about .25%), 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 10 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** A lightly tart, dark berry flavor with a cocoa finish.  Slightly dry, soft flavor with much in the way of sweetness or juice to it.  Well balanced overall. No single part of this is really overwhelming, although it seems like the kind of flavor that will be really easy to pick out in a mix.\n\nInhale is tart and a bit acidic with a dry flat bluebery sweetness. Moderately dense, even at low percentages. Exhale has a really soft dark berry flavor up front.  The  base of the berry here tastes flat and muted, without a ton of body to it. Some errant tartness in the top notes, but not nearly as acidic as the inhale.  No real floral edge here, at least at these percentages. Back half of the exhale is solid cocoa for me.  Not a powdery hot chocolate mix kind of note, and not the really agressive cocoa of something like FA Cocoa.  More like a cocoa nib. Overall effect isn't terribly sweet, but it isn't dry enough to be completely astringent or anything.  Lingering cocoa on the palate.\n\n**Off Flavors:**  Did you know that real Acai apparently has a cocoa note to it? I had no idea.  I've never had a straight acai berry, it's always been in a juice blend or covered in chocolate.  I had always assumed that it was all tartness, I had no idea the actual fruit kind of tasted like chocolate. So, it's not really an off note but more of a teaching moment for me?\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light.  There is a bit of an acidic, tart edge to that berry flavor.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I'd primarily use this as a bridge between berry and chocolate flavors. I think the cocoa here is probably enough to read as the cocoa component for a lighter chocolate mix solo, so you'd be free to use something with less mouthfeel issues like FW White Chocolate to bring in the cocoa butter.  The berry here is also fairly unobtrusive and work well to reinforce blueberries, raspberries, or strawberries.  I've messed around with chocolate and berry mixes before, and half the battle is getting a clear chocolate flavor that won't absolutely destroy your coils. 10 ml in and I still don't have any noticeable coil gore and it doesn't seem to suffer from any kind of pronounced chalkiness at 1% and under.\n\nThis is going to be a bit harder to work in a situation where you just want either berries or chocolate. I think both of those flavors really tend to come out in mixes, so this may be a better flavor for a fairly limited niche as opposed to a more versatile straight berry or chocolate flavor.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nS&V concentration testing, another fairly potent flavor from Flavorah with a fairly narrow band of usefulness. At .25% this flavor is just a bit too soft and indistinct. The berry and the cocoa kind of mush together into a slightly odd soft mix. At .5% I'm getting a clear seperation on the berry and cocoa. Still lacking a bit of punch, but it feels like a complete flavor. .75% has a noticeable tartness on the berry. 1% is getting a touch acidic. The body of the berry is still fairly soft and sitting in the background. Cocoa is definitely there but not overwhelming.  1% is getting a bit sour and acidic up front.  The inhale is getting a bit too aggressive solo. Cocoa seems unchanged from .75%. 1.5% is getting too acidic up front and the cocoa is a bit chalky. I'd start with this at .5 or .75% and work up to maybe 1.25% if you really want the tartness of the acai to show up in a mix.\n\nFWIW, the cocoa here is super noticeable in the actual smell of the concentrate and the vapor.  The significant other walked into the room and immediately picked it out.  I'm currently visiting family and took a bunch of fruitier concentrates to test in some sealed tupperware. It was driving me nuts trying to figure out where that chocolate smell was coming from.  I found it, It was the Acai all along.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nNah, not really.  I couldn't find anything all that useful.\n\n[Here's the product page from Flavorah.  Their description: \"Tart red berry, crisp and dry. Acai is a light flavor that can be added as a top note or subtle note on a base. Not a base flavor in itself, but good to add dimensions to a full bodied flavor that needs high end zip.\"](http://store.flavorah.com/concentrated-acai-flavor)  I mean, they make the flavor and all that, but I can't say I really agree with that product description. I don't get an overwhelming tartness and there is quite a bit of softer round flavor rather than crisp. Also, they don't mention that cocoa note going on here either and I think that's a pretty defining characteristic.\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

    "markdown": "##**FLV Alpine Strawberry**##\n\n*Summary*  \nA very powerful, crisp, floral strawberry note. Almost cooling. I'd say it's not so much that it tastes floral, as much as it is that it hits you in the same spot that a floral would (if that makes sense). I feel this may be a good strawberry for folks that have trouble tasting strawberry (although I cannot confirm this since I can taste strawberry). Makes for a great top note, but does not work well with creams/custards, so you will need to most likely pair this with florals, tobaccos, earth notes, other fruits etc.\n\nSo, let's address the elephant in the room: the price point. This is easily the most expensive concentrate I've worked with. Typically with super expensive concentrates, they are super concentrated. This one is moderately concnetrated, being used in most of my recipes from 0.5%-1.5%. It doesn't pair with typical Strawberry pairings as well, but it is surely one that will not fade out on you. I love the actual flavor of this concentrate, but I can imagine that this type of strawberry flavor is not for everyone.  \n\nIt's hard for me to recommend this one way or the other. For me, I'm not too concerned with price as long as I enjoy the flavoring, so for someone like me it's a great addition to your flavor arsenal; for others it will be very hard to justify spending what is basically an entire orders budget on one flavoring. \n\n**On the Nose**  \nSharp crisp strawberry note; strong chemical smell.  \n\n##DO NOT FINGER TASTE OR WATER-TASTE THIS FLAVOR!!  \n\n**Recommended Usage**  \n*Stand alone*: 1%-2%\n\n*In a mix*: 0.5%-1.5% \n\n**Throat**  \nMild to Moderate.

I think this is the greatest feature of this flavor is how far it can push a strawberry flavor to the front. ",

    "markdown": "*This a a pre-release flavor, which was provided to me solely for the purposes of review.*\n\n**Setup:** Recoil w/ flavor barrel, Dual 15 wrap 26g 3mm Nifethal 70 coils @.16 ohms.  60w power, 450F temp limit. Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Amaretto Sour, .25, 1, and 3%, others noted, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 6 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Sweet, heavy cherry-inflected amaretto with a citrus hit when mixed fresh. Steeped, pushes toward a sweeter black or maraschino cherry liqueur type flavor with a little bit of cooling.\n\nMixed fresh, you do pick up a little bit of the almond from amaretto.  It's interesting, because I wouldn't really call this or amaretto exactly nutty.  I think amaretto is generally made with bitter almonds or other stone fruit pits, which have that same kind of cherry note that you get in almond extract and stuff like marzipan.  So it's more of a bitter almond liqueur, than the nuttier taste you'd expect just by saying almonds.  It's almost a maraschino cherry note, which actually works pretty well with sour mix here and kind of evokes a splash of that bright red maraschino cherry liquid in with the cocktail.  There doesn't seem to be any heavy medicinal or plastic off-notes with the cherry-ish flavor in here, so that's a positive.\n\nThe amaretto here feels like it's being taken even further in a cherry direction by that sour mix component, especially after a steep.  The kind of sour mix that's usually used in amaretto sours is a bit of a misnomer, it's much more of a lemon-lime sweetener and this is pretty accurate to that sweet, comes in a big plastic bottle, kind of bar sour mix.  Fresh, you do get some separate lemon and lime notes but there's still a pretty aggressive syrupy sweetness. After a steep, those more distinct citrus notes just fold themselves into that more cohesive sweet cherry-ish flavor.\n\nThis is fairly true to the profile, in that there isn't much booze here.  A real amaretto sour is basically a hangover in a glass without too high of an alcohol content.  This seems to bear that out. Fresh, I do get something that tastes like a lighter, dark liqueur booze towards the back, but it fades out on a bit on the steep.\n\nThere's some noticeable cooling in this. Feels like a bit of a koolada-ish edge,  If I had to ballpark it, feels like about a .15% kind of Koolada hit.  It's light, and nowhere close to icy, but it's definitely in there.  There's a warmth here as well, and that contrast is interesting.\n\nSweeter, syrupy texture to this. I wouldn't call it juicy, but it actually fairly wet.  It's a bit on the cloying side for me, but amaretto sours are crazy cloying, so you can't really knock it there I guess.\n\nMy biggest concern with this is that it seems to flatten out noticeably on the steep.  I like this quite a bit more fresh off the shake than I do after a week steep. It's quite a bit more vibrant, and it has a bit more of an edge to it, doing a better job of capturing the modest amount of alcohol in an actual amaretto sour.  I don't think the overall flavor gets too light, but it loses the light alcoholic bite and that citrus is less interesting.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Not really? Amaretto sours are intensely sweet and profoundly odd tasting, and I think mostly hits the profile, at least freshly mixed. I do have those concerns about this flattening out after a steep, but nothing really tastes out of place or chemical even after that.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Feels fairly light and smooth to me, but this seems like one of those flavors that is going to end up on the harsh side for people that have major throat hit issues with cherry volatiles.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  These are all my steeped samples, I've already noted the changes between fresh and steeped above.\n\nAt .25%, the flavors there, but it's a bit light, thin, and throaty. I don't really pick up the cooling in here, but it does have a sticky warmth to it. Mostly a warm, almost bakery cherry flavor down here.\n\nAt 1%, this is a lot more present.  Sticky sweet, and that cooling is starting to come in a bit more. Flavor is quite a bit bolder, but I'm still not getting anything like booze. This is feeling a lot like cheap maraschino cherry syrup with just a bit more a caramel sweetness. \n\nAt 3%, this is heavy, smooth, and really sweet. A whole lot of darked cooked cherry, light almond, and some subtle lighter and brighter citrus accents. Fairly cloying, but nothing off on the profile.  The cooling on the back end helps clean it up a bit, but it's a distinct cooling note up this high.\n\nThis is interesting, I think it could be used as an additive sub 1%, and closer to 2-3% as a primary note.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Hey, you could pull the bar trick and mix this with cola for something fairly close to a dr. pepper. Sweetness here would fit in a soda profile well, and steeped there isn't enough booze to really distract from a straight soda profile.  With another, brighter cherry on top you may even be able to go towards something like a cherry coke.\n\nI've used marzipan to try to boost up bakery cherry notes. I think this would well for that, but with a texture that's a bit more conducive to a filling. The light cooling in here gives me some pause, but it doesn't seem to be all that prominent at lower accent percentages.\n\nYou could probably mix this with a TPA Kentucky Bourbon to get some non-specific alcohol bite on the back end, or an oakier bourbon for an old fashioned, with a heavy hit of orange. Or hey, use this a stand-in for cherry heering in a blood and sand with FA Whisky.\n\nThis is a surprisingly solid, sweet S&V solo at 3%.  It actually does a better job of being an amaretto sour before a steep.\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

It's been out of production for a minute now.*\n\n**Setup:** Recoil w/ flavor barrel, Dual 15 wrap 26g 3mm Nifethal 70 coils @.14 ohms.  60w power, 450F temp limit. Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Apple, .25, 1, and 3%, others noted, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 6 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  A pretty straight-foward sweeter apple juice type flavor.\n\nThe apple here is pretty middle-of-the-road, in a good way.  There's some sweeter red apple type body, with some tarter, slightly grassy green apple notes in there. Apple juice sweet without tasting overtly candied.  The body here is pretty mellow overall, but that green apple top end can get a bit harsh and grassy.  Not in the same league as the more intense, realistic green apple flavors, but it creeps in.  Very little green apple jolly rancher candy vibe to it.\n\nThis is probably Flavorah's most fuji-esque apple.  It doesn't have the crispness, snap, or peel note that FA or JF have.  It's probably closer to Capella's fuji, but it isn't as juicy.  The texture here is just a bit dry and kind of has an ethyl-maltol/cotton candyish body.  Not aggressively dry, and it doesn't have that spicy peel note of FA Fuji.  Kind of reminds me of a less vivid and juicy INW Two Apples.\n\nA lot of greener apple flavors have a weird tinge of funk (technical term.) I wouldn't call it full on butryic, but it has just a bit of sort of barnyard off-flavor living around with grassier flavors.  It's not incredibly prominent here, and it usually steeps off okay, but it's a bit odd.  I'm not used to tasting with a sweeter, more mellow apple body, but it seems like there is just a touch of it in here, especially mixed fresh.  6 days out i'm barely picking it up, but it was a bit stronger fresh.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  The tarter part of this gets a bit grassy, especially without steeping. Mouthfeel is a bit dry for the apple juice-ish flavor.  Light barnyard funk mixed fresh.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Moderate fresh, calms down to a lighter throat hit on a moderate steep.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At .25%, there's actually a decent amount of flavor here, although it's definitely on the thin and dry side.  Seems more heavily balanced toward the green side of the apple equation.\n\nAt 1%, this still feels a bit strong on the green apple side.  I'm actually getting a touch of jolly rancher here, as that deeper base hasn't really filled out and I think I'm mostly just getting the sweetness and not the nuance from it.  Still on the dryer side, but nothing spicy or peel-ish.\n\nAt 3%, I'm getting more of that apple juice type body and that green apple is back to an accent. Sweetness isn't that much higher than 1%, but it's fuller here. Body actually feels a bit less dry here.  Seems to be working better as a single flavor up here.\n\nJust based on these tests, I'd probably mix with this as a tarter apple layer around .75-1%,  A full green apple around 1.5%, and a apple juice type flavor at 3-4%.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I'd primarily use this as a layering apple to bring in some relatively realistic but not overbearing green apple tartness to softer apples like CAP Fuji Apple.\n\nIf you add some moisture back in here with FA Pear you could do a solid apple juice flavor.\n\nGood apple flavor to fill out HS Apple Mix or FLV Apple Cider without making them feel too watery.\n\nThere are a whole lot of apples, and while this is a relatively solid solo apple flavor I'm not sure it really stands out in an extremely crowded field.  A lot of what this does at a higher percentage could be down either through layering of cheaper apple flavors or a lower percentage of INW Two Apples.\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Apple Cranberry @ 1% and 1 drop per 10ml (about .25%), 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 15 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Juicy red apple with a bit of a candy sweetness and some harsh cranberry on the back end.  The apple is a bit sweeter and softer than something like FA Fuji.  The cranberry veers closer to a sharper, floral cranberry like TFA Cranberry, instead of the juicier normal FLV Cranberry.\n\nInhale is sharp and a bit harsh.  Moderately dense, and fairly heavy on a sharper apple sweetness.  Base of the exhale has a good take on a sweet, juicy red apple.  Higher cranberry top notes, sharp and floral, really showing on the back half of the exhale. Cranberry here is harsh and a bit chemical. Concentrate is heavier on the apple, but that cranberry is really sharp and manages to mar the exhale pretty effectively. Juicy mouthfeel before that harshness comes in. Sweet and moderately dense.  Lingering high, harsh sting.\n\n**Off Flavors:** Sharp, harsh almost rubbing alcohol kind of edge to the cranberry on the back end. It's not too overwhelming overall, but I'm inclined to think it's contributing to the throat hit here.  It could be some actual ethyl alcohol or something in here, but it's noticeable at .25% after a two week steep, so I'm calling it part of the flavor.  \"Breathing\" or anything else to mellow it out is going to mess around with the rest of the concentrate.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  The achilles heel here, I really like the way this tastes but it's pretty harsh.  I'd say an 8 out of 10 if you want numbers attached.  I've tried some EM to calm it down, and it kind of works... but it ruins some of the balance here.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Pretty good start for a cider or something similar, especially when mixed with FLV Apple Cider (Booze) or HS Apple Mix (Non-booze.)\n\nSeems a bit harsh for creams.  A higher percentage of a cream may help to smooth out this concentrate a bit. I don't want to sound too much like a shill, but FLV Cream may work. It has a tendency to mute sharper flavors, and it would let more of that red apple come through.\n\nUsed as backup, interesting note for a fruit mix. Sweet red apple and a bit of tartness from the cranberry. Mixing with one of the TFA Strawberries should mute out some the sharpness from the cranberry.  Also seems like a good paring for raspberries, and FLV Cranberry.\n\n**Notes:**  S&V concentration testing, .25% seems a bit weak. Still getting a good amount of sweetness and the harshness is pretty well in check.  Apple flavor is a bit indistinct though. .5% has a brighter, fuller apple.  A bit more harsh. 1% has a really solid apple base, but the throat hit of the cranberry is getting intense and getting a bit of an alcohol sting.  At 1.5%, the cranberry is getting too floral, and the throat hit is too much solo.  I'd use this at .5-.75% as a supporting flavor or maybe 1-1.25% if you want to use this a primary note and you have something in the mix to smooth this out a bit.\n\nSeems like a bit of a missed opportunity, because the apple here is really good... but that cranberry is harsh and has a bit of an alcohol edge to it.  This would have been a whole lot better if you had a cranberry effect like the straight FLV Cranberry.  That would end up being more a sweeter cran-apple juice thing, as opposed to having to fight the harshness on the back end of this concentrate.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nNothing I can find.\n\n[Here's the product page from Flavorah.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Apple Filling @ 1% and 1 drop per 10ml (about .25%), 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 13 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Whole lot of bakery cinnamon with some apple filling in there. Definitely cinnamon forward. Cinnamon here tastes really similar to FLV Rich Cinnamon but a lot less aggressive at the same percentages.  The apple filling doesn't have a clear apple flavor, but a very commercial, gelatinous apple-esque filling you get in mcdonald's apple pies.  Warm and slightly sticky mouthfeel. Not overwhelmingly sweet for a pastry filling type of flavor.\n\nInhale has dominant, spicy bakery cinnamon.  Apple sweetness in there, but it's a lighter flavor on top of a heavy, dense vape.  Exhale is actually really similar to the inhale here. Spicy bakery cinnamon on top and that same light, super baked, apple flavor coming hrough underneath. Baked to the point of just being a vaguely apple sweetness. Not blindingly sweet, but sweet enough to pull off a filling fairly well. Mouthfeel is warm and gelatinous. Lingering stickiness on the lips.  Does the really commercial apple pie filling thing where it evokes apples as opposed to really tasting like them. The cinnamon here is aggressive and sticks with you for a bit.\n\n**Off Flavors:**  A lot of cinnamon for the amount of apple here. Doesn't really taste off, but out of balance.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Well, there's a good deal of cinnamon in here, so it definitely has a spice and bite to it. Nothing unexpected though.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  So yeah. Apple filling. It's still pretty cinnamon forward so you'll want to add a softer non-candy apple, but the mouthfeel and warmth here pulls off an apple filling pretty well.  Primary use will be apple pie and all of the myriad bastardizations thereof.  Also good for a baked apple base.  Apple is subtle enough that adding some pear flavor will pretty easily drag it into a baked pear.\n\nThis seems like an awesome pairing with a sweet, caramel RY4 tobacco. The relative mellowness of the apple and the gelatinous as opposed to juicy mouthfeel should complement a drier, spicy tobacco instead of just making the mix taste soggy.\n\nAlso reminds me of an apple pie moonshine I used to get from friends back in the day. I kind of want to put whiskey in this.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing,  I get almost no apple at .25% and .5%.  Just a light fruity sweetness, thick mouthfeel, and clear bakery cinnamon. .75% gets a bit more apple to it, but its still cinnamon dominant. 1% is even heavier on the cinnamon, but the warmth from the apple is starting to come through and the mouthfeel is doing a better job of pulling off a filling.  1.5% is about as heavy as I want the cinnamon, but the apple is still a bit weak.  I think the limiting factor for this concentrate is the strength of that cinnamon.  I'd recommend starting at .75% and adding another apple like Fuji or even better INW Two Apples to get a clear apple flavor.\n\nSeems more useful as a mouthfeel and warmth additive for an apple filling rather than a standalone apple filling, at least with the intended bakery uses.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Couple of notes on ELR.  User \"FPSpy\" reports this is really strong and mostly cinnamon: \"So powerful, no apple, but full of cinnamon... It is the cooked jelly part of apple pie as its name apple filling. Couldnt use more than %0.5 in any of my recipes... Cannot be used as a single flavour, apple + pie or cake needed. To me this flavor is not apple filling but cinnamon filling.\"  User \"Brian_SFL\" still comments on cinnamon but seems a bit more positive \"smells like mcdonald's apple pie filling. ... and after steeping it is awesome. (think it has rich cinnamon built in, but not too much.)\"](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/116172)\n\n[Here's the product page from Flavorah.  Their description: \"Grandmas' apple pie filling.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Apple Pop @ 1% and 1 drop per 10 ml (about .25%), 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 9 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Not really a full apple flavor. More like sweetened apple peels. Based on other available concentrates, I'd call this a mashup of that drier, sweetened powdered instant cider note from HS Apple mix, the candy sweetness I get from FA Fuji, and the spicy peel note from TPA Quince.\n\nInhale has a lot of volume with slightly dry, sugary \"apple juice\" kind of candy sweetness.  Exhale has a deep sweet candy red apple base.  Pronounced spicy dry peel notes.  Again, lots of volume without being very dense. Sweetness has a powdered instant cider character to it. Lingering sugar lips and dryness from the peel here.\n\n**Off Flavors:** The peel / skin note is pretty pronounced and a bit spicy. Fairly accurate, but a bit jarring in a sweeter apple flavor.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light, more from the dryness of that cidery apple sweetness and the spicier peel.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:** Flavorah suggests this to add dimension to complex apple flavors, and that seems like a pretty decent idea.  I've used TPA Quince to add a realistic peel note to an apple, but this seems like a better fit. It's a fuller at low percentages, and the apple here has a clearer, brighter flavor. Should work well to complement a crisper apple flavor.  A bit sweet, but should have the same effect with pears.\n\nGood way to add some apple juice sweetness to a fruit mix.  I'd watch the peel and avoid dryer fruit flavors, but should work well in the background of brighter, juicy fruit flavors.\n\nA bit too much peel to work well with creams as a primary fruit note.\n\n**Notes:**  S&V concentration testing, keep this low.  At .25% I get a softer apple sweeteness and a pretty restrained dry, spicy, peel note. .5% has a more candy edge to the apple, but that peel note is ramping up pretty quickly. .75% is drier and spicier than .5% without much added depth or sweetness. By 1% the peel is pretty dominant, although the apple underneath is still a prety mellow, sweet candy flavor. 1.5% takes that dry peel note too far.  I'd start with this at .25% for an accent note for other apple flavors, and .5% for an apple flavor in a fruit mix without another prominent apple flavor.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nNot a ton.\n\n[/u/chewymidget/ posted a downright opulent strap-on using all flavorah.

    "markdown": "*FLV has provided this flavour, along with the other pre-release concentrates for the purpose of testing and review*\n\n**Set-up** - Plume Veil RDA with dual 7 wrap 24g round wire, vaped at 45 watts.\n\n**Testing** - 1.5, 2, and 3% with a three day steep\n\n**General Notes** - a balanced apricot / peach concentrate with subtle hints of a cooked or baked element. Some back end bright, tart, fresh fruit notes. Imagine a subdued version of FA Apricot with a touch of caramelized sugar.\n\nWhile FA is overpowering, super bright, and potent, FLV's addition to the Apricot realm is something significantly more versatile and forgiving. More of a sweetened and generalized stone fruit profile than a truly ripe apricot, but this is not a bad thing.\n\nNo rind, peel, or skin notes to be had here. The best comparison to be made is like taking the essence of a baked apricot. There is some hint of warmth in the profile, but overall, it's just a soft, caramelized apricot / peach.\n\n**Off Notes** - nothing, aside for the to-be-expected throatiness of an apricot concentrate. Thanks to the /u/ID10-T aka the DIY Science Bitch, I found out that the offender for that throat hit that rips me apart in peach and apricot concentrates is called linalool. So again, no real off notes in terms of flavour, but if you're sensitive to peach throat hit, this one will give you a little bit of irritation.\n\n**Percentage** - At 1.5%, there was not a whole lot of flavour going on, it was there in spirit, but the subtle nuances were next to nothing. 2% was what I found to be the sweet spot if we were trying to use this concentrate in a mix. Here, it's definitely got some potent flavour, while still providing those hints of bakery elements to add authenticity to a baked profile, or some interesting complexities to a purely fruit based recipe. 3% and above is where we would stay for a standalone vape. Everything is just amplified the higher it goes, and it never seems to really get offensive. I did not test higher than 5%, however, so keep that in mind if making a standalone vape with FLV Apricot.\n\n**Additional Observation** - while the king of these flavour reviews is obviously my boy /u/ConcreteRiver , I figured I'd try my hand at suggesting additional usage and pairing.\n\nWhile vaping this tester at the given percentages, I found 2 - 2.5% to be my favourite. Aside from the obvious profile of apricot with back end bakery elements, there were some interesting notes buried within this concentrate that may be beneficial for flavour bending.\n\nOn occasion, there is a slight hint of something tropical in this one, mostly on the exhale and aftertaste. This is most likely due to the nature of an apricot in general, being both sweet and tart at the same time. However, this hint of tropical fruit note will play well as an accent or an enhancer for that kind of profile.\n\nFurthermore, the slight baked notes in here (I mainly get brown sugar and some pie crust or crumble type note) will work really nicely in any sort of baked apricot, pie, or cupcake recipe. Going more the route I'm accustomed to, adding any sort of whiskey or bourbon concentrate here will work beautifully. This, in particular, will work better with alcohols and tobaccos than FA Apricot due to the subdued nature of FLV's version. Really, the applications are fairly versatile. Play around with profiles you like, see what works, and enjoy.\n\n**Overall Rating** - of this third round of flavours, this one was the one I was most excited for, and FLV did not disappoint. I like that we're getting a more versatile and slightly baked apricot here. Obviously, the throat hit sucks for me, but that's not going to be a detriment to the score, since that is a personal problem. I like this concentrate, and I'll be using it in future recipes, as well as in a revisit of my RootKit recipe (apricot tobacco).\n\nGreat job FLV, your attempt at an Apricot is getting a solid 4/5 from me.\n\nCheers.",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Flavorah Avocado, .25%, 1% and 3%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 14 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Underripe, slightly fruity avocado with a thicker base.\n\nThe avocado here is actually fairly prominent, especially at higher percentages.  It feels a bit artificially bright, and comes across as underripe.  A bit fruitier than a deeper, heavier ripe avocado flavor.   Light hints of something like a green banana, again like an underripe avocado.   I’d also peg it as something like green banana sweetness, not overwhelming, and almost a bit starchy as opposed to a fuller fruit or candy sweetness.  Nothing too earthy or funky here but a very light nuttiness. Most of that avocado is in working in the top notes, almost like a floral would.  The top notes specifically can get a bit dry, which is odd against the thicker base.\n\nRelatively thick, smooth body to this. Creamy without any discernible dairy notes.  Base tastes fairly neutral overall, although it does have just a bit of buttery fattiness.   The bulk of the actual avocado flavor mostly seems to sit on top of that heavier base.  Doesn’t quite cohere and really bleed into the thickness here. Tastes like an avocado top note on top of a thicker base, as opposed to a creamy avocado.  The inhale feels fairly cohesive, but the exhale has that avocado separating out and leaving the middle of the flavor feeling a bit light.  I wouldn’t think it would be a major issue in a mix where there are other flavors but it’s a bit odd solo.\n\nBelieve it or not, I haven’t had a ton of avocado flavors.  I feel like FE Avocado has a good deal of dulche de leche style caramel to it and just a tiny bit of vague green weirdness.  Sort of like an RY4 effect, but with green instead of tobacco.  I need to do a lot more testing with it, but from some very preliminary messing around,  Vape Train avocado seems to have a pretty prominent banana note which makes the whole experience kind of confusing.    This tastes a lot closer to an actual avocado to me without most of that banana or caramel baggage.  \n\n**Off-Flavors:**  Underripe and a bit fruity, but pretty low key.  Nothing too vegetal, funky, or swampy here.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light.  Fairly smooth but the top notes of the flavor can get a bit throaty.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At .25%, this feels a bit dry to me.  I’m getting a light avocado but that thicker base isn’t really coming through for me.  Avocado seems kind of one note here.\n\nAt 1%, this feels a bit more solid.  Avocado is maybe a bright, but the base seems fuller overall.  Doesn’t quite taste rich to me so much as kind of heavy. \n\nAt 3%, that avocado is getting pretty bright and maybe picking up some of that fruitier banana. Base seems richer though, and I’m actually getting a bit of fat to it.  I mean, for 3% of a FLV Avocado flavor, the lack of grievous off-notes is pretty cool.\n\nJust based on these tests, this has a relatively wide workable range.  I mean, you could go safe and use this around .5% for an avocado accent in something… but that seems safe.  I’d probably be mixing closer to 2%.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Uhhhhhhh…… maybe throw it an ice cream?   Some additional cream and richness is going to smooth out that top note a bit more and should be be pretty good?  Just use TPA VBIC and you could have a black pepper and avocado ice cream, which is a thing exists.  If you wanted to really blow out the heavier parts of the base, add some FLV Coconut.\n\nWith said, that I think the green part of this isn’t going to magically disappear in mixes, and will still stick out so it might not be some silver bullet for adding thickness if you don’t want the mix to kind of taste like avocado… but I’ve had run-ins with vegan avocado frosting so you may not have my own personal scars related to tasting avocado where it shouldn’t be. \n\nNot crazy savory, but I can’t think of a fruit that would really pair well except for lime but I really like guacamole.  \n\nOr hey, when it doubt, claim it could be used in a tobacco.  Would probably work well to add some thickness to a tobacco without making the entire thing seem wet and would play well with the savory notes there.  \n\n**Second Opinions:**  [There is an ELR Page up for this.  Rin writes: “tastes the way avocado smells... hard to describe... not a very in your face flavor but has a unique mouth-feel... a lot of body. would probably be great to add to creams/ etc to add that texture/extra body. Will report back after I've tried that. \nPreferred single flavor mix: 0.5%”](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/234674)\n\n[User “gatchay” has an Avacado Coconut Ice Cream recipe up on ATF.  From their notes: “FLV avocado isn't exactly a realistic avocado, but they did a very good job capturing that fatty thickness you get from an avocado. The reality is an avocado isn't packed with a ton of flavor to begin with. You get more of the actual taste as it lingers rather than when you vape it, but none the less this is the closest to avocado out of the others I've tried. This flavoring is actually fairly strong and can be used lower depending what you're doing, I liked it most in this at 0.75% to stand up to the creams. It needed to separate itself rather than just thicken things up, which you can also use this for lower at around 0.25%. “](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/92823#avocado_coconut_ice_cream_by_gachatay)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Creamy coconut like FA Coconut would help up the creaminess here. It should work with  FLV Cream or FA Fresh Cream in that milkshake application. Guanabana/Soursop/Cherimoya would be great here, accentuating the creamy banana notes in those concentrates. Bright fruit like strawberries or pineapple.  CAP Graham, TFA Graham Cracker Clear, or TFA Cheesecake Graham Crust would be great for the malty notes.  Seems like a good banana for mixing with chocolates.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nI've only got two other bananas for comparison.  It's less harsh candy then LA Banana Cream, and creamier than TFA Banana Ripe.  As /u/botboy141/ stated, actual banana flavor here is similar but the overall vape is creamier and smoother.\n\nI'm thinking percentage used is going to vary with your sensitivity to banana flavors.  Recognizable but faint at .5%.  I like this quite a bit at 1.5-2%.  You get most of the creamy banana without pushing too far in that candy banana.  Higher than 3% and you're going to go straight banana candy, if that's your thing.  That candy banana gets plastic pretty fast, so I'd avoid this as a primary note.  You're going to get deep into off-flavors before you saturate the flavor enough to get a super strong candy banana taste.\n\nOverall, seems like a good banana for creamy mixes under 2%.\n\nShoutout to /u/apexified for sending this my way for review.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Deleted user's quick take on flavor, finds a lot more realism here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/328tua/my_flv_tasting_notes_banana/)\n\n[/u/botboy141/ finds it comparable to TFA Ripe Banana.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/2zunm4/flavorah_flv_flavor_reviews_by_ubotboy141/)\n\n[Some good notes on ELR](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/33047)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Hint of vanilla somewhere in there.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  At 45w tastes a lot like fennel.  Upping the power starts to push into a a swampy vegetal taste underneath a clear, bright basil flavor.\n\n**Throat Hit**6/10.  Fairly harsh on an RDA especially at lower wattages.

Primary competition here would be FA Zen Garden, and I think this wins hands down.  Zen Garden has always tasted like dried basil flakes, whereas this is a much brighter and fresh tasting flavor.  It does struggle with some of the same off flavors at higher wattages.  I was hoping for a nice clean thai basil type of flavor, and it falls short of that mark.  Much more of a sweet basil flavor with some vegetal murkiness.  A mix with any kind of jammy or fermented flavor is going to do some really weird things to this concentrate.",

Crispier, grainier roasted peanuts and a smoother almost raw creamy almond at the back. Does a pretty convincing job of tasting salty. Some weird iodine burn like you get from iodized table salt.\n\nInhale is sharp and nutty, with a stinging salty note. Dense with a roasted kind of sweetness. I get a honey roasted peanut at the front of the exhale, and a smoother creamier almond or cashew towards the back.  Still tastes fairly salty, although the inhale is a lot sharper and saltier than the exhale. Peanuts up front are moderately sweet and have a grittier texture.  Almond at the back has a denser body, without as much grit. Sweetness also tails off.  Lingering rawness in the mouth from that sharper salt flavor with an iodine burn.\n\n**Off Flavors:**  While this legit tastes salty I get a hint of some of that weird iodine note that FLV Peanut Butter. It's not as jasrring here as it is in Peanut Butter, but that could just be that this flavor seems to have a bit more going on.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Solo, this flavor has a bit of sting to it. You notice it pretty clearly on the inhale in the back of the throat and it tends to stick around your mouth through the entire vape. There's some more traditional throat hit, but that mouth rawness and sting is a little odd. I'm thinking it's tied to whatever flavorah is using to pull off salt.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Crisp and gritty enough to stand in for Acetyl Pyrazine without some of the weird fritos off-notes that come with AP.  Useful for adding texture and salt to a bakery. A lot of bakery flavors taste a little flat, like real baked goods do without salt.  This gives you the option of adding both texture and seasoning in one shot. AP is useful for making your chocolates come together, and this also brings in some some nuttiness to pair with the chocolate.\n\nFlavorah suggests this for mixing with tobaccos.  I think non-aromatic tobaccos are going to be your best bet, but I don't really \"get\" aromatic tobaccos, so YMMV.\n\n**Notes:**  This stuff is strong.  I'd stick to using this under at .5% and under.  At .25% you get strong but indistinct nuttiness with some pretty solid salt. At .5% The almond softer nut notes start to separate from that peanut up front.  At .75%, that saltiness is getting overwhelming.  !% is just about the useful ceiling here.  Decently nutty, crisp, and with a good body but that salt note is really sharp and heavy on that aforementioned Iodine edge.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nThere's not a whole lot out there right now...\n\n[Here's the product page from Flavorah.

Flavorah describes it as a \" juicy berry punch\" and their product picture has some raspberry, blueberry, and what looks like a blackberry. Seems pretty close. Good amount of realistic berry tartness and manages to avoid tasting too medicinal or like a generic mixed berry candy flavor.\n\nInhale is sweet, dense, and a bit warm. Some good raspberry tartness there. Exhale has brighter raspberry up front with a pretty light floral character. Thicker, darker berry base.  Sweet, jammy, and dense. Mouthfeel is a bit sticky.  Tart, slightly green blueberry on the tail end of the exhale.  Fairly clean, just a lingering sweetness.\n\n**Off Flavors:** Not really.  Nothing too sharp, green, or just plain off here. Pretty good balance overall. A little warm and \"red\" but doesn't have that pronounced medicinal, woody, camphor kind of note like TFA Berry Mix.  Pretty solidly on the jammy, as opposed to fresh, side of things.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Light. Nothing weird but you can feel it's there.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  It's actually a pretty good jammy berry mix.  I'd use it as a jammy bakery filling. Has a lot of the sweetness, jamminess, and a bit of the warmth needed for fillings in pies, cobblers, donuts, etc...\n\nA little indistinct and sweet for use as a primary note in a fruit mix. Would work well to bring in background sweetness and volume in a mix with a more dominant berry up front.\n\nA bit sticky and sweet for cream blends.  That jamminess and sticky mouthfeel is pronounced enough it may mess with the mouthfeel of more delicate creams.  Might work for something like a berry swirl in a heavier ice cream flavor, where you'd still want some of that mouthfeel.\n\n**Notes:**  S&V concentration testing, this doesn't seem to be one of the crazy strong Flavorah flavors. A bit too thin and weak at .25 and .5%.  Good sweetness, but the berry flavor is kind of muddy and soft.  Fairly full flavor at 1%, really starting to get that jammy mouthfeel.  2% is pretty good, fruit is brighter and sweeter but it's getting a slightly candy edge to it. 3% is getting a bit sharp and I'm getting more florals off the berries. 4% seems like the useful ceiling here.  A bit too floral for me up there, with a really intense sweetness.  I'd recommend starting at 1% and working up for anything but a bakery filling.  For those jammy fillings, you'd probably be safe starting at 2% and working up.\n\nPutting this in context of the couple of other berry mixes I've tried, this seems to have a pretty unique place.  TFA Berry Mix (and based on the descriptions I've read CAP Harvest Berry) lean pretty heavily toward red, medicinal, and woody.  FA Forest mix is a slightly darker flavor, with a lot more realistic and fresh edge.  This tastes a bit more cooked and sweetened than either.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nAlmost nothing I can find.\n\n[Here's the Flavorah product page. Description is: \"Juicy berry punch, in high concentrations it goes towards berry jam. Can be stand alone, but benefits from mixing with other notes in our opinion.\"](http://store.flavorah.com/concentrated-berry-blend-flavor)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Berry Cheesecake @ 1% and 1 drop per 10 ml (about .25%), 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 11 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Sweet cheesecake filling with some tarter, floral berries and just a trace of crust towards the end.  Filling is pretty dominant here, without having a ton of nuance. Berry flavor has some realistic tartness but takes a back seat to the cheesecake filling. Also has a floral edge that doesn't quite blend with the sweeter, fluffier cheesecake filling. Lacking in the crust department.  Not quite satisfying enough for a single flavor, but seems to be a pretty good base to build off of or use for a tart berry cheesecake flavor with something else going on.\n\nInhale is dense and berry forward. Tarter, dark berries somewhere between a tarter blackberry and and a sweeter blueberry. Not a lot of cheesecake on the inhale, more just a sweet fluffy density. Exhale is definitely cheesecake filling forward. On the sweeter side, almost a cream cheese frosting without a lot of cheesy richness. The berries on the exhale are still fairly tart, with pronounced floral top notes. Just a hint of a grainier crust on the tail end of the exhale more in the mouthfeel than an actual taste. Overall, dense and on the sweeter side, although the tartness and the sharpness of the florals keeps it from getting too one note. Fairly clean finish, although the vapor has a pretty strong cheesecake smell so that complicates things a bit.\n\n**Off Flavors:**  Berry component is a bit floral.  The cheesecake here gets weird and artificial over 2%.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Nah, not really.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  These complex flavors that aren't quite a one-shot are a bit hard to mix with.  They seem to act best as a \"bridge\" type of flavor to hang other concentrates from to fill out the intended profile of the initial concentrate.  If you want a more complete Berry Cheesecake it's going to take some reinforcements.   Here, I'd lean toward adding another cheesecake, like TFA Cheesecake (Graham Crust), to really fill out the cream and give a more solid base for the crust.  I'd also go for something a little grainier with some AP (like your favorite graham cracker, cookie, or like flavorah suggests FLV Biscotti) to get a heavier, grainy crust.  And the berries here need some help from a sweeter, jammier berry like FLV Boysenberry or even FLV Berry Mix.  I think the best thing this concentrate will be doing in a mix like that is helping to join everything together and give a cohesive, smooth mix.\n\nAs a discrete flavor, this probably has enough going on to add a \"berry cheesecake\" component to a mix like an ice cream or milkshake.\n\n**Notes:**  S&V Concentration, .25% and .5% are on the weak side. Hard to pick out the actual components of the flavor. 1% is pretty solid, with the tartness of the berries starting to show up and the cheesecake filling tasting like a separate component. At 1.5%, separation is a bit better and the sweetness level is a bit more intense.  At 2%, the berries are seeming a bit too floral. At 3% the cheesecake isn't really getting cheesy so much as tasting a little to artificial and getting just a hint of that weird playdough note.  I'd recommend starting with this at 1% for a bridge flavor to build a cheesecake around.  If you're more interested in using this a discrete berry cheesecake component I'd start at 1.5% and work up.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Here's the product page from Flavorah.  Their description: \"Ripe berries with tart creamy cake. More of the white cheesecake than the cookie crust or berry. Recommend Biscotti and any berry to mix in.\"](http://store.flavorah.com/concentrated-berry-cheesecake-flavor)\n\n[One 4-star review on BCF by user \"Foggz\": \"Solid Berry front flavor @2% and 2Days.

Touch of caramel and cinnamon. Could be a holiday cookie because it makes you feel really cozy and relaxed.\n\n**Disclaimer**: I've never eaten a Biscotti before so I am going into this with no idea if this is accurate to the flavor or not I'm just going based on the following google description:\n> \n> Biscotti, known also as cantuccini, are Italian almond biscuits that originated in the city of Prato. They are twice-baked, oblong-shaped, dry, crunchy and dipped in a drink, traditionally Vin Santo.\n\n**Flavor description**: This tastes pretty faithful to how a biscotti is described. \nYou get a incredibly dry tasting biscuit with some almond notes in the exhale. This flavor is also pretty complex. The dryness isn't one dimensional and incredibly accurate to a very dry cookie/biscuit flavor. Other cookie/biscuit flavors have a single flavor cookie/biscuit they appease to. This you can practically taste the the \"twice baked\" flavor. It, initially, has a baked flavor on the inhale and on the exhale you can taste a slight burnt biscuit flavor. This doesn't seem to have any bitter notes you would expect it might have. This has, to me, the most accurate representation of a almond flavor that I've tried yet. Not a raw almond flavor but a baked almond flavor. \n\n**First Impressions**: This stuff is strong as hell. Using this over 1% is a guaranteed bottle down the drain. At least in my experience, it will over take any other flavors you mixed with it. The background flavors changed based on how much you use. .25%-.75% this flavor has pretty different characteristics. On the lower end of things you get a very mellow version of a biscotti with almost no almond notes. .75% you get the full package. The higher you go the drier it gets. This flavor doesn't seem to get really wonky the higher you use it just the same flavor you normally get but really gets very unvapeable. 1.5% this stuff is damn intense to vape. All of the flavors hit you all at once with a vengeance. There are recipes on ATF that have this at 3% and I personally think that is way too high considering how bad this overtakes an entire mix easily.\n\n**Throat hit**: Nothing of note/ surprisingly incredibly smooth\n\n**Off-flavors**: I'm having a hard time describing what flavor I'm getting. Flavorah says this has caramel and cinnamon but I'm not getting any cinnamon and a slight burnt caramel flavor from this. Tastes almost boozy. Inline with a rum or bourbon. It's not off putting by any means but worth mentioning.\n\nThis flavor will linger on your wicks for what seems like hours. I have a habit of changing flavors throughout the day and I can always taste this in the background after I quit vaping it hours earlier.\n\n**Uses**: If you wish to have a drier flavor with some nutty,baked complexities in the background this will be a good go to. I recommend this flavor from .25%-.75%. I've used it up to 1.5% and it's all you can taste in the mix. No matter what I threw at it. I didn't notice the flavor calms down very much after a steep either. At least doesn't let anything else through if you use this too high. \n\n**Second Opinions**: \n\n[From ELR Notes](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/120766):\n\n> \tI've been working with Biscotti (FLV) and I'm pretty impressed with it so far. My 1st mix with it was at 1.5% and it was STRONG. My recent mixes I've lowered to .7% and I'm getting a much better cookie flavor from it. It reminds me of those flower shaped butter cookies with hole in the center. It imparts a buttery, vanilla and a slight lemon note. It definitely delivers a crunch type effect also. My test are still early, but this flavor shows potential. My feeling is that this flavor can affect a mix below .7%.\n\n[From Flavorah's website](http://store.flavorah.com/concentrated-biscotti-flavor)\n\n> At first mix it was strong but after a few days it mellowed into a delicious vape. Hints of almond.\n\nEDIT:\n\n**10 Day Steep Update**: This flavor is relatively the same across the board. There is about a 10-15% drop in the intensity in regards how potent this was first mixed. But the flavor overall hasn't changed much beyond calming down just a tad bit.",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Black Cherry @ 1% and 1 drop per 10ml (about .25%), 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 14 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Eh, maybe there is something here that I'm not getting or I got a bad batch of this? I don't really get whats going on here. I get a really light, dry cherry flavor and a whole bunch of slightly chemical, dry marshmallow body.  I'm inclined to say this is fairly polarizing because some people seem to dig this, and other people say this is super light and weird.  Kind of like INW Cherries, but a darker cherry flavor and substantially heavier on the weird dryness.\n\nInhale is strange. Light body with a pretty overwhelming chemical taste. Slightly bitter and a little sour. Exhale has some good dark cherry flavor in the top notes, but most of the body here is that strange dry chemical taste. Has a bit of marshmallow flavor if not texture or sweetness.  Still thin, and noticeably harsh. Again, I'm a bit mystified.\n\n**Off Flavors:**  Oh pretty much the entire thing.  Dry, chemical body with a light marshmallow kind of flavor makes up the bulk of this concentrate for me.  It doesn't taste like gasoline or plastic though, so that's something?\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Yeah, this is pretty harsh even at .25%. \n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Based on my testing, nothing I'd be comfortable suggesting. Too off to really use what little dark cherry flavor I get here.  Flavorah suggest tobaccos and dark chocolate, and I can kind of see it.  The relative dryer, thinner cherry flavor isn't going to get all juicy and moisten those kind of mixes but INW Cherries operates largely the same way, and to me at least, seems a whole hell of a lot less bizarre.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, I'm not finding a percentage here that works for me. For a lot of Flavorah flavors, the trick is to use them low, but that doesn't seem to be the case here. I don't much cherry flavor either at .25 or 1%. I will say I get most of the actual cherry down low at .25%, it doesn't seem the like the cherry scales with the percentage.  Upping the percentage just seems to add more of that weird dry marshmallow thing. S&V testing, this doesn't seem to improve with higher percentages. I tried 2, 3, and 4% and it just gets more \"off\" and weird.\n\nJust crossing off the usual culprits, I've tried another rda and I get the same results. I can also still taste other flavors, so I'm pretty sure this isn't a blanket vaper's tongue situation.\n\nI'd be really interested to hear other people's experience with this, because based on my experience, I don't really see how this is a thing.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Here's the product page from Flavorah.  Their description: \"Familiar cherry notes mix well with other flavors or stand alone. Good for use in cherry tobacco recipes. This is not the medicinal black cherry flavor of cough suppressant. This black cherry is like the cherry sauce in an ice cream Sunday or the black cherry in dark chocolate.

    "markdown": "**Summary:** \n\nIf you’re not familiar with the black currant, think of it as cranberry’s sweeter, more attractive culinary cousin (no botanical relation.) Picture a small berry with the sweetness and tartness of a grape, having a unique characteristic flavor similar to cooked cranberries but deeper and fuller.\n\nFlavorah did an outstanding job of imitating this fruit’s unique flavor. Use at 1.5% for fresh, ripe berries; 3.0-3.5% for a cooked berry flavor.\n\n**Setup:** Inde Duo with SS clapton coils, TC set at 435 F, power capped at 80W.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Black Currant, 0.5% - 4.0%, 70/30 VG/PG, tasted at 1, 3, 7  and 14 days steep.\n\n**Off-flavors:** none up to 3.5%\n\n**Throat Hit:** none\n\n**Percentage testing:**\n\n* At 0.5%, it's very faint. Nothing to see here, move along.\n\n* At 1.0%, there’s a recognizable berry  flavor. Kinda like fruit punch with 10% juice. Too faint to make out much detail\n\n* At 1.5% it’s unmistakably black currant, albeit lacking the tartness of the actual fruit. The unique musky flavor found in ripe black currants is center stage.\n\n* At 2.0%, it gets a tad jammy. All the same flavors are still present, but now give the impression of cooked berries.\n\n* At 2.5%, as before, but more so. Not quite jam, more like cooked-down berry puree with little (if any) added sweetness. Also developing a pleasantly thick mouthfeel at this level.\n\n* At 3.0%, sweeter, and starting to lose some of the nuances. Incredibly thick mouthfeel. This is black currant jelly, spot-on.\n\n* At 3.5%, it’s definitely black currant jam now. Very full flavor, syrupy mouthfeel. I so want to pair this with some ripe cheese right now!\n\n* At 4.0%, the musky notes get oversaturated and turn funky. Not entirely unpleasant, but not at all fruity anymore. Earthy and fermented, overripe.\n\n* Effect of steeping beyond 1 day was not noticeable at 1.5% and below. At higher concentrations, the cooked notes grew stronger while the fruitiness waned a bit with additional steeping.\n\n**Suggested uses/pairings:**\n\nAt 3-3.5%: pie crust, heavy dairy, cheesecakes, cheeses. At lower levels, it should fit in anywhere its paler, tarter culinary cousins—the cranberry and the lingonberry—do.",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Flavorah Black Tea, .25%, 1% and 3%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 10 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  A  black tea with something jasmine-ish and floral.\n\nFor a black tea, this is a relatively mellow flavor overall.  Tastes fairly accurate, but doesn’t seem like chopping lines of pekoe like some other tea flavors.  Some very light earthiness separating this from something like a green tea, but no real hint of that really intense, almost bordering on dirt flavor  I get with something like TPA Black Tea.  Some astringency to remind you it’s a tea, but, again, pretty subtle without that heavy tannic oversteeped black tea thing.\n\nLight indistinct citrus here.  Could easily be a bit of lemon rind.  It seems like more of a component of the tea flavor instead of being “lemon tea.”   Light tartness folds itself into that tea astringency fairly delicately. I am also getting something floral here.  Tastes a lot like Jasmine, which is a bit odd for a black tea flavor, I’d expect that in a green tea.  It’s fairly prominent, but it does taste like steeped jasmine in a tea rather than just jasmine perfume.  Picks up some green, leafy notes at higher percentages.\n\nTastes like a sweetened tea.  It’s not blindingly sweet like  delicious regional diabeetus “Sweet Tea” but there is definitely something sweeter than just straight black tea. Less sweet than Snapple but moving in that direction.  Vapes like a tea, relatively thin and fairly warm.\n\nI know that FA Black Tea goes south relatively quickly after bottling so my only comparison test here is with a well aged bottle, so YMMV.  Compared to the FA, the FLV version seems more floral and less earthy.  The FA version has a more aggressive astringency to it, while the FLV just feels a bit softer overall.  Sweetness level seems fairly similar.  Also, TPA Black Tea tastes like dirt and the FLV doesn’t.\n\n**Off-Flavors:** Some kind of floral, tastes a lot like steeped jasmine.  A bit jarring in a black tea, but not unpleasant.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Moderate.  Seems a bit throaty solo.\n\n**Percentage testing:** At .25% I’m mostly getting dry black tea leaves.  Dark and a bit astringent.  The leaves are coming through fairly clearly, but I’m missing the body, sweetness, and overall beverage type feel.\n\nAt 1%, this is starting to feel more like a beverage than just dry tea leaves.  Warmer, sweeter, fuller, and less dry overall.  That jasmine-esque floral is starting to creep in for me though.\n\nAt 3%, that floral thing is fairly prominent and I’m getting a green leafy thing. That actual tea here seems a bit less aggressive with everything else going on here.\n\nJust based on these tests, seems to have at least some workable range.  Flavor is present down low and would fine as a black tea accent at .5% and below.  For a fuller tea with a greener accent for a base or solo flavor, I’d be around 2%.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  At lower percentages, pretty standard black tea flavor.  Feels a bit dry for me that low, but could pair up well with juicier fruit flavors like mangoes, strawberries, and peaches. \n\nYou could also be a tea purist and just add some cream or something and call it a day.  Should pair well with some extra citrus if you drop in some EM or something to knock off the throatier edges.\n\nOr add some more jasmine and play with that floral thing going on.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  [I dug this more mixed higher, but maybe I’m just a barbarian and you should use this low.  Just gauging time lines, it looks like these may have shorter steeps too, and trying this S&V it does seem to a bit more aggressive.  3 notes up on ELR so far.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/234671)\n\nUser “Silhouette” writes: “Notes of Rose Hip, Dark and Robust Black Tea flavor. The Rose Hip flavor is unmistakable, although very delicate. It is lighter than say, an Irish Breakfast Tea, which can have slightly bitter notes and an 'in your face' flavor, it's actually more like a well brewed cup of Black Tea. No bitter notes, and the Black Tea flavor is actually there, prominent and sweet. So far it is lovely, and potent. Testing at 0.5/1%.

Not realistic enough for actual fruit mixes as a solo blueberry.  I'd call it a cooked sweetened blueberry filling for bakeries, especially if you want to duplicate something mass-market as opposed to homemade. Candy blueberry.\n\n**Pairings:**  Low percentage of FA Bilberry for some more realistic blueberry notes. Soft enough flavor to mix well with creams and custards. Low percentage of Lemon Sicily or sweet citrus to punch up the flavor. Candy texturizers like CAP Jelly Candy or FW Hard Candy. Other sweeter berries like Raspberry or Strawberry if you want a full \"mixed berry\" flavor.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nI'm finding this a little weak for flavorah. 3% seems like the minimum you'd want to mix to get any kind of definition from this.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Blueberry Muffin @ %1 and 3%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 13 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  More of a baked in blueberry flavor than a full blueberry muffin. Sweet, but not too overtly candy, blueberry right up front with a little bit of a darker, cooked, bakery volume without a lot of actual grain to it.  A bit weak for a flavorah bakery, seems to come into it's own at 3%.\n\nInhale is moderately dense, with a tart blueberry flavor.  Not a ton of sweetness there. Blueberry on the exhale is less tart but a lot sweeter. Not a lot of higher, floral top notes but a solid tart blueberry up there. Blueberry tastes cooked but not turned into jam. More like the vaguely purple parts of a muffin where the blueberry has leeched into the muffin. No real \"muffin\" taste here, but I'm definitely getting a hint of that kind of volume and dryness. Muffin mouthfeel if not the actual taste.  Fairly dense for being so blueberry forward.  Lingering blueberry top notes.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Not a whole lot of muffin here, so maybe that?\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light. Nothing crazy, but you know it's there.  At higher percentages, that blueberry has a bit of an edge to it.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This seems like one of those Flavorah flavors where you'll have to bring your own AP. That makes it a bit more useful. Your use is going to depend on what kind of base you want to bring in. Something like CAP Vanilla Cupcake for a sweeter blueberry muffin.  Maybe a bit of cookie if you want a denser, more cooked muffin.  Good blueberry note for waffles or pancakes.\n\nThe blueberry here doesn't need much help, but if you want to really hammer it home a syrupy blueberry like FLV Blueberry or something like FW Huckleberry will help add a lower end to the blueberry and moisten up the mix a bit.\n\nBecause the muffin is fairly light here, you could get away with using this in a straighter fruit mix for a sweet blueberry flavor, with some added bakery-like volume without actually tasting much muffin.\n\n**Notes:**  S&V concentration testing, this is pretty much just a bright, thin blueberry at 1% and under.  2% has quite a bit more body and that blueberry actually seems a bit less bright because of the volume. 3% is good, the blueberry flavor is full and that bakery volume complements it really well. 4% has a tarter edge to the blueberry, without any more of that bakery back-end.  5% seems to be losing some of the appeal, as that blueberry is getting a bit tart and picking up a bit of a boozy edge.  I'd recommend starting with this at 2% if you want a slightly more subtle blueberry, or 3% if you want the blueberry up front.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nFairly well documented, actually.\n\n[Here are the infamous deleted user's quick tasting notes: \"Sweet, cooked blueberry. Subtle overall flavor. Has deeper notes but no punch. Clean/no off flavors. Don’t really get muffin notes at all.  Try using to round out berry flavors and add bottom ripeness. Very subtle vape on its own. Oddly this flavor stimulates mild salivation.

The star of the show is that bold smoky, charred oak flavor on the inhale and the beginning of the exhale.  Exhale ends with a relatively thin but suprisingly accurate sweet blended whiskey note.\n\n**Off-flavors:** None.\n\n**Throat Hit:** 7/10, but that's kind of the point, right? An assertive charred oak taste is going to be a bit aggressive.\n\n**Uses:**  A strong initial bourbon note, which carries really well into mixes.  It manages to stay prominent and identifiable even with competing concentrates thrown into a mix.  Great for cocktails and tobacco mixes.  It's probably not great for bakeries where you'd add something like TFA Kentucky Bourbon for warmth.\n\n**Pairings:**  Dark or jammy fruit like apples or blueberries, dark chocolate, citrus, tobacco, vanilla, butterscotch, caramel. \n\n**Notes:**  This is fantastic.  If TFA Kentucky Bourbon is the melted ice from a 7&7, and FA Whisky is that actual 7&7, then this is worlds ahead in evoking actual whiskey.  That rich and robust charred oak sits right up in front, and holds on after a steep.  The actual body of the whiskey is thin and sweet, but I'll be using this primarily for that opening note.

Balanced tartness and a heavy, juicy mouthfeel.  A bit hard to place the actual berry flavor, but I don't get any medicinal red berry type of notes until around 4%.  A bit of harshness, but a sweeter take on a clear and fairly clean dark berry flavor.\n\nSharp and sweet tart berry inhale.  Not as deep as a blackberry, but without any of those camphor-y notes you get from red berries. A little warm and moderately dense with a bit of harshness. Candy blueberry / blackberry right up front on the exhale. Intensely sweet and still a bit tart. Mild blackberry floral top notes.  Prominent candy sweetness on the back end with some juiciness, bordering on a a sticky syrupy mouthfeel. Lingering sugar lips with tart and floral berry notes.\n  \n**Off-flavors:** Not really though it definitely leans towards candy with the level of sweetness here.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light, although it pushes more toward moderate as you push higher towards 3%.  The pretty intense sweetness here gets a bit rough.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  At lower percentages, has a bit of tartness and brightness that will add a bit of body to a more floral berry like raspberry or blackberry or some brightness to a really deep, syrupy berry flavor like FLV Blueberry.  At higher percentages, it's a good base for jammier berry flavors. I still want just a little bit more depth to really sell a berry filling though, so maybe add some Liquid Amber.\n\nPretty much perfect for berry candies.  Good fit in heavier creams and custards. Tastes a bit like the blackberry syrup they'll blend into milkshakes.  Should pair well with citruses for a dark berry lemonade kind of vibe.\n\n**Notes:**  S&V concentration testing, this is pretty forgiving. Even as low as .25%, there's a relatively bright, tart berry flavor with a solid sweetness. .5% is just a bit sweeter and fuller. 1% has a bit of syrupy, candy mouthfeel and the sweetness feels a bit more round. At 2%, the tartness of the berry is dying down a bit, and you're getting a blueberry hard candy type of taste.  At 3%, the berry is a little flatter, and the mouthfeel is getting a bit jammy. 4% is pretty intense, seems to be getting a bit too sweet and that berry is getting a bit medicinal.  5% is sweet, harsh, and sticky with a berry flavor that's creeping towards robitutssin.  For a brighter berry accent, I'd start at .5% and work up. For a fuller main note I'd start at 2% and work up.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[/u/Growing_plants had a religious experience: \"This stuff is amazing, I have been throwing it in everything from PB & J sandwich flavor to a nice jammy pastry and even cereal flavors (so far best berry addition I have used in any recipe).

Some light aged cheese rind flavor.  Maybe a bit of smooth slightly sour cream.  The smell of the lingering cloud is definitely cheesy, but I'm not getting much from the actual vape.  Maybe a hint of mustiness.\n\n**Off-flavors:** You're vaping brie.  So none that you wouldn't expect.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  0/10.  None that I can find.\n\n**Uses:**  Sour cream frosting if you add sweetness.  Your own vapable cheese plate.  I can't believe I'm typing this, but adding some yogurt if you want a funkier cheese flavor.\n\n**Pairings:**  Green Apples, Bright pears, Plums, Figs, Grapes, drier bakery bases like FA Cookie and INW Biscuit. \n\n**Notes:** I was expecting calamity.  Sheer terror, now in vape form. I didn't get that. I actually don't get a strong flavor at all. I've vaped through my entire 20ml tester and I'm digging this.  I even went back and just tried the back of the hand test with the concentrate thinking I had fucked up my tester labeling and I'm still not getting the pungent notes I was expecting.  I even switched to my testing base for a 3% mix that I had sitting around and confirmed that there definitely is a concentrate in there.  Moving up to 80w/500F and I'm still not getting anything offensive. Hell, just tried a shake n' vape at 3% and the same kind of vibe, but a sort of a chemical mess.  Switched atomizers to a Troll with a single stapled fused clapton and It's not giving me rancid or particulary cheesy, both with the aged sample and a 5ml S&V at starting at 1 drop and moving up.\n\nI've tried clearing my palette a half dozen ways with fresh wicks and It just doesn't strike me as particularly assertive or weird.  Maybe this a function of the steep, but this is downright pleasant, as I'm not a huge fan of yogurt vapes, and I was expecting that assertive almost rancid vibe you get from FA Yogurt.\n\nI have three possible theories:\n\n1)My taste buds are completely shot or I can't taste something in this flavor.\n\n2)I got a bad batch of concentrate, although I ordered directly from Flavorah and not a re-bottler.\n\n3)This is actually pretty subtle, and kind of good.\n\nI'll leave it to second opinions to figure out which one of these is right.\n\nI'm 100% ready to admit that I'm wrong here, but I ain't mad at it.  I would wait for a some second opinions before ordering this, because I'm mystified.\n\n[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)\n\nEDIT: I came back to this one.  I was thinking my taste buds were at least partially shot, and I was right.  A day later, after literally sucking on lemons for a while, this is stronger than I initially though.  The flavor isn't as subtle as I initially tasted.  The cheese rind flavor is definitely there.  Here is the thing though, I don't find it rancid at all, which was my big concern.  I'm still a fan, but yeah, the parmesan is there.  What isn't there is that butryic acid clusterfuck that you get in some yogurts and DX flavors.  So, less subtle, but it's a pretty decent slightly aged creamy cheese flavor.  I don't think it would change my use of the flavor substantially.  I'd like to apologize for being relatively hasty on this.",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Brulee, .25, 1, and 3%, others noted, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 8 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  A lot of brulee, less creme.  Seems to have a fluffier mouthfeel, missing some of the crunch from the brulee and the richness of the custard underneath.\n\nThe brulee note here is interesting. It isn't exactly the harder crunchier caramelized sugar I'd expect. It's a little softer and it has a bit of a cereal type body to it, which is really interesting but maybe not a fit for the brulee.  That cereal feels just a bit cardboardy.  Almost like someone put some FW Rice Krispies (or whatever they've changed the name to now) in here.  There are some caramelized sugar notes in here, but it's not as hard and solid as straight FLV Caramel.  Caramel is somewhere around medium dark instead of burnt, which would be nice, but the texture kind of detracts from the brulee feeling.\n\nThere's also an errant tart note at the beginning of the vape that seems to be lightening the punch of something that should be a heavy, solid flavor.\n\nThere is some kind of cream or custard in here, but it doesn't feel all that rich. That same softer cereal texture is kind of screwing with the texture of the custard base. I think get just a hint of an eggy taste, but I'm missing most of the creamy richness I'd expect.  There's also a really light vanilla, but it's not up front or really defining of the concentrate.\n\nMouthfeel overall runs towards fluffy, which doesn't really suit the creme or the brulee.  There's a lot volume, but it could stand to be a lot denser.\n\nSweetness level is pretty solid, sugary but not cloying.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Nothing here tastes bad, but it's a sort of odd combination.  The brulee itself is a bit soft, there's a really light custard note without much egg, and I think I'm getting a bit of cereal type body out of it.  I also get a tartness on the caramel note that isn't really a fit for the profile.  Can get cardboardy from that cereal note, and the tartness and the caramel together can get a bit soapy at high percentages.  Not FA Caramel soapy, but hey, it seems like it's in the background at 3%.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light to Moderate. Those caramelized notes are a bit hard on the throat.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At .25% solo, I'm actually getting a decent amount of caramel out of this. Still suffering from that fluffy mouthfeel thing.  No real custard. Too weak down here.\n\nAt 1% solo, this is a little denser, but not by much. Fluffy caramelized sugar note. Cereal grain is coming through a bit clearer. Just a bit of custard coming in around the edges, but I want something a lot richer.\n\nAt 3% solo, that tartness up front is really showing up and the caramel note is getting a little soapy.  That cereal volume is also pushing a little cardboardy. Richness in the custard hasn't really shown up and it's still a lighter accent.\n\nJust for laughs, I tried this with some INW Custard. At .5% Brulee and 1.5% INW Custard, it definitely fills in the custard part of this fairly well.  The extra creamyness also helps to suck up a bit of that tartness.  Texture doesn't really click for me on the brulee though, still feeling a bit too fluffy and while it does taste like creme brulee, it just doesn't come together all that well.\n\nHoping that this could work as a caramel enhancer, I also tried this at 1% with 2% INW Pink Lady (which has a kind of caramel apple vibe to it.)  It's okay, but that textural component isn't quite meshing and that flat cereal note is sticking out quite a bit.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  The taste here is okay, but the texture is going to be an issue.  I'd try this as a texturizer for harder caramels, but you'd probably have to come in with quite a bit of something like FLV Cream to sort of emulsify everything together and try to fill in that blank spot from the cereal body.\n\nI do think this would work pretty well to add some caramel and a heavier roasted note to cereals, but that may be a specialized use case.\n\nYou may also be able to use this kind of toast a marshmallow without going straight to TPA Toasted Marshmallow. Fluffier texture would be a fit there, and there isn't enough richness to pull the mix away from a marshmallow.\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Pleasantly boring, actually.\n\nInhale is dense and dry, with some sharper pink bubble gum flavor.  Flavor opens up a bit on the exhale.

Just a tiny bitter edge to the top notes, accurate to pink bubble gum. Mouthfeel is dry and dense, bordering on chalky.  Not crazy sweet, but has an authentic level of candy sweetness in here.

Fairly harsh as a S&V, but seems to calm down fairly quickly.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Bubble Gum, mostly. Flavorah suggests mixing with top heavy flavors, and I'd have to aggree.  You want something relatively dry to maintain the texture here. The actual flavor isn't too overwhelming, so should work well as a generic bubble gum base. I'd stick to brighter flavors like candy watermelon, Strawberry, or Kiwi. Good place for slightly floral flavors like Raspberry and Peach. Anything too juicy is going to moisten up your bubble gum base too much.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, .25% is too weak. Thin, unsaturated and a bit sour. .5% is better, giving you a more clear bubble gum and filling out the concentrate. Mouthfeel is still a bit weak here though. 1% has a heavier mouthfeel, and doesn't really have an overbearing pinkness to it. 1.5 and 2% still don't have any weird off-flavors, but that chalkyness is getting a bit pronounced.  The cooling here is also starting to get fairly noticeable. By 2% you're getting almost a wintergreen altoids vibe in there with the pink bubblegum. 3% is probably a bit too far, as the vape is getting a bit too dry and harsh and the pink flavor is getting sharp and chemical. I'd suggest starting with this at 1% and working up.  If you're starting with a juicier flavor that you want to dry out a bit, try starting at 2%.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Heres the FLV Product Page.

    "markdown": "##**FLV Butterscotch**##\n\n*Summary*  \nI like this butterscotch a lot, to me it reminds me of a mix between a butterscotch candy and a butterscotch drizzle. You get a nice deep buttery note to give it good body, a dark caramelesque sweetness, and a bit of an astringent bite to it which I find helps cut through some of the more thick or dense vapes. It's not quite as creamy as I would like a butterscotch, but makes for a great butterscotch, caramel, or sweet-buttery accent to a mix. It really benefits from another cream or creamier butterscotch/caramel, in particular FW Butterscotch Ripple for a super decadent butterscotch. \n\n**On the Nose**  \nButter, prominent dark sweetness, slight alcohol note.\n\n**Recommended Usage**  \n*Stand alone*: 3%. Decent but needs help.\n\n*In a mix*: 1-2%\n\n**Throat**  \nModerate\n\n**Pairings**  \nOther caramels/butterscotchs, creams, banana, vanilla, tobacco, coffee. \n\n**Avoid**  \nBright fruits, melons, citrus.  \n\n**Steep**  \n3-4 days.\n\n**Quick Recipe: Butterscotch Banana Frozen Custard**  \n*Ratio: 20PG/80VG*  \n*Steep: 1 week*  \n\n* TFA Banana Cream @ 4%  \n* HS Banana @ .75% \n* FLV Butterscotch @ 2%  \n* FW Butterscotch Ripple @ 3%\n* TFA Vanilla Bean Ice Cream @ 3% \n* CAP Vanilla Custard @ 2% \n\nThis is my go-to butterscotch vape. Butterscotch & Banana pair surprisingly well. As a decadent profile, it lends itself extremely well to super decadent vapes.  \n\nIn this mix, **FLV Butterscotch's** role is to reinforce the butterscotch note and kind of cut through the heavy creams from the Custard, VBIC, and Ripple to offer that buttery dark sweetness you're looking for in a butterscotch. Without it, the butterscotch profile isn't as noticeable as you want it to be, and is a bit too creamy (as if that's possible).   \n\nWhile very tasty and decadent, I don't recommend making something like this your ADV unless you want to snack on your lungs during the movies.  \n\n**Edit - Sub Ideas:** I know a lot of people won't have HS banana if they want to mix this up. It's job here is to just bring the banana flavor a bit more forward. You can try bringing the TFA Banana Cream up a bit more, subbing with FA Banana (1-1.25%), leaving it out, or using your favorite banana in its place (I did try TFA Ripe Banana and was not a fan of how it turned out.)",

Solo, tastes quite a bit like sweet-tarts, although probably better mixed.  Effects vary pretty drastically depending on percentage used.  Gets dry and powdery as you go higher, but that's kind of the point.\n\nSolo, the inhale is sweet with a pretty indistinct candy fruit and tartness. Does taste quite a bit like the general powdery fruit-ish taste of smarties or the inside of cheaper, larger jellybeans. In the ELR Reviews, /u/altneurose/ says it tastes \"similar to mixing TPA Strawberry and CAP Sweet Tangerine,\"  and despite not really tasting strawberry in general, i'd say at least the Cap Sweet Tangerine thing is dead on.  Full mouthfeel, with a chalky texture. Exhale is interesting. First part of the exhale is all sweet-tarts. Chalky, bright fruit with a pronounced tartness in the top notes. Still very sweet, but the texture helps to offset that a bit. Back half of the exhale calms down a bit, with a richer, gummy mouthfeel.

Somewhere between a vanilla jelly bean and the marshmallowesque filling from a charleston chew. Adds some sweetness, but not overwhelming at .25%. Adds a good deal of fullness to the vape, without getting too dry or chalky. .25% seems like a good percentage to use this as a texturizer for candy fillings.  Also working really well with the creaminess of Holy Vanilla, without bringing in any kind of chemical off-notes you can get with other candy texturizers.\n\n*3% FW Root Beer, .5% FLV Candy Roll:*  This one is a bit more interesting.  Definitely getting a bit dryer as the percentage of candy roll goes up.  Also noticeably sweeter. Seems to also be pushing up the sharper notes on the Root Beer. After those sharper notes settle in and mellow a bit, kind of tastes like candy root beer bottle caps, with some added weirdness from the spice notes. Maybe avoid anything too spicy, sharp, or floral unless that's your thing.  Could actually be used with floral concentrates to really push those floral notes up and make floral candies.\n\n*4% OSDIY Blue Raspberry Slush, 1% FLV Candy Roll:* At 1%, this is definitely spot on to a sweet tart.  Quite a bit tarter than Smarties, but just as chalky. Just reinforces the candy sweetness of the blue raspberry and gives the entire thing a chalky, candy texture. At 1% and over, this could be the silver bullet for any kind of chalky or powdery candy.\n\n**Notes:**  Not really a solo flavor for me, more of a texturizer. General usage guidelines would be something like .25 for a jellybean like consistency, and .75%-1.5% to really take advantage of those sweet powdery notes.  If you really want a straight sweet-tart vape, mix at 2% and go to town.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Here's the ELR Page.

    "markdown": "**FLV Cantaloupe**  \n*Summary*  \nThis flavoring offers a really nice cantaloupe flavor that's almost creamy. Very smooth flavor, semi sweet, nice cantaloupe. It's perfectly ripe; I don't detect any of the green parts close to the rind, or rind itself. It does get a little sharp on the throat if used too high. In trying this at a single flavor at 2% and in a mix at 1%, those seem like good places to start with it. The throat was a little sharper than I would like at both of those %s, so if you want to avoid a sharp throat, I might suggest bringing them a touch lower (1.5% & 0.75% respectively).  \n\nOne thing that's interesting about this flavoring is how well it accents fruit and cream mixes, particularly \"orange\" fruits (mango, apricot, peach, etc.). It does a great job at bringing a non-citrus \"orange\" accent to a mix that is smooth and velvety. Experimentations with Mango Lassi found the cantaloupe to round out the mango nicely while also lending some additional creaminess that it needed without any unwanted dairy notes (used @ 0.5%).  \n\n**On the Nose**  \nA subtle, ripe, sweet, cantaloupe-esque scent.\n\n**Usage**  \n*Stand alone*: 1.5-2%. You get a really nice cantaloupe at 2%, but it's a touch harsh; bringing it down to 1.5% reduces the harshness to an acceptable level in my book, but is a bit underwheling by itself.\n\n*In a mix*: 0.25-1% depending if you're going for an \"orange\" creamy aspect, or more forward cantaloupe flavor.  \n\n**Throat**  \nHarsh\n\n**Pairings**  \nCreams, other melons, \"orange\" fruits, berries, other fruits.  \n\n**Avoid**  \nCoffee, heavy caramels/butterscotches, overly eggy or dairy flavors/mixes. I want to say tobacco, but it might actually work well as an accent to like an apricot tobacco or something.  \n\n**Steep**  \nI'd give this one 2 days. It's a fruit so it doesn't need much time for that cantaloupe flavor to come through, but if you want the full effect of the velvety texture it's best to let this one harmonize with the other flavorings for a bit. Seems to hold a steep pretty well from 1-3 weeks, but haven't kept a mix around more than a month. \n\n**Quick Recipe: Melon Mix**  \n*Ratio: 10PG/90VG*  \n*Steep: 3+ days*  \n\n* FLV Wild Melon @ 1.5%  \n* FLV Cantaloupe @ 0.75%  \n* TFA Marshmallow @ 1%  \n* FLV Cream @ 1%  \n\nIn this recipe you can see how the cantaloupe lends itself to accent the melon mixture by offering its delicious sweet cantaloupe flavor, as well as aiding the cream base. If you sub this cantaloupe for a different one, you'd find yourself with a tasty mix that has a good cantaloupe note to it, but it wouldn't be quite as creamy. I find this % of cantaloupe to be enough to push that forward cantaloupe flavor you're looking for, while benefiting the creams and keeping the harsh throat under control.",

Mouthfeel is a little buttery but no real rich, buttery taste to it.  More of a brown sugar simple syrup than full caramel.\n\nInhale is dense brown sugar sweetness. Natural tasting sweetness without any chemical off-flavors. Exhale is relatively thin, with some cooked sugar top notes but mostly a middle-heavy raw brown sugar taste.  Really subtle richness here with a richer mouthfeel than actual taste.  Overall tastes quite a bit thinner than you'd expect from a relatively strong flavor.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Slightly soapy aftertaste solo. A little bit like grabbing a glass the dishwasher didn't quite finish with.  I've never noticed it coming across in a mix.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Light. Raw sugar taste is a bit harsh.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I'd use this a lot like TFA Brown Sugar Extra, a richer dark sweetener.  Good fit for bakery applications, as that brown sugar sweetness does taste a little cooked and fairly natural.\n\n/u/joesepaa/ mentions a RY4 in the second opinions a bit later, and that does seem like a natural fit. This would be great as a sweetener for tobacco mixes without adding any weird candy or sucralose notes.\n\nTastes a bit raw for lighter creams, but it could bump up some brulee notes or sweetness with a custard mix.\n\nLacks the body or richness I'd want from a solo caramel.  I don't see getting to a full caramel without a different caramel concentrate in the mix. Even with the diketones here, doesn't seem to be much richer than FA Caramel. \n\n**Notes:**\n\nS&V Concentration testing, what little richness I get here comes in low.  As low as 1% and I get about all the buttery notes that seem to be available here.  That raw brown sugar and  sweetness scale up from there.  I'd mix with this at 1% if I was just shooting for whatever caramel this brings to the table. I'd bump up to 2 to 3% if you're mostly after the sweetness here.  This definitely isn't a solo concentrate for me, just because I find that raw sugar note off-putting by itself.\n\nOverall, seems like a good sweetener, but not a great caramel.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nIt's probably worth noting that I've heard rich used quite a bit to describe this.  A couple reviews on [flavorah's site](http://store.flavorah.com/concentrated-caramel-flavor) and [one review on ECX](http://www.ecigexpress.com/diy-e-liquid/browse-flavorings/dessert-flavors/caramel-by-flavorah.html) talk about this richness.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Carrot, .25, 1, and 3% 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 3 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Raw carrots. Moderately sweet carrot body with a stronger peel note.\n\nPretty solid carrot body. Not overly juicy, but not completely dry. Moderately dense mouthfeel.  Body definitely fits in with the raw carrot, as opposed to carrot juice.\n\nSweetness level overall is actually pretty realistic.  Solid but not overwhelming sweetness.  More like a juice carrot than a baby carrot.  The bitterness of the peel is reining in some of the sweeter body.\n\nThat peel is mostly in the top notes and is pretty realistic, but still kind of a bummer if you were looking for a straight bakery carrot.  Peel is a bit bitter and astringent but not particularly earthy.  It's like eating a thoroughly washed, but still slightly bigger and unpeeled carrot.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  It's a raw carrot.  That peel note is a bit aggressive for a sweeter cooked, or bakery carrot. Nothing in the profile that doesn't belong there and nothing chemical, but it's definitely raw and unpeeled.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Moderate to fairly harsh, especially on the tail end of the exhale where that peel comes in.  Maybe a step off of FLV Persimmon or FA Passionfruit, but there's a pretty solid throat hit here.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At .25%, I'm actually get a fairly distinct carrot flavor, it's just a bit thin.  Peel note isn't overwhelming, there's definitely some sweetness here, but there isn't much body.\n\nAt 1%, the peel here is definitely kicking up.  I still don't think it's too overwhelming, but it's pushing the body of the carrot to the back a little. The body I do get is relatively full, sweet, and tastes like a carrot.  May be more useful for a carrot juice type of flavor around this level.\n\nAt 3%, this is almost spooky realistic, especially on a fresh drip.  Intense carrot flavor, but it's unpeeled and that peel is pretty aggressive.\n\nThis actually gives a pretty clear carrot peel flavor down low.  I'd use this between .25-5% for a carrot accent if you want to chase glory and be the one to figure out a carrot cake.  For juicier fruity applications, I'd mix between 1-2% with the idea that you're going to be adding in some selective muting for that throat hit. If you want a dead on carrot vape, then mix at 3% and go nuts.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Seems like more of a carrot for fruit blends because of that fairly aggressive peel.  Should mix pretty well citrus in general and oranges in specific.  I'd also look at red or fuji apples or pear. Carrot and pineapple works pretty well together as well, although it gets weird with other tropicals.\n\nGinger is also a pretty awesome flavor with carrot, and the spiciness of the ginger should help to clean up some of the heavy peel note here.\n\nIf you've got an iron throat or use some pretty heavy EM or other muting agent, FLV Persimmon is one of the first things that popped into my mind.\n\nSince that peel note is higher up in the flavor, and carries pretty well at lower percentages. It should be a decent choice for something like a carrot cake, given a low accent mixing percentage.  I still wouldn't call this a bakery carrot per se, but given the fairly limited options, this may be a decent way forward.\n\nThe only other carrot flavor i've tried is [RF SC Carrot](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/6hqajj/rf_sc_carrot/) and I like this one quite a bit more.  I feel like it has some of the issues in terms of the actual flavor, but for whatever reason the way this vapes is substantially less weird.  Also, it doesn't have a ton of cloudy orange sediment like the RF SC version.  I would recommend this over the RF SC Carrot without any kind of reservations.\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Cherimoya @ 1% and 1 drop per 10ml (about .25%), 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 8 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Pineapple forward, with some softer vaguely tropical tasting sweet, soft fruit base after that. I can pick out some apple, mango and coconut. Realistic sweetness and tart acidity.\n\nInhale is sharp and sweet. Lots of pineapple here with a softer mango candy type of flavor. Moderately dense.  Not a lot of throat hit, but the sharpness definitely leaves your mouth a bit raw.  On the exhale, you definitely notice that pineapple kind of note first, especially at higher percentages. Higher tart notes with some acidity. The rest of the fruit starts to come in after the pineapple fades a a bit. Golden delicious apple base with some really soft mango and coconut sweetness.  Tastes a bit indistinct after that pineapple up front.  Sweet, but a pretty natural sweetness. Lingering tart pineapple and raw mouthfeel and a bit of an apple peel kind of taste.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Not really. Lots going on, but nothing I haven't tasted in other custard apple / cherimoya type of concentrates.\n\n**Throat Hit:** This has a bit of acidic brightness, so it can get just a bit harsh. Nothing too extreme, but it's there.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This suffers from some of the drawbacks of other custard apple flavors, namely that it's a fairly complex flavor on it's own and it'll be difficult to find a way to use this where it isn't the star of the show or a pretty far in the background.  Works well with a cream base.  Can also be used as an accent flavor for some tropical-ity for lack of a better descriptor.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, this varies a lot based on percentage. At .25%, seems a bit too light. Good bright pineapple pop at the beginning, but the back end of feels softer and muted. .5% tastes a lot fuller, still good acidity up front and I'm getting a bit more on the backend, but it feels like it'll be too light to really stand up in a mix.  1% tastes fairly similar to .5%, maybe a bit more body on the back. Still feels like it struggling to get some body.  1.5% is getting a little sharp, with that pineapple coming in pretty clearly up front and pushing the back end a lot. Fuller overall, I could see being able to pick this out in a mix.  Backup fruit comes back with a vengance at 2%.  Still on the sharp side, but you're getting some body back.  At 3%, this is feeling a bit overblown. Kind of an acidic pineapple with a juicy-fruit kind sweetness on the back end. Honestly, this one is a bit odd based on concentration. I'd recommend working low on this an accent, starting at .5%.  If you want a fuller cherimoya flavor in a mix with competing flavors, maybe start at 1.75% and work up.\n\nPutting this in the greater custard apple context, this tastes the most similar to INW Cherimoya, but simultaneously fuller and less sharp.  INW Cherimoya gets a bit weird and sharp when you're trying to push it into the forefront of a recipe, but this doesn't seem to do that.  Out of the trifecta of Flavorah custard apples, this seems to be the most mellow and stripped down. It doesn't seem to have either the intense fruitiness of FLV Guanabana or the tartness of FLV Soursop.  Picking out the nuances on these flavors is a bit of a bear, but this seems to be lacking both the heavier banana of guanabana or the sourish apple of Soursop. This feels the most like a creamy, cohesive slightly muted apple, mango, banana, and coconut mix with more pineapple sharpness, although I'm not sure if it's a heavier pineapple flavor or there is just less going on in the background.  Feels more like a muted tropical background noise after the pineapple, at least compared to FLV Guanabana and Soursop.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[u/CheebaSteeba/ 's take from the FOTW on custard apples:](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/5n4rli/an_exotic_flavor_of_the_week_the_custard_apple/) \n\n\"I almost feel like they made this concentrate for me lol. Although I've yet to work it in to a recipe or really play with it much outside of SFT, I will say this one definitely takes the cake over INW (depending on what you're going for of course). The flavor is very much more pronounced, a little bit more tart -- which puts it closer in authenticity to the actual fruit -- with the pineapple note shining through more, and to me it was slightly harsh on the throat at 3% (prob too high). I would definitely recommend pairing this one with creams to bring out more of that smooth custardy note and to tame some of the harsher notes coming from it.\"\n\n[Heres the Flavorah product page.  Their description: \"Like Soursop and Guanabana, this tropical flavor is an exotic delight.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Cherry Blossom, .25, 1, and 3%, others noted, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 8 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  A more floral take on a cherry blossom flavor.  Light, floral cherry and some leafy green notes.\n\nThe cherry here is relatively subtle.  It's light and floral, but on the flip side of that it doesn't have too many overwhelming off notes.  It's a lighter, non-juicy type of cherry flavor but it doesn't cross fully into dry and chalky.  The relative strength of that cherry note seems to vary pretty heavily based on percentage.  It definitely needs a higher percentage to really take center stage, but it's working pretty well as an accent.\n\nI'd say this is more green than strictly floral.  It's not like FA Jasmine or FLV Hibiscus green, but there's some actual vegetation in here.  It's relatively leafy and bright, and I'm not getting anything too warm or swampy.  This does pick up more of a traditional perfumey floral edge at higher percentages, but it's not too aggressive.\n\nThis feels just a bit top heavy, but that's probably par for the course with something that leans green and floral. Not too thin, but no real heavy base here to latch on to.  Sweetness level is moderate.  Sweet for floral, but not candy sweet.\n\nComparing this to TPA Cherry Blossom, the FLV version seems a bit more focused on the blossom part. TPA Cherry Blossom is more a slightly chalky cherryish candy flavor, while this has a more pronounced floral edge and some actual greener notes.  I'd say the cherry is a bit more pronounced in the TPA Version but it can also come off medicinal.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  I imagine this tastes a lot like actually eating a cherry blossom.  Not unpleasantly green, but it's there.  It's a different take on the profile if you're used to TPA Cherry Blossom.  Nothing too chemical or strange at 3% or under.\n\n**Throat Hit:**Light to moderate. Gets a bit perfumey at higher percentages, and that green note is just a bit harsh.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At .25%, I'm not getting much in the way of cherry.  Pretty prominent green flavor here. More leafy than vegetal. Just a hint of a floral cherry at the back end.\n\nAt 1% there's a bit better balance here. Still not a real aggressive cherry, but it's in there as an accent to that green flavor.  Getting sweeter but not cloying.\n\nAt 3% I'm getting a clearer cherry.  Cherry forward.  The blossom part of this feels less leafy, and a bit more like a sweet green accent to the cherry.  Sweet, with just little bit of perfumey bitterness at the the tail end of the exhale. Fairly mellow for a floral up this high.\n\nJust based on these tests, this feels fairly flexible in terms of use percentage.  I'd probably start around 1% if you want the herbal blossom thing up front, and up to 3% if you want the cherry to be more prominent..\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I think both this and FLV Sugar Orchid definitely have a cherry blossom vibe and they seem to complement each other pretty well. Mixing about 2% FLV Cherry Blossom and .25% FLV Sugar Orchid, I'm getting something that feels like a slightly softer version of TPA Cherry Blossom with a floral vanilla accent.  It's working strangely well together.  So if you're into cherry blossom, that might be worth a shot.\n\nOutside of that, I think this is going to be useful if you want a more realistic cherry blossom flavor with some green to it.  With the greener note here I think this might end up being a bit better with teas if you want a more subtle cherry accent than you'd get from FLV Sugar Orchid.  And I'll just throw out the gin thing again.\n\nPairing this with fruits, I think this will bring more of a floral edge into things than both TPA Cherry Blossom and FLV Sugar Orchid.  I don't necessarily thing the pairings are really different, but the end result is going to end up a bit more floral.  You could either roll with it and work with something like berries that will handle that floral a bit better, or fight back harder with more syrupy and saturated bright fruits.  I do think this will go really well with citruses.\n\nThe green note here probably means other cherry blossomish flavors are a better choice for creams or bakeries.\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Sweet chocolate. \n\n**Notes:**  So, what if the problem with cherry concentrates is an attempt to create a bright cherry note? I tried FLV Cherry Filling looking for a more subdued cooked cherry.  Maybe a little sweet and jammy with that comparatively subtle cherry note.\n\nThis is no way tastes realistic.  It's way too artificial and bright for a real cherry filling.  It's a too light and one-note for even a cheap hostess fruit pie neon red fruit filling.  It really does taste quite a bit like cherry gummies and whatever they are using for mouthfeel reinforces that.  It leaves a mouthfeel like cheap gummy bears, as opposed to either a nice rich pectin heavy natural filling or a corn starch thickened neon \"cherry\" filling.\n\nI'd say its a mostly competent cherry candy concentrate.",

Really prime as a standalone, one you surely don't want to miss out on if you like German Chocolate Cake. It's got a delectable cakey chocolate, and a tasty sweet coconut undertone to it. Even though this flavoring is great by itself, its complexity does make it somewhat more difficult to mix with. Its obvious role is going to be bakeries focusing on chocolate and coconut, not many other directions it can be taken due to the pronounced chocolate and coconut. I feel like if they were able to take just the cakiness from this they would have a pretty great sub for FW Yellow Cake. \n\n**On the Nose**  \nA sweet coconut, medium-dark chocolate, bready notes.\n\n**Usage**  \n*Stand alone*: 1.5-2.5%. Just try it as a stand alone -- you'll be impressed\n\n*In a mix*: 1-2%. \n\n**Throat**  \nMild.\n\n**Pairings**  \nOther coconuts chocolates and bakery notes, caramel, hazelnut, vanilla, tobacco, coffee, dark fruits. \n\n**Avoid**  \nBright fruits, citrus.  \n\n**Steep**  \nSurprisingly good right away. I didn't notice any big differences during steeping.\n\n**Recipe Ideas**  \nAlthough I've tried a few iterations of a \"German Chocolate Cake,\" I haven't been successful in making a mix that is better than this as a stand-alone. Bringing some caramel to the party is a great idea, as well as some coconut (TFA Coconut Candy seemed to be a good direction). I imagine HS Australian Chocolate or another good dark chocolate will play really nicely. \n\nProbably the most notable recipes I was able to find were these two:  \n\n* **[Rumpelstiltskin](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/411vh9/do_you_need_a_quick_dense_cakey_coconut_chocolate/)** by /u/InsigmaTheory  \n* **[DaMomma's German Chocolate Cake](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/recipe/138232/DaMomma%2527s+German+Chocolate+Cake)** by Alisa",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Cinnamon Roll @ 1% and 1 drop per 10ml, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 11 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Another mystifying Flavorah bakery that doesn't have a whole lot of bakery in there right out of the gate.  I'm getting a clear cinnamon that's not quite as robust as straight FLV Rich Cinnamon and has a bit of lighter, spicier note without that heavy body.  There's also a touch of an icing note, mostly an errant sweetness.  But there is no real bread to this flavor, and it seems to be lacking body all around.\n\nInhale is mostly high, spicy cinnamon notes with a dense neutral body. Some sweetness, but nothing reads as cinnamon roll levels.  Exhale is again, mostly cinnamon and a dense, kind of plain volume. Cinnamon up front and the top notes, not quite the body of Rich Cinnamon, more like flavorah's fire cinnamon or spicier version of FA Cinnamon Ceylon. Lots of fairly dense volume, but there's not a lot of flavor here.  Some light bready notes, but you really can't call it a cinnamon roll taste.  Base sweetness, but not icing sweet.  Mouthfeel is a bit heavy and grainy, just missing an actual bread flavor.\n \n**Off-flavors:**  More from what isn't here.  I don't get much, if any, bread or dough, and that icing note could easily just be the base sweetness of the concentrate.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  The cinnamon here is a bit spicy, but not classically harsh.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Seems like another bridge flavor from flavorah, where they're just giving you a thinner sketch of a flavor and they want to build around it. Plenty of cinnamon, but for a cinnamon roll you are going to need the actual roll, and probably some sort of icing. Testing this S&V with .25% AP, you can get some of those bready, fuller notes back, but then you are having to use a fairly heavy hand to get a frosting to show through here.\n\nIf you don't want to use this to build a cinnamon roll, this may have some use as a bakery cinnamon addtive.  It's less intense than Rich Cinnamon, but it does have a good, strong spicy note and some heavier mouthfeel and sweetness that would fit into apple pies, coffee cakes, and bread pudding.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, the cinnamon is going to be the limiting factor. At .25%, I get a clear cinnamon and not a whole lot else. Decent volume, but no strong flavor to it. .5% doesn't take markedly different from .5%, maybe a bit stronger cinnamon.  1% has a pretty up-front bakery cinnamon, denser volume, but still no bread to be found.  1.5% is pretty bold on the cinnamon front, definitely on the spicy side.  Good volume, and I'm getting just a touch of breadyness but the volume here is starting to get a bit cardboardy.  2% is my usuable limit here. Cinnamon is still getting just a bit too intense.  Whether using this build a cinnamon roll, or a bakery cinnamon additive, this is an accent flavor all the way.  I'd recommend starting with this at .5% for a bakery cinnamon additive, and 1.25% to hang all the cinnamon roll flavors off of.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[One note on ELR by user Brian_SFL:](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/112174) \n\n\"astonishingly accurate cin roll under 2%;FLV rich cinnamon flavor is built in. Less is more, consider a super-concentrate. .4 - 1% should be enough in mixes, and for me no other cinnamon ingredients are needed/wanted when using this.\nTop shelf.\n\nI can't say I agree, but maybe I'm just not picking up the bread here.\n\n\n\n[Heres the Flavorah product page.  Their description: \"Cinnamon roll bready and buttered, but this one won’t make you fat. It is a canvas for adding more, like frosting, cinamon or more dough. Very useful as a base cinnamon bakery flavor. \"](http://store.flavorah.com/concentrated-cinnamon-roll-flavor)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Clove @ .25%. 60/40 VG/PG, steeped 9 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Do you actually like cloves? Like, really like cloves? This is cloves.  Pretty damn analogous to FLV Rich Cinnamon in that it's bold, ridiculously strong, way too expensive, and pretty great. More of a djarum clove kind of flavor solo, instead of a softer baked or mulled clove. Has a bit of a drier texture and almost wood-spice kind warmth that mimics smoking clove cigarettes fairly well.  Flavor settles in after a while, but it avoids getting sour and thin like FA Clove or chemical-ish like TFA Clove.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Nah. I mean, it's a bit dry? That doesn't seem like an off-flavor for cloves though.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Nothing weird, but it's a strong clove flavor, so you'll definitely feel it.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  The super obvious one is tobacco pairing. The spicy warmth here is going to work really well with a non-green kind of tobacco flavor.  Maybe throw in some vanilla, and you are definitely approaching clove cigarettes.\n\nFor a bakery clove, you'll want to work with a dilution, as this will stomp anything too subtle unless you use a really light hand.  This could totally work as your bakery clove, though.  Works well with drier and nutty bakeries.\n\nFruit parings, I like cloves with bananas and oranges... but follow your bliss here and work with a dilution.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nConcentration testing, this is strong stuff.  At .25% I get a very rich, full clove flavor.  You may be able to work this with tobaccos up to about .5%.  Solo, flavorah suggests 1-2% but that seems crazy to me.  If you're working outside of tobaccos you will absolutely have to do a 10% of dilution, then start at 1% and work up.\n\nSo this is expensive. Like $12.49 for 15ml.  I can't imagine ever actually using the entire bottle though. It's that strong.  I picked a 5ml from gremlin for $6 and I'm pretty sure that'll last me for a couple of years.\n\nReally good stuff. Totally the rich cinnamon of the clove world.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[So i finally took the plunge on picking this one up after reading /u/shrine399/ 's report about the owner of flavorah talked about how underrated this flavor is.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/3pk3t9/tfa_clove/)  After finally getting on the Rich Cinnamon hype train, I took the plunge.\n\n[Some usage tips here, mostly just make a dilution.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/3roj7c/taming_of_the_clove/)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Coffee @ 1% and 1 drop per 10ml, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 11 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Dark roasted coffee with a lot of dark cocoa and some coconut. Heavy vape, with a creamy mouthfeel under the higher, darkly roasted bitter notes.  Sub 1%, manages to avoid most of the burnt, buttery notes that turn people off coffee.. but there isn't a ton of identifiable straight coffee here, so it's a bit of mixed bag.  Tastes like a cleaner, more darkly roasted version of INW Mocca.  Definitely on the strong side, should put itself front and center damn near anywhere you try to put it.\n\nInhale has a lot of cocoa. Darkly roasted, with a kind of pleasant bitter, really slightly burnt note in the top notes.  Dense, with a heavier, creamy mouthfeel and a not overwhelming sweetness.  Exhale has black coffee right up front, with dark chocolate following close behind. Again, darkly roasted but not quite at that buttery, burnt level as some other coffees.  More like a really high cocoa percentage dark chocolate than a more authentic dark espresso roast. Creamy base, with a pretty distinct coconut kind of taste especially towards the very tail end of the exhale. Sweetness has a bit of weird fruityness at .5%, but I don't really pick it up at .25 or 1%.  Lingering dark chocolate bitterness and slight burnt note with some fatty coconut cream kind of taste.\n \n**Off-flavors:**  I'm getting a lot of cocoa and coconut out of this.  Coffee itself can have a bunch of varying flavor profiles, so it isn't necessarily off but it's a bit different than I'd expect from a straight coffee concentrate.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Light. Nothing major or especially sharp.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:** Sweeter coffee vapes.  It's 75% of the way there solo at .5%. Creamy texture, if not a real distinct cream taste so something like FW Hazelnut and sweeter cream of choice would get you in the ballpark.\n\nSeems like a good coffee for bakeries with a coffee component. Cocoa and coconut here would work well with a grainier base and extra sweetness.\n\nThe deleted user from the second opinions brings up cocktail vapes, and this would probably do a good job standing in for kahlua.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, at .25% this is resoundingly okay.  Almost a hot chocolate inhale, with a bit of black coffee and a softer coconut smoothness to exhale. .5% has a bit more aggressive coffee note, but still coming across as mostly cocoa on the inhale with a bit of raisin-y sweetness.  The exhale has dark chocolate, coffee, and coconut in there.  Still no real burnt note to the coffee flavor. 1% is pretty intense. I'm getting a bit of a burnt note on the inhale and a whole lot of it on the exhale. Not quite the buttery burnt of FA Dark Bean yet, but it's a really, really dark roast.  Coconut is getting a bit fatty and weird as well. I'd recommend using this at .25% as an accent, and maybe .75% as a main note. People seem have to a varying sensitivity for these kind of flavors, so maybe start lower than you'd think and work up.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[The deleted user strikes again: \"Coconut and caramel up front followed by very clean coffee flavor. Sweet and slightly bitter with some sort of neutral front-of-the-tongue (grapey) fruitiness (ethyl acetate?) Vapes a little coffee “liqueur-esque” (alcohol?) but the coffee flavor is clean and free of unwanted off-notes. Nice little hint of organic earthiness in the exhale. Cocktail time! Add coffee backbone to cloying mixes. Try in place of coconut. Might be interesting in tobaccos. Caution using with additional coconut. May amplify fruit flavors a bit in mixes. Try @ 1% to start.\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/30arnc/my_flv_tasting_notes_coffee/)\n\n[U/trancinate/ 's take on a post griping about coffee flavors: \"FLV Coffee is spot-on perfect black coffee.

I think Kentucky is a bit spicier, Native has more ash, and Commercial Cigarette does the citrus thing. Would have to put em all side by side to really notice more than that.

    "markdown": "First let me start off by saying two things; tobacco flavored ejuice super-duper freaks meowt. My previous experience with it was in 2012, when I was using a cig-a-like with refillable liquid cartomizers, and I bought all my juices from the same incredible vendor, one that had, up until this point, rolled out nothing but hits for me.\n\nI was about 6 months quit, and starting to itch for an analog, because cig-a-like, so I thought the solution was to maybe stray from my preferred coffee, cream and floral vapes and dip a toe in the tobacco waters. Elvis Fucking Christ, what a colossal mistake that turned out to be.\n\nFor those who have never had the pleasure, allow me to describe what tobacco ejuice was like back then. Fish all the butts out of a dangerously full, dirty ashtray, but leave the ash and fragments of half-charred tobacco shag. Sprinkle liberally with a lot of barbershop talc and deglaze with some cold, long-forgotten Earl Grey tea, ideally with milk, that's formed a nice scum on top. Add a dash of cheap perfume you bought from a guy selling “Paris Fragrance” and incense off a blanket outside Downtown Crossing station. Whisk until frothy, then strain through the discarded stocking of a hooker that died of Guinness World Book Records-worthy athlete's foot. Drip into crappy (But clean! Though it won't be after this!) plastic carto with silica wicks and vape at 4.2 watts because you don't know no bettah'. Keep a bucket handy.\n\nSide note: my neighbor's toddler is having a straight-up meltdown in our shared driveway right now, and I swear, it is my fault. I mean, that sissy bitch has a couple meltdowns every day, usually way earlier than this, but, my recollection of how awful tobacco ejuice is seems so potent that I feel like there is a sickly, gray-green miasma emanating from my house and overtaking the 'hood like a poisoned fog. Wow, I've got earbuds in, and he is straight up bleeding through those *and* my closed windows. Get it the fuck together, Colton! Preschool in Boston is not going to be kind to your pansy ass.\n\nAnyway, the other thing I wanted to say was, sorry, /u/ID10-T! I know you were hoping for a real disaster of a review, where I just acted out vigorous vomiting in onomatopoeia form, but, this flavor is a surprise to us both!  \n\n**My Build/Wattage**: 7 wraps, Kanthal, 26 guage, at 2.0mm, 20-25 watts on an RTA, Japanese organic cotton wicking.   \n**What It Smells Like In The Bottle**: Smoky soy sauce with a touch of burned black coffee and mahogany, which made me totally tumescent.   \n**Percentage & Steep Time**: 3% in a 70/30 VG/PG Mix.1 Month to the day, which I could hardly wait for.\nThroat Hit: Like a 4.5 out of 10. It starts out bold, but seems to smooth out pretty quickly.  \n**What I Look Forward To Trying To Mix It With**: INW Wera Garden Coffee, which was one of my first flavor buys, so, yeah, mistake, and it has always tasted like burnt hair when I tried to mix it with any creams, but this might finally be the place for it! Also; FA Black Fire, FA Clove, FA Honey, TFA Brown Sugar and FW Hazelnut.  \n**What You Should Avoid Mixing It With**: Honestly, I'm having a hard time with this, and that's likely due to my lack of experience mixing with tobacco flavors. I want to say almost every fruit, but, maybe apple might be nice? Or a cherry, fig or plum? Anything bright would be bad. Try it solo first. You'll see what I mean .  \n**But Runt, How Does It Vape?**: Honestly, like a dream. I'm so glad I found this before fall/winter. I can see myself leaning on this a lot. It's leathery, but not in a motorcycle jacket way. It's smoky, but not in a bonfire way. It's sweet, but not in a RY4 way. Dig if you will a picture: It's like a touch of black honey on the very tip of your tongue on the inhale, and then you exhale pure antique books and rich Corinthian leather as you reach for your peaty, smoky, single malt, which is sitting on an intricately carved Indian rosewood end table. \n\nIt's not quite a pipe tobacco, I don't think, though it could easily be shaped into that. This is a really classic, idealized tobacco flavor, like “2012 Me” was hoping for. It's much more savory than a RY4, which limits your mix-ins, but opens up a wealth of disused flavors that you might have given up on. If you want to vape like a Sir, give it a shot solo. This might be your jam.  \n**What To Pair It With**: Drinks-wise: anything single-malt, whiskey & bourbon, too! A nice stout. Or, an Old Fashioned with a touch of extra orange zest. Coffee. Black Tea. Food-wise? Try it after BBQ or Indian. A good beef stew, or maybe a steak & ale pie. A starchy mid-western casserole? This will go well with winter comfort food for sure!  \n**TL;DR**: mix this up at 3% 70/30 VG/PG at the nic level of choice for all those old schoolers that “don't want no fruity flavors” to quit with. Try it that way for a fall/wintry change for yourself, then dream of all the tasty shit you can work into it, then POST THOSE RECIPES! Share your creations with this flavor, because, my palate is ready!\n\nEDIT: Here's a link to /u/T_Mace's more current review of this flavor, which beautifully illustrates the benefit of multiple flavor reviews, and the subjective nature of taste.\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/59s8p4/connecticut_shade_flavorah/?context=10",

It tastes nothing like a cookie. At least not one I've ever tried. There is no, that I can detect, acetyl pyrazine. Not the normal 'Cookie' notes we are use to. If you were hoping for a uber concentrated FA Cookie replacement this isn't it.  There are some baked notes but not the kind you would expect from a cookie. Almost like really dry cake without the moistness or savory richness. It does have a maple syrup taste noticeable at 3%. The exact same flavor you get from FLV Cupcake Batter but way more forward. Almost as if it was some type of maple cake/cookie. I can't really claim that it's a background note because it tastes like it's suppose to be the main flavor note. A slight creamy baked maple flavor is all i'm really getting from this.\n\n**Throat hit**: Nothing of note/ incredibly smooth. It does not have a normal dryness that you would expect a cookie type flavor to have.\n\n**Off-flavors**: Maple Syrup \n\n**Uses**: This flavor at 3% isn't incredibly strong as a single flavor. I can see this being used at 1.5% - 2% in a mix for more of a background note or supporting flavor. But honestly, I'm having a hard time figuring out when you would use this.\n\n**Notes**: I'm was more critical than I usually would be simply because of the price of this. I would never knowingly pay so much for a maple syrup flavor. I'm personally disappointed in this flavor but I encourage some else with more of a refined palate and creativity to give this a shot because maybe I'm missing something here.\n\n/u/Flavorah responded with the following to help explain what exactly this flavor profile this is supposed to fill. It explains a lot more as to why it tastes the way it does. \n\n> Sorry that it does not have the dry cookie you were looking for /u/chewymidget For cookie, it was supposed to be that moment when you add the brown sugar, vanilla and butter together with the flour, not the dryer already baked cookie. Our biscotti flavor is made to be more dry, and adding a nut like peanut butter or beer nuts can easily bring out the dryness but it is easier to layer those on top, then it is to go backwards from a dry note. Also, we didn't want this to be a chocolate chip cookie right out of the bottle, but if you want it to be I think it can be successfully added in. If we made it dry, I would expect people to say \"where's the chocolate chips?\"\n",

It is sweet and can definitely taste the granules of sugar in the dough. This flavor has a nice thick mouth feel. It even has a greasy note to it that packaged cookie dough has.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  If you count the grease, but I think it adds to the authenticity of the cookie dough\n\n**Throat Hit:**  This flavor is moderately harsh on its own.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I can see this flavor being used to thicken up some mixes as it has a very nice full mouth feel.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Cool Menthol @ Various, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 5 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  It's menthol, more or less. I don't really pick up much going on here besides the menthol.  It's smooth and pretty concentrated, but it's a $7.49 bottle of menthol... so there's that.  .25% is fairly strong, but still pleasant and it just takes off from there.  Seems to be somewhere around 2 or 3 times stronger than a normal 10% menthol solution.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Normal menthol off-flavors at higher percentages.  A bit less chemical and bitter than other menthols I've tried, but still has a grassy note if you overdo it.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Standard menthol throat hit. Icy bite on inhale and exhale, no added harshness when used low. I get a bit of light chemical edge when mixing with a heavy hand, but it seems a little less pronounced than my generic menthol at equivalent levels of cooling.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:** Yeah, it's just menthol.  In general, better for mints and fruits than anything involving creams or bakeries. If you do want some coolness in a cream, like for a milkshake, look at Koolada instead, which is more subtle and lives more in the exhale.\n\n**Notes:**  Again, this feels fairly concentrated. My usual menthol is just a bottle of Wizard Labs 10% menthol solution, and this feels at least twice as strong.  Concentration testing was done in a mix with 1% FLV Cranberry. .25% is definitely noticeable. Just a menthol coolness.  .5% is a solid menthol. Deeper coolness but still no harsh bite. I'm start to get some bitter, slightly grassy menthol flavor in there as well.  It's still subtle here, but noticeable.  At 1%, I'm getting a bit of bite and a more pronounced menthol flavor on top of the icyness. The slightly grassy taste is getting a little vegetal and a there is a bit of sting to it. I still don't pick up a clear mint or anything like that. Worth nothing that 1% caused some crystallization in the bottle.  I mixed 10ml in a 15ml glass bottle, and the head space had some visible crystalization where the juice had been up on the sides and fell back down.  Menthol is pretty subjective, but I think it'll work better closer to .25% here.  I'm not a huge fan of overly mentholated juices, but at 1% it feels closer to my 10% menthol solution at 2.5 or 3%.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[The semi-illustrious \"deleted user\": \"At 2% exhibits pleasant wintergreen flavor with a good bit of chill. Not quite the impact of Koolada or Ice but definitely cold. Chill impact more nasal rather than back of throat as with ECX Menthol.  Fine solo as a wintergreen vape. Should be nice for allergy season. Try with mints and the usual suspects.\"  I don't get the wintergreen nuance they are talking about, and I don't really see how you need 2% of this stuff.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/32o3wy/my_flv_tasting_notes_cool_menthol/)\n\n[A couple notes on ELR.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Cotton Candy @ 1% and 1 drop per 10ml (about .25%), 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 7 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Gritty, dry spun sugar.  No real \"flavor\" on it's own, mostly a texutured sweetness.   I was hoping this wasn't just ethyl maltol, but it seems like at least some of what's going on here.  Testing it side by side with 1% TPA 10% Ethyl Maltol, they have a lot of the same dry spun sugar texture.  FLV Cotton Candy doesn't seem to have the slight chemical off-note that the straight EM has, and FLV Cotton Candy is a bit sweeter with less dryness at the same percentages.  FLV Cotton Candy also seems to have bit of marshmallow fluffiness in addition to the spun sugar grit and maybe just a hint of vanilla here that you can feel in the top notes, as opposed to being a distinct taste.\n\nTesting this solo, not a ton going on. Inhale is obviously sweet, and moderately dense.  I'm not getting anything but sweetness.  More of a white sugar note as opposed to sucralose, with a moderate amount of grittiness and texture. Exhale is again, just textured sugar.  I feel like there is some subtle vanilla in the top notes, more of a mouthfeel thing than a clear flavor. Exhale moves from kind of gritty to fluffy.  Finishes like a really clean marshmallow flavor. Sweetness overall is not overwhelming, but pretty solid. A bit of dryness along with that gritty then fluffy mouthfeel.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Not as many as some of other cotton candy flavors. Lacking the chemical tinge of straight EM.  Tastes a good deal like straight white sugar, and the mouthfeel is a fairly good approximation of cotton candy.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light.  Nothing all that bad. Harshness on this closer to something like FW Blueberry Cotton Candy, as opposed to much harsher CAP Blue Raspberry Cotton Candy.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This should work as a cotton candy base without any major issues. I'd go for brighter candy flavors like Strawberry or Blue Raspberry.  Your basic blue or pink cotton candy.  Could work with some other fruits, but I'd avoid anything too juicy to preserve the texture here.\n\nAs a sweetener or additive, use is pretty versatile.  Some kind of EM component here, so it seems to boost the inherent sweetness of flavors. The added sweetness beyond the EM component is going to work more like sucralose and give the entire mix a sweetness boost.  Trying this S&V with FW Blood Orange, I'm getting some of the EM rounding on the sharper citrus notes while boosting the sweetness like sucralose.\n\n**Notes:**  S&V concentration testing, this is noticeable but light at .25% and .5%.  Probably more useful as a sweetener at this level. At 1%, I'm starting to get a fuller cotton candy mouthfeel and sweetness.  1.5% is a solid cotton candy base. Solid sweetness and defined mouthfeel.  2% is doable, but maybe a little intense if you're not a huge fan of super sweet mixes. 3% is too sweet and a bit harsh. Some bitterness and the dryness up this high.  I'd recommend starting with this at .25% as a sweetener, and 1.25% as a cotton candy base.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nNot a ton.\n\n[ELR seems to like this at 3%, user \"T-Bone\" reports: \"Spot on cotton candy at 3% SnV. Smooth zero throat hit. Sweet authentic cotton candy\"](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/141659)\n\n[Heres the Flavorah product page.

    "markdown": "##**FLV Cream**##\n\n*Summary*  \nThis is my favorite cream right now. I've started using it in mixes in place of FA Fresh Cream. It brings a good body to a cream base without being too heavy or overwhelmingly \"dairy\" while still giving a pleasant creamy smoothness. It does offer a very slight sweetness, and really helps harmonize flavors.  \n\nA lot of people claimed they sensed a sort of \"spice\" to it, which I didn't detect in any of my mixes. After trying it as a standalone though, there is definitely a bit of spice to it. IDK Why but I went for it at 3.5%, and I get almost like an horchata flavor from it, which I find very interesting. In mixes at .5-1% I don't detect the spice.\n\n**On the Nose**  \nHeavy cream, slight dairy note, light sweetness and/or spice  \n\n**Usage**  \n*Stand alone*: 2.5-3%. Actually not bad by itself, reminds me of like a spiced milk or dairy version of horchata.  \n\n*In a mix*: .5-1.5% Depending on how prevalent you want the cream; 1% is the sweet spot for me\n\n**Throat**  \nMild.  \n\n**Pairings**  \nOther creams, pretty much every fruit except maybe cherry? Caramel, Butterscotch, Coffee, bakeries, damn near everything.  \n\n**Avoid**  \nOnly thing I can think of is like candies or tobaccos since it will change the profile.  \n\n**Steep**  \n1-2 days.\n\n**Quick Recipe: Melon Mix**  \n*Ratio: 10PG/90VG*  \n*Steep: 3+ days*  \n\n* FLV Wild Melon @ 1.5%  \n* FLV Cantaloupe @ 0.75%  \n* TFA Marshmallow @ 1%  \n* FLV Cream @ 1%  \n\nSo this isn't necessarily my favorite application of this flavor, but you can get a good idea of what it's doing to the mix with this recipe. What it really does here is harmonize the melons, bring that creamy body you're looking for with cream-style flavorings, and tame some of the throat you get from the melons.  \n\n**Bonus Recipe: Sweet Strawberry Cream**  \n*Ratio: 20PG/80VG*  \n*Steep: 3+ days*  \n\n* TFA Strawberry Ripe @ 3%  \n* FA Red Touch @ 0.5%  \n* INW Shisha Strawberry @ 2%  \n* TFA Vanilla Bean Ice Cream @ 3%  \n* INW Shisha Vanilla @ 1%  \n* LA Cream Cheese Icing @ 1%  \n* FLV Cream @ 1%  \n\nThis is where I fell in love with this flavoring =) Although you get a nice bit of creaminess and body from the other non-strawberry flavorings, FLV Cream harmonizes them all together in to a fantastic, well-rounded cream. It tames the VBIC and CCI, adds some depth to them, and blends the vanillas in to the cream base. \n\n",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Cream and Cookies @ 1% and 1 drop per 10ml, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 12 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Flavorah pitches this as a cookies and cream ice cream, but not I'm not getting much in the way of ice cream here. Tastes a whole lot like a less rich version of the non-dairy hydrogenated shortening type filling in oreos, with that chocolate-esque oreo kind of cookie taste.  No real richness or dairy in there to truly come across as an ice cream though.  Reasonably accurate flavor overall, but I'm missing mouthfeel. Not the ultra-concentrated kind of Flavorah, suggested usage between 1.5 and 3%.\n\nInhale has that dry, semi-sweet kind of oreo chocolate taste higher up.  Moderately dense, without a lot of thicker body, but a bit of a hollow ice cream taste down low.  Exhale has that same, fairly accurate oreo chocolate cookie / animal cracker type of flavor up front. Flavor is okay, but there's no real grainy texture there. Back of the exhale has some of that creme taste.  Again, taste is fairly accurate, but I'm not getting much mouthfeel or accurate fattyness to it.  Lingering higher slightly flat cocoa notes.\n \n**Off-flavors:** Balance is an issue depending on percentage, but nothing that shouldn't be there.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Nah. \n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  A fairly distinctive flavor that's going to need some help to get where it's going. To go full oreo, you'll probably need a crispier bakery like INW/JF Biscuit or FA Cookie to get some grain back into that cookie. Then you'll probably need a richer, thicker frosting concentrate to fill in creme note like FLV Frosting or maybe one of the whipped creams.\n\nThe lack of texture is probably an asset in something like a Cookies and Cream Ice Cream flavor.  Using this at 2% and above, then adding your ice cream base of choice will probably get you in the ballpark.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, I don't get a whole lot out of this at .25% and .5%.  A trace of a chocolate flavor, and a flat frosting note.  !% has slightly more definition, but still kind of tastes like oreo cookie ice milk, all homogeneous and lacking richness. 1.5% is better, you can start picking out some discrete cookie and frosting flavors but it's still on the light side.  2% is pretty linear with 1.5%, same kind of vibe, just a bit fuller flavor, still lacking richness. 3% has a pretty defined cookie flavor, if not texture. Chocolate here is reading as distinctly oreo, and you get full creme flavor without the body I'd expect.  At 4% that chocolate seems a bit blown out and weird, and there is still the same lack of body.  I'd recommend starting with this at 1.5% as an accent and going up to 2.5% or 3% as a primary flavor.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nI can't find much.\n\n[Heres the Flavorah product page.  Their description: \"Cream and cookies is a milky, ice cream with black oreo and white fudge filling. Can be fortified with other dairy flavors or used selectively as a base.

The menthol note is very smooth here and not overpowering in anyway. I get a slight hint of chocolate from it, but it's very mellow. The texture is slightly crisp and full. The mint is not super forward, and the chocolatey-creaminess of this makes me feel it would work well in a base or toward the middle range of a receipe.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Cucumber @ 1% and 1 drop per 10ml (about .25%), 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 9 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  First, shoutout to /u/Zermacht/, because my review of this is pretty heavily colored by their review of [RF Cucumber.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/65erin/rf_cucumber_bigger_than_yours/)  I get a sweet and slightly dry, peel-heavy version of cucumber with a bit of a salty tinge. Less astringent and green than FA Cucumber, but not nearly as juicy as CAP Cucumber. If you've made tzatziki sauce and done the thing where you salt the cucumber and press it to get some of the water out... this kind of tastes like that.  \n\nInhale is salty and a bit sharp, with a higher realistic cucumber top note. On the lighter side, with a pretty solid and slightly out-of-place sweetness.  Exhale has that same slightly salty cucumber taste up front. Not a really strong flavor, sort of like a grassy honeydew with a bit of salt. Higher peel notes, fairly strong but not overpowering and very realistic tasting. Sweet but lighter mouthfeel.  Sweetness is a bit hard to describe, but it's definitely a greener vegetal sweetness.  That sweetness is, for me at least, a bit offputting at higher percentages. Exhale is fairly clean, but I get some lingering artificial-tasting cucumber flavor.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Good amount of skin on this.  It's definitely cucumber skin, so it's not \"off\"... but it's skin-heavy nonetheless.  Again, hat tip to u/zermacht/, I'm getting some saltiness that seems to up the dryness a bit.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Nah, not really.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Standard cucumber pairings are melons, citrus, and mints. Basically anything \"refreshing.\"\n\nCucumbers add some freshness to brighter flavors like strawberry.\n\nThe vegetal part of this works well to soften up a stronger basil flavor like FLV Basil or FA Zen Garden.\n\nWorks well in cocktail recipes, especially with gin. The relative dryness of this makes CAP Cucumber a better choice if you're mostly after juiciness.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, at .25% this seems a bit too light. Some bright cucumber top notes, but no real body to it.  Some raw VG here. .5% has bit of dryer body and stronger top notes, but still not quite a full cucumber flavor. 1% starts to fill out substantially. Top notes are like freshly sliced cucumber, although the body is a little flat and fairly dry for a cucumber.  1.5% has a sweet green body and pronounced peel notes.  At 2%, the sweetness here doesn't really sit right with me.  The flavor is full but not really crisp, so it gets pretty weird. I'd recommend starting with this at 1% and working up.\n\nSeems like it'll be more useful for the top notes than anything else. Lacking some of the juicier cucumber body that I want.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nNah, not really.\n\n[Heres the Flavorah product page.  Their description: \"A fresh and innovative flavor profile that vapes like a happy hours cocktail. Don’t bother turning up your pinky finger when you burn this…it’s not a light airy essence, it’s a good fresh and full hitting vegetal vape. Delightful with a cooling menthol, or can be happily blended with some fruits for a very condescending and upscale juice from the top shelf. Capital!\"  Apparently this turns you into a bit of a dick, so caveat emptor.](http://store.flavorah.com/concentrated-cucumber-flavor)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Custard @ 1% and 1 drop per 10ml, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 10 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** A medium bodied custard, without the vanilla that you'd usually look for. Relatively subtle flavor, but fairly eggy and rich tasting, without a lot of the weight you'd expect.  Little bit of spice to this, more of a cinnamon mouthfeel, as opposed to a clear taste. A bit weak for flavorah, doesn't really show up until 2% and usable up to about 5%.  [Flavorah put up a GCMS sheet for this, and it apparently has no DAAP, so that explains some of the lack of weight.](http://www.flavorah.com/wp-content/uploads/safety/flavorah_custard_gcms.pdf)  The optimistic view is that is a pretty good custard for being diketone free, the less optimistic view is that it's a bit too thin to really scratch that custard itch.\n\nInhale is fairly airy and subtle up top. Some deeper eggy notes.  They say there's no vanilla in here, but there is a bit of floral spiciness that could be a darker vanilla flavor or maybe a cinnamon.  Exhale has some eggy custard richness up front, with that same kind of mystery light spice in the top notes. I'm going to assume it's cinnamon, because this specifically built to not have the vanilla... but it's close enough.  Flavor is relatively top heavy, with a thinner mouthfeel for a custard. Not a lot going on in the base of the flavor.  Lingering spice and a bit of flatness on the palate.\n\n**Off-flavors:** I get some cinnamon-like spiciness out of this, similar to the vague spicy note in FLV Cream. Steeps out a bit, but still noticeable as low as 1%.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Nothing really.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  It's a bit odd, seems useful for when you want a custard taste, without a bunch of weight.  I'm not 100% sure anyone really wants to go this route, but could be useful for making richer bakeries and creams that don't have a huge bottom end custard fullness.  Does have the advantage of not being particularly \"wet\" so maybe give this a shot if your bakeries are tasting a bit soggy with other flavors.  Might do a better job simulating a bavarian cream than a lot of \"Bavarian Cream\" flavors. Would let you keep a deeper, bready base and effectively layer your custard in the middle of the vape.\n\nThe flavor here is pretty good, so best use may be to fill in the top of a heavier custard base without putting too much weight on the lower end. Also good for getting a custard taste into fruit mixes, without dragging them into a full, heavy custard.\n\nMay have some use getting custard notes into tobaccos, without messing with mouthfeel all that much.\n\nAlso, if you have a thing against delicious diketones, this may fit the bill for you. No rancid dairy butryic kind of note to speak of, which is cool for a diketone free custard.\n\n**Notes:**  Seems a bit weak for Flavorah.  Really light and thin at .25% and .5%.  Flavor starting to show up at 1%. and it's nice, but it still on the thin side.  Not a lot of body. 1.5% is largely the same, good flavor still a bit light. 2% is starting to come together a bit, with some noticeable weight to it.  3% is better, still not heavy but the flavor is approaching good and saturated, worth noting this seems to have a light spice to it unsteeped, dies down a bit after steeping, but I pick up just a bit on cinnamon warmth. 4% have a bit more body still, but nothing too deep. More like a weight in the middle of the vape, as opposed to the low end. Flavor has quite a bit of spice at 4%.  5% doesn't have any more weight, but it's getting drier and moving away from those eggy notes.  6% is too dry and spicy for me.  I'd recommend starting with this at 2% as an accent and working up.  I'm not getting enough full flavor from this really use it as a primary note, and not enough weight for recommending it as an additive at lower percentages.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nNot really.  Lots of info on FLV Vanilla Custard, but the two aren't really comparable. Vanilla Custard is a more traditional custard flavor, Diacetyl and all.\n\n[Heres the Flavorah product page.  Their description: \"Sans vanilla, this custard is the eggy cream. You might get lost without the vanilla notes, but if a plain custard is needed it can be a very useful tool. Not likely to be your standalone shake and vape, but when you use custard as a base note to add depth, and don't need the dominant effects of the vanilla, then this is a better option.\"](http://store.flavorah.com/concentrated-custard-flavor)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Dragon Fruit @ 3%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 7 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Dead on for the hibiscus infusion flavor you find in teas.  Light, floral, and pleasant.  Reminds me of rose hips, not 100% on the flavor but the way the taste actually works.\n\nThin and soft sweetness on the inhale. Floral exhale with a more pronounced sweetness.  Still relatively thin for how saturated this flavor is.  Doesn't quite cross the line into overtly perfumey. Distinct hibiscus tea type of flavor.  Exhale is really clean, with very little lingering on the palate except a slight bitterness.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Very slightly bitter.  Sweetness is short-lived, and it tends to have a light sucralose edge left over.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Light throat hit. A bit thin and a slightly bitter sting.  Nothing crazy, but I definitely feel this with prolonged vaping. \n\n**Uses:** Green Tea.  It should work a lot like Jasmine in that kind of mix.  It could be used as an exotic replacement for citrus in fruit blends. It's relatively thin and occupies the same space on the palate.  It would also make a decent sub for TFA Honeysuckle if you find that too sweet or aggressive.  Would shine in floral mixes for added complexity without turning everything into a perfumey mess.\n\n**Pairings:** FE or TFA Green Tea. Bright, non-floral fruits like strawberry or richer apples like FA/JF Fuji or FA Kiwi.  Sweetness will get a bit aggressive in this application, so temper it back down with some Cream or INW Cactus. Someone suggested pairing CAP Hibiscus with CAP Blue Raspberry Cotton Candy, and I think this would work better than the CAP Hibiscus there. Should work to bolster FA Rose into something truly special.  Too floral for really heavy thick creams, I'd keep it relatively light like FA Fresh Cream or FLV Cream. Along the same lines, TFA Vanilla Swirl. Coconut would be great, for cream without dairy notes for this to clash with.  Brings out some top notes in juicier pineapples like CAP Golden Pineapple or FLV Pineapple.\n\n**Notes:** I can't really comment on authenticity here, as all of my dragonfruit experience has been with a really abstracted commercial flavor added to fruit blends.  This nails that.  Less body than INW Dragon Fruit, although a more subtle take on the same kind of taste. More subtle and less chemical than TFA Dragon Fruit but without those magical emulsifying properties.\n\nI wouldn't use this as a primary note in a mix.  It doesn't have the body to be a star.  As a component, 3% definitely isn't overbearing.  Seems to drop off substantially undeneath that.  I'd go with a mix at 1% for a slight floral hint. 2%-3% seems to be sweet spot for a recognizable flavor.\n\nOverall, not a great full fruit, but an outstanding floral accent. \n\nShoutout to /u/apexified for sending this my way for review.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nAlmost nothing.\n\n[No real info but a couple of five star reviews on diy-ejuice.com](http://www.diy-ejuice.com/Dragon-Fruit-by-Flavorah-p/flv-dragonfruit.htm)\n\n[One 3-star review calling it bizarre on BCF](http://www.bullcityflavors.com/dragon-fruit-flv/)\n\n[ELR Flavor notes take about the flavor fading](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/65008)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Donuts @ 1% and 1 drop per 10 ml (about .25%), 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 16 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** So, right off the bat this isn't everyone's cup of tea. Check the second opinions.\n\nI get a deep, sweet, doughy bread flavor with a bit of yeast.  More like a vaguely sweet dinner roll fresh from the oven.  Dense, warm, and a bit waxy mouthfeel.  Maybe a light fried note here, but it's fairly subtle as far as these things go. Solo, not really a great donut, but should work well with a cakier concentrate like Yellow Cake, or FA Zeppola to build a dense, yeast-risen donut flavor.  On the ridiculously potent side, so start really low (like 1 drop per 30ml) and work up to maybe .3-.4%.\n\nInhale is sweet and warm, seriously like inhaling the burst of air from the oven when you pull out dinner rolls but with a kind of odd sharp powdered sugar note. Dense.  I don't find the sweetness here cloying, but it's definitely pushing the limits for a bready flavor.  Exhale has a dense, sweet yeast-risen dough kind of taste. No crispiness to speak off, so it really does come across more like dough than a donut.  I get some light yeasty notes up top, with a drier, slightly powdery sugar. Sweetness in the base is separate, and feels very much baked in as opposed to dumped over the top of a dough base.  Small bit of a yeasty sourness in there, but not too aggressive at .25%. Clean finish overall, with just a tiny bit of a bitter tinge.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Well, I don't get anything in the way of play-dough out of this, which is positive for a donut. A bit waxy though, and the sweet note is just a bit sharp, almost like powdered sugar.  At higher concentrations, people report a stale beer kind of taste.  At lower percentages, I get just a slight hit of sourness overall, but I think it complements the body and the sweetness pretty well.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Inhale is just a bit sharper than you'd expect, but no harshness on the exhale.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This is not a solo donut flavor.  It's more like a fresh, warm sweet dough additive than anything else. This has very little in the way of a crisp or grainy texture, and as such is going to need to some work to make it really read as a finished bakery product.  I'd use this low, and then bring in your AP or AP substitute flavor to give this some drier bakery volume to hang onto.  It's hard to escape the comparison, but use is a lot like FA Joy.\n\n**Notes:**  For the love of god, start low. This is going to dominate a mix if you use any kind of a heavy hand. Seriously, either make a dilution or start at 1 drop per 30ml and work up. I get a nice clear, relatively clean sweet dough from this at .25%, and by .5% it's starting to get a bit heavy and sour.  1% isn't a good time, that sourness is starting to come across pretty clearly.\n\nThis is basically in the same family as FA Joy. I think this is a little less oily, sugary, and sour.  It's also fairly close, at least in function to FLV Sweet Dough and FLV Fried Dough. I definitely get less oil and yeast from this than Fried Dough, and I think this is fuller and sweeter than Sweet Dough but with maybe a touch more yeast, reading more like dough than the sweet dough for all that sense that makes.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[So this right here merits the disclaimer on the top of the review. /u/MrBurgundy314, in a FOTW for Doughnut reports:](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/5y00cs/you_donut_want_to_glaze_over_this_flavor_of_the/)\n\n\"FLV Donut is the most vile flavor I've ever tasted. One drop in 30ml will ruin your mix. It's gross. Absolutely fucking disgusting. It isn't \"fried\" flavor. It isn't beer. It's like a fucking yeast-infected belly button. It's. Fucking. Disgusting.\"\n\nI'm obviously a bit more positive on this, but it's worth noting that if you aren't into FA Joy, you should probably steer well clear of this.\n\n[In the same FOTW, /u/chewymidget states:](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/5y00cs/you_donut_want_to_glaze_over_this_flavor_of_the/)\n\n\"If you do not like FA Joy do not buy this flavor!... It is concentrated. I didn't use more than .4% to start to really get a flavor from it. This isn't an actually full flavored fried donut. It's in the same realm as FA Joy without the funky wax or beer notes at low percentages. If you use too much of this stuff it will over take the entire mix and has a potential to start to get funky. This is were it would have potential to start to taste of stale beer. You would use this to bring out a fried pastry flavor.\"\n\n[This one actually has one star on ELR, but it's based on a note posted by, what I can only assume is the same Burgundy as the previous mention.  I actually really like their notes here:](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/110471)\n\n\"A little too yeasty for me. It isn't at all play dough like CAP, but it's almost sour. Honestly, it reminds me of a few attempts I, and others, have made utilizing Joy, Meringue, and maybe something else. Very similar to Joy. This one is super potent. 0.25% is more than enough for single flavor, although I don't recommend it as a single flavor. Give it grain with the likes of Cheesecake (Graham Crust), Meringue, Sugar Cookie, or something else along those lines and it's more palatable. It isn't even close to the donut I was hoping for. Bummer!\"\n\n[And here is the FLV product page. Their description: \"Strong fried cake donut flavor, can be used at a very low percentage for effect. At higher percentage it will overwhelm more subtle bakery notes and base flavors.\"  I think you'd kind of need some texture to call this a cake donut flavor, and I definitely get some yeast in here. At least they tell you to mix low.  Although the recommended usage on their safety sheet is 1-5%.  You definitely shouldn't do that.](http://store.flavorah.com/concentrated-donuts-flavor)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**\n\n*META: So, I've made the orders from the list generated by y'all on [this post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/67e7cz/tell_me_what_to_review_a_stunning_victory_and_the/)  The good news is that I fit pretty much everything specific on there, barring out of stocks.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Flavorah Eisai Tea, .25%, 1% and 3%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 12 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Slightly fruity, drier green tea.  Feels closer to a matcha than the other green teas I’ve tried.\n\nDistinct green tea flavor in here.  Tastes slightly earthy, but doesn’t seem to have much of that more tannic edge usually associated with steeped teas.  Tastes a little bit musky, but seems like a powdered green tea kind of musky without anything distinctly floral.  Not as bold as matcha in general, but definitely feels like it’s headed in that direction.  Even at higher percentages, the green tea is maybe a bit subtle with everything going on.\n\nLike the straight green tea, I’m picking up a bit of slightly minty cooling.  This seems to be less grassy than FLV Green Tea though, and I’m not necessarily getting that fresher vegetation flavor.  Instead of grassy I am getting something sort of fruity.  Nothing really specific, maybe a bit melon-y, but more just a generic fruity sweetness.  Not overwhelming or candied, but sweeter than I’d expect for a straight tea.\n\nTexturally, again, this feels like it’s leaning toward matcha.  It doesn’t quite have that warmer, thinner tea mouthfeel that the other flavorah teas have had. This is maybe a bit creamier, and can take on some that authentic matcha powdery texture.  Moderately dense overall.\n\nOf the new Flavorah green teas, this one reads more matcha-ish while FLV Green Tea seems to be the normal steeped leaves variety.\n\n**Off-Flavors:**  Generic melon fruitiness.  Actual tea flavor seems a bit too subtle for a matcha.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light to moderate.  Seems a bit throaty.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At .25%,  this tastes a bit indistinct for me.  Light green tea, light vague sweeteness.  Doesn’t have much of a texture to it.\n\nAt 1%,  I get a clearer matcha green tea.  That corresponding fruitiness has also kicked up a bit.  Mouthfeel is a little thicker and more substantial.\n\nAt 3%,  this is getting a bit odd.  Green tea doesn’t seem that much stronger than 1% and it definitely tastes a bit fruitier. Slightly powdery, moderate dense mouthfeel.  Starting to get something that tastes a little fresh and green\n\nJust based on these tests, I’d probably be using this flavor between 1 and 2% for a green tea accent.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Not a “perfect” matcha, but definitely a whole lot closer for me than other green teas.\n\nThis is probably my pick for a non “cup of tea” type green tea.  This is the green tea I’d use with creams, bakeries, or anything beyond straight fruit you’d want some green tea in.\n\n Being less floral and less tannic than the other options is going to let you take this in some interesting directions.  I could see this working working really well in ice creams or beverages that have a cream component.\n\nIt’s also the green tea I’d use in candy applications. \n\nOr , if you’re a complete lunatic and are thinking about a tobacco pairing, I’d pick this one.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  [There’s an ELR page up, with some familiar names and some very positive day 1 pre-release type reviews.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/234672)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Close to how I'd want a fig concentrate to taste, after trying the brighter, fruitier varieties from CAP and FA.  Has some of the same sweetness and body that I get from something like cooked mission figs.  A deep sweetness, useful for accentuing dryer, nuttier flavors or adding depth to something jammy as opposed to juicy.\n\nInhale is a bit spicy and sharp. Moderate density and a lighter deep sweetness. Dense exhale with a dark fruit sweetness. Not quite raisin-y but the dark, dry sweetness is similar, almost like a date. Earthy, musky top notes with a bit of a non-peppery spice to it.  So I guess it's more cologne-y than perfume-y.  Sweet without being bright or juicy.

A little musky, but not like a sharp floral perfume.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Good fruit flavor to stand up to funkier creamy flavors like yogurts and cheesecakes.  The dark sweetness here should actually work well with cheesier concentrates in general.  This may be a good foil to FLV Brie Cheese.\n\nI'd use this more as an additive in fruit mixes than as a discrete flavor. Adding a low percentage to something jammy or dark berries is going to help sell some real depth to a mix.\n\nGood fig to use with tobacco pairings. I've only tried FA Fig and CAP Fig but both of those are way too fruity to really work with tobaccos. This has a dark sweetness, without any kind of super bright fruity notes. Should do a good job replicating some of the raisiny notes you get in certain tobaccos. Tastes like the fruitier note from the basic blue american spirits to me.\n\nThis has an earthy depth and a bit of funk, should work to punch up darker, fruiter liquor flavors especially brandy.  Could even work to round out a red wine sangria flavor.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nS&V concentration testing, this is fairly strong.  Pretty present at .25%.  I'm getting some raw vg out of this, but it's still fairly sweet and musky. By .5%, it's a clear flavor, with the dark fruit starting to fill in a bit. At .75%, I'm starting to notice the earthiness quite a bit more. Not a peel note, but just some deep funk to the concentrate. At 1%, the musk part of this is getting a little sharp and you can taste it starting to get perfumey. Still balanced enough, but the seams on the flavor are starting to show quite a bit.  2% is really overpowering.  That musky fig is getting fairly perfumey and I'm picking up some wet flowers and an ammonia-like cat piss thing. Don't use this at 2%.  I'd start with this low. I'm really thinking that most of the useful range of this is going to be sub 1%.  Maybe start at .25% as an additive in fruit mixes, .5% in tobaccos, and .75% if you're trying to pair it up with one of those stronger, weirder creamy flavors.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nNot a ton, although /u/Cheebasteeba/ seems to be a fan.  [In a thread on tobacco sweetness, they state:](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/5gqhzc/tobacco_sweetness/)\n\n \"Fig makes for a great sort of sweet musty fruity note in tobaccos. I would recommend either FLV Fig or Delosi Fig for a good fig; FA's is a bit too bright, CAP's doesn't quite hit the right notes, and FLV Sweet Fig isn't much different than the regular fig (slightly lighter and slightly sweeter). \"\n\n[Later, in another tobacco post cheeba and /u/T_Mace go back and forth on FLV Fig as a potential tobacco additive.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/56vxxm/reasons_why_the_most_recent_modest_monday_does/) Cheeba's initial impression:  \"3% is too high, a little harsh here and strong flavor. Kind of like a dark spicy mustiness. Faint sweetness on the tongue. Decent body.\"  Cheeba then comes back with \" I also think a good starting range for these would be 1-1.5% in a tobacco mix, maybe even a little lower.\" and T_Mace is leaning towards .5-.75%.\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Fire Cinnamon @ 1% and 1 drop per 10 ml (about .25%), 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 6 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Just the spicy part of the cinnamon.  Light, neutral body without the heavy, powdery bakery cinnamon note of FLV Rich Cinnamon.  Closer to the cinnamon note from a stick of Big Red gum, but no weird sourness or anything else off putting.  A bit of dryness in the top notes, but nothing that comes across as chalky.  Useful mostly where you want a spicy kick from cinnamon, but don't want to deal with a candy base or a more powdery bakery cinnamon. Linear flavor, fairly present at 1%, but still tolerable up at 2-2.5%.\n\nNot a ton going on here, which is probably a good thing. Inhale has spicy cinnamon top notes. Tastes like a very \"red\" version of cinnamon, for lack of a better term. Light, but still present neutral body. Just heavy enough it doesn't come across as thin or astringent. No real sweetness here, but it isn't distractingly bitter either.  Exhale can get slightly dry and is definitely warm. Mostly just top notes of cinnamon spice. I don't get heavy or bakery-esque to the cinnamon. Still has a very neutral body.  Seems pretty well designed to just sit in the top notes of a mix without messing with your base at all.  Clean finish overall. Maybe just a hint of lingering cinnamon spice.\n\nFlavor blindness on stronger spices is an issue for me, and as the cinnamon kind of fades out a bit, I get a really neutral but still spicy body. Doesn't turn thin and sour like some other spice flavors.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Nah, just the spicy part of cinnamon.  Nothing that doesn't belong.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Definitely a spicy flavor, with some solid heat to it. No real chemical or harsh throat hit, but you can definitely feel it. I think that's kind of the point though.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  It's a good commercial / candy cinnamon where you don't want the dryer, richer FLV Rich Cinnamon and no overwhelming candy quality.\n\nI'd look at this for a mulled cinnamon flavor in warmer beverages, where you don't necessarily want the body of bakery cinnamon and more just a hint of spice.  I think Flavorah is slightly off on the fireball whisky thing, just because that stuff is disgustingly sweet as is.  I do think it's a good option for cocktail vapes though, for adding a cinnamon note that will work well with a lighter cocktail body.\n\nI think it would also be useful in building your own cinnamon candy recipes, letting you have control of the spice level separately from the sweetness.\n\nAlso a good option when you just want to dump that cinnamon flavor on top of a fruit mix without dragging it full onto into a full on pie filling.\n\n**Notes:**  Surprisingly enough, not crazy strong and pretty much linear. No flavored body here, so it really is just how much cinnamon spice you want. Noticeable but light at .25% and .5%. Nothing too spicy, but a general warmth without a lot of clear cinnamon spice flavor.  At 1%, I get a clearer red candy cinnamon flavor, but out the red hots sweet body.  Spice and warmth level is ramping up a bit, but it's not overwhelming at all. 1.5% is like 1%, just more.  A little dryer, a little spicier. Still pretty pleasant. 2% is pretty spicy.  I get some dryness, but nothing crazy.  Still a neutral body overall.  2.5% is spicier still, pushing my usable limit for the flavor. 3% is getting a bit dryer for me, and it's unpleasantly spicy.  I think if you're absolutely bent on crazy levels of cinnamon spice, this concentrate is a good choice. It dries out a bit as you crank up the percentage, but there is no real weird off notes or chemical tastes. Personally, I'd top out around 2.5%, but 1% is probably my sweet spot.\n\nFWIW, I'll be covering FLV Red Cinnamon tomorrow, to see where that fits in the grand scheme of the the Flavorah cinnamon flavors.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nNot really.\n\n[And here is the FLV product page.

At .2% it is nice and pleasant, slightly sweet but I didn't know this when I first got the flavor and did a sft at 1% and it almost went in the trash right then and there.

I recommend making a 10% dilution of this flavor and mixing with that. \n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nThere aren't really any notes on this flavor, I just see that everyone is using it above 1%.

At lower wattages there are butter-cream type frosting notes you'd get on a mid-grade wedding cake.

Lorann's Cream Cheese Icing is my closest competitor, but this has a much clearer vanilla note and I like the added volume here.  It's almost a really good marshmallow flavor.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Ginger @ 1% and 1 drop per 10ml, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 10 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Fancy ginger ale syrup. Some spicier ginger top notes, but a thick, sweet, slightly syrupy base.  Close to something like [Reed's Extra Ginger](http://reedsinc.com/product/reeds-extra-ginger-brew/) which has a good amount of sweetness, but a solid ginger hit.  Seems a bit complex for a straight ginger flavor, but anything extra here works really well.  Not spooky strong, use at around .5% for an accent or up to 1.5% for a main ginger flavor.\n\nInhale is sweet, with spicier ginger top notes. Moderately dense, which is nice for a flavor that can come across as one-dimensional.  Exhale is ginger forward. Slightly spicy but not overwhelming or sharp top notes.  Sweet base, bordering on syrupy. As the exhale tails off, I get a lighter, brighter slightly bitter note a lot like lime zest.  Some lingering slighter bitter spice notes, like mulled cloves.  Still relatively full bodied and a bit of juicy mouthfeel.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  I get some complexity here beyond straight ginger. Almost tastes like a really subtle lime zest and clove note in here.  Definitely not bad, but tastes like a ginger ale.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light. Ginger is a bit aggressive, but no real throat hit beyond what you'd expect.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Good base for ginger candies.  Sweeter, deeper ginger flavor to complement the spicier top notes. Should be pretty easy to take in hard candy or crystallized ginger direction.\n\nReally good ginger for beverage applications. Mix with rum and lime for a pretty decent dark and stormy (thanks flavorah blurb writer), or take it full on ginger ale.  Also a good candidate for mixing with teas.\n\nNot really a dry bakery spice, so probably not the best choice for gingerbreads or bakeries with a spice component.\n\nWith fruit mixes, ginger should pair well apple, cherries, brighter citrus, and cranberries.\n\nMight also be a good choice for blending with creams and custards, if a ginger cream is your thing.\n  \n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, .25% has some noticeable ginger.  It's mostly in the top notes, and you're mostly getting a hit of brighter ginger. A bit dry down this low.  .5% brings in some more sweetness and body. Doesn't seem all that much spicier, but quite a bit sweeter and fuller.  Still a tad on the dry side, but not powdery like the usual holiday-spice version.  1% has quite a bit of sweetness, again not a lot of bump up in spiciness, but there's a deeper, syrupy base here.  1.5% is getting heavy and syrupy, spice level is still pretty similar but you're getting a lot more body here. 2% seems a bit blown out and muted to me.  I'd recommend using this as an accent at .5% and 1-1.5% as a stronger primary flavor.\n\nSeems fairly close to [HS Ginger](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/5sb5es/hs_ginger/) but more syrupy and further from that dry ginger spice note.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[One note on ELR, by user \"daxbender\": \"tested it at 1% and it tastes like fresh grated/chopped ginger, at 1.5% was sweeter and reminded me more of a crystallized ginger.\"](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/121201)\n\n[Heres the Flavorah product page.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Ginger Peach @ 1% and 1 drop per 10 ml (about .25%), 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 15 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Sweet cream soda body with some subtle peach and a bit of spicier ginger on the backend. The peach here is crazy soft, more of a sweet background than a primary flavor. Ginger is relatively subtle, but you get it pretty clearly on the back end. The body is super interesting, it's sweet and full, but really soft and I'd swear I'm getting a bit of vanilla toward the backend with the ginger. Softer flavor overall, I'd use primarily for beverage vapes and maybe a sweetener for fruit mixes. Pretty concentrated, use low and work up.\n\nInhale has a bit of sharp ginger in the top notes and a warm, heavily sweet base with just a bit of light, soft peach flavor with no real floral component.  Kind of like a white peach, where it's lacking the really heavy identifiable peach flavor, and instead is a peach tinged sweetness. Moderately dense, and that sweetness tastes realistic, without any kind of chemical edge. Exhale is soft, warm, and dense. Almost has an herbal tea kind of quality, where there's a definite volume, but no real sharper artificial peach taste.  Some light, spicy ginger in the top notes, but it's really subtle until you hit the tail of the exhale and it starts to build a bit. Same kind of heavily sweet sort of peachy base to the exhale.  No real clear taste of vanilla, but It really reminds me of the really soft, sweet vanilla that you get a cream soda with the same kind of sugary, dense mouthfeel. \n\n**Off-flavors:**  So nothing offensive here, but it's a bit weird overall. I don't get a super clear peach, and there is a cream soda type of sweet body to it.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Not really, which is pretty cool for both peach and ginger.  Both of those can get a bit harsh, but I get no real throat hit out of this. Some spice from the ginger in there, but nothing like a normal throat hit.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This is a pretty mellow flavor, but like most of the flavorah it should sit pretty front and center in a mix. I'd use this as a primary note, and build around it.\n\nI'm pretty instantly thinking about a bubble tea / boba kind of mix. I think the softer peach, and that cream soda body is going to mix really well with some lighter milk/cream flavors and maybe some of that FE Green Tea.\n\nAlso seems like a good candidate for other beverage mixes, like lemonades and black teas.\n\nShould also work with florals, which are finally kind of a thing again.\n\nThis is a bit warm and wet for pairing with heavier creams and custards or bakeries, I'd probably avoid it.\n\nThis has a good natural-tasting sweetness, this may have some use as a sweetener with a dense mouthfeel in fruit mixes. The ginger isn't overbearing at all, and should work really well with other peaches, plums, apples, and pears.\n  \n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, this is really interesting.  It's a soft flavor overall, but it definitely isn't weak.  I get the full flavor of the concentrate at .25%.  It's actually a bit dryer down low, and that cream soda edge has almost a marshmallow dryness to it. The ginger also stands out quite a bit down here. Still light on the peach flavor, but it's present.  .5% is mostly sweeter, wetter, and denser. It seems to be muting itself just a bit, but the mouthfeel and sweetness is definitely ramping up. 1% is even denser and sweeter, with a softer ginger flavor but more of that cream soda body.  1.5% is starting to get a bit too moist for me, and I'm losing some of the nuance of the flavor. Definitely sweet though. 2% is mostly warm sweetness.  I'd start low at around .25-.5% and work up until you get the mouthfeel you're after.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nNot a one, seriously.\n\n[Not even a description on the flavorah product page.](http://store.flavorah.com/concentrated-ginger-peach-flavor)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

    "markdown": "*This a a pre-release flavor, which was provided to me solely for the purposes of review.*\n\n**Setup:** Recoil w/ flavor barrel, Dual 15 wrap 26g 3mm Nifethal 70 coils @.16 ohms.  60w power, 450F temp limit. Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Graham Cracker, .25, 1, and 3%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 7 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  More fluffy than crisp, not a ton of texture here but I'm getting a lot of volume.  Overall seems like a relatively light flavor.  A little top heavy and thin in the base.\n\nOnce you get to actual graham flavor here at higher percentages, it's okay.  More of a lighter graham flour kind of taste without too much darker honey sweetness behind it.  Missing some of the carmelized-ish sugar taste I associate with graham crackers.\n\nI'm not picking up a cinnamon spice note in here.  In terms of graham crackers, it definitely steers closer to a straight up graham cracker, and not the cinnamon kind.  It does seem like there's some kind of bakery vanilla in here. Still seems like fairly subtle, but it's like someone used a heavy hand with vanilla extract before baking these off.  At high percentages it can pick up a bit of an icing type note, but that's pushing 5%.\n\n**Off-flavors:** On the whole, doesn't really jump out as a graham cracker.  Nothing offensive or bad, but it seems to be lacking some texture and depth.  I don't think the vanilla is completely out of line, but there isn't a ton going on around it so it sticks out.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Little bit of throatiness here and a bit of dryness. Nothing major, but it does seem to have just a little bite.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At .25% there's a lot of texture, and not much flavor.  Definitely needs more flavor here to come through clearly.\n\nAt 1% still feels a little light for a graham cracker. Some graham cracker top notes coming through but it still feels soft. Vanilla is starting to show up as an accent, not unpleasant but high for a graham cracker.\n\nAt 3% there's some texture here, but it feels powdery instead of crispy.  Graham flour top notes are clearer.  Vanilla is stronger but it hasn't crossed into full on icing territory yet.  Still tastes light, I'm missing the honey if this supposed to be a honey graham cracker.  Actually feels maybe a little undersweet.\n\nI'd probably mix with this around 2% when I'm after more of the graham cracker top notes and not a full graham cracker, probably pairing with a heavier base.  If I was going to try to force some texture in here I may go up to 3-4%, but the mix will have to accommodate the vanilla.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Comparing this other graham crackers, it definitely doesn't have much in common with CAP Graham Cracker. The CAP has a pretty solid cinnamon hit to it, and a crisper, heavier texture.   This is also less buttery and textured than the TPA version.  Seems to resemble a fluffier version of FW more than any of the others. Maybe a bit lighter in flavor and with less texture.  I do get a bit of plasticy-vanilla note out of the FW, but the vanilla in the FLV seems a bit less weird to me.  Personally, the Capella version tastes the most like an actual graham cracker to me, but I kind of like the cinnamon note in there. If you're anti-cinnamon, this may be worth a shot if you're after a lighter  graham cracker without the butter of TPA and FW has that same weirdness to you.\n\nIn terms of filling this out, I could see some trying to bring in some texture.  It would work well to dial back CAP Graham Cracker a bit and for a lighter graham cracker.  If you have something working as a bit of emulsification in a mix, like TPA Dragonfruit or FLV Cream, should work with a heavier AP note from something like Cookie for a deeper graham flavor or INW Biscuit for some buttery snap.  Flavorah bakeries tend to have less texture and usually require a bit of extra help to get crisper and more up-front.\n\nI can't come up with too many use cases where this is going to be hands-down the right graham cracker for a specific profile.  The top notes here might do a better job of showing up over heavier creamy bases, but generally those graham base flavors actually work really well with creams. I'd see it more as another option if you've got an issue with existing graham flavors, knowing it's a bit lighter and fluffier.\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

First part of the exhale is a pretty legitimate granny smith apple, but the inhale is a bit of a mess and the tail end of the exhale borders on straight unpleasant.  I'd relegate this accent duty, using it under .5% to add some realism and crispness to juicier, full apple or pear base.\n\nInhale is sharp and acidic with a sweeter but slightly dry green apple candy base. Moderately dense, with some top end bitterness and grassiness.  Beginning of the exhale is promising, with some crisper green apple peel notes and a even a bit of a denser, sweet fleshy texture. Back half of the exhale is pretty rough. Those top notes get bitter, astringent, and sharp and dominate the sweeter, dense candy apple base.  Bitterness really sticks on the top of your palate, and I'm getting a pretty prominent throat hit. Lingering bitterness and sticky, sugary mouthfeel.\n\n**Off-flavors:** This has a lot of that grassy, green apple acetone kind of taste. It dominates the back end of the exhale and you get a lingering bitterness.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  I get a pretty healthy throat hit from this.  It's definitely on the harsh side.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This is rough enough that I think it's pretty well relegated to a supporting player at low percentages.  I wouldn't want to try to turn this into a full apple flavor, I'd rather use this to accent a juicier apple concentrate.  Would work to sell a bartlett pear as well.  This definitely needs a fuller, juicier base to work from.\n  \n**Notes:**  .25% is bright, tart bordering on sour, and a bit crisp.  Not a lot of body to the concentrate down here, but a crisper texture and taste. .5% adds some sweetness to the back end, although it doesn't really taste like a full apple flavor.  Acetone notes are definitely present, but not completely overwhelming. 1% is sweeter and has a clearer apple taste and texture.  It's a good deal more bitter and harsh in the top notes.  1.5% is about as much sweetness as I want out of this.  Body is getting a bit dry for a fruit. Those off-flavors are still definitely in charge here.  2% is drier, even sweeter, and fairly astringent.  I don't think this is a good fit for a primary note. I'd recommend using .25-.5% pretty strictly as an additive to crisp up a fuller, flat, apple or pear based juice.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nI can't find anything relevant.\n\n[Heres the Flavorah product page.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Granola, .25, 1, and 3%, others noted, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 7 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Darker granola top note, with some light fruitiness.\n\nDarker cook on the granola. More of a darker, drier, homemade hippie-grade granola instead of a sticky, blonde, sweet commercial granola.  Toasted oat flavor, doesn't really feel like a cookie or cereal note.  Recognizably granola, if a bit dark.\n\nSweetness level fits in with that hippie-grade granola theme. Not particulary sweet.  I'm not picking up anything like honey, but there is a bit of a darker caramel effect on the sweetness here but that may just be bleeding through from the darker cook.\n\nThere's something fruity in here, feels like a moderate cherry note.  As you start to crank up percentage it picks up more of an almond edge to it although you still get a hit of that bright fruitiness.  I also pick up some darker bakery vanilla in here.\n\nI'm not finding much nuttiness here beyond that cherry / almond note at higher percentages.\n\nI'm picking up just a bit of a darker chocolate or cocoa note on the tail end of the exhale.  Not super prominent, but it really starts to show up as you increase percentage.\n\nTexture doesn't quite sell a crispy granola. Certainly tastes like granola, but the mouthfeel is a little soft and all of the granola is up top in the flavor.  Another bring your own AP flavorah bakery.  The mouthfeel is dry like a granola, but not really crispy.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  At lower percentages, not too bad. Cook is a bit aggressive. Texture feels the most off here.  At higher percentages I'm running into some bitterness and an almost chemical edge to that darker cooked note.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light, nothing major.  Feels more attached to that fruityness than anything else.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At .25%, I'm getting a pretty clear flavor. Medium dark roasted oats with some fruit presence if not a really defined fruit note.  A bit dry on mouthfeel, but not crispy.  Flavor seems a bit top heavy, and I'm not getting a heavier, warm, roasted kind of base.\n\nAt 1%, this feels quite a bit darker, like it's been cooked quite a bit longer. Darkness is just pushing the weird, burnt level to me. Fruitiness is a bit more defined, and I'm picking up some more clear red fruit along with a dark bakery vanilla note.  Also starting to pick up some of that cocoa. Still feels top heavy, a bit more of a base but it's subtle next to how aggressive that top note is coming across.\n\nAt 3%, this feels a fairly burnt. Too dark and a bit bitter. Cherries pushing toward almonds.  Still looking for some of that crunch and base.  Cocoa is more prominent up here.\n\nJust to test some separation, mixing this at .5% FLV Granola and 3% CAP Vanilla Whipped Cream, I am getting a clear layering in the flavor.  Doesn't taste crispy to me, but does give a clear granola topping vibe.\n\nJust based on these tests, I'd keep this relatively low, as an accent flavor for a granola top note. I'd probably mix between .25-.75%.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Since this ends up being a bit top heavy, should actually show up well layered with yogurts and creams.  I still think it needs a bit more texture, so maybe hitting with a bit of FA Cookie or CAP Cereal 27 would help make it taste a bit crispier in the mix.  It would also work well with some nuttiness, which would also scratch that AP itch.\n\nThe light fruitiness here shouldn't clash with any fruit flavors you wanted to bring in.\n\nOutside of just straight granola use, I could see this being used as an accent in a cookie recipe involving oatmeal.  I think this is probably a bit dark to use as a primary cookie note, but a smaller accent could help sell the \"oatiness\" of said cookie.\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Green Apple @ 1% and 1 drop per 10ml, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 8 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Tart and sweet green apple, leans a bit toward candy but not straight jolly ranchers. Dense apple body, with a fair amount of juiciness depending on percentage.  Moderately harsh and sharp.  Use at around .5% for an accent and closer to 2% for a primary flavor.\n\nInhale is a bit sharp and tart, with higher green, slightly acetone candy notes and a deeper juicy base.  Moderately dense, and on the sweet side. Exhale has green apple up front, somewhere between jolly ranchers and a crisper, tart realistic green apple. Top notes are a bit grassy, and have a touch of that same acetone off flavor. Sweeter full base.  Exhale feels a bit dryer and fuller than inhale, but I'm missing a bit of the juiciness that you get on the inhale. Flavor feels just a bit disjointed, like the more aggressive top notes aren't quite meshing into the base. Moderate amount of harshness.  Lingering sticky mouthfeel and some higher, astringent parts of the top notes.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Acetone and grassy notes in the top notes, but that seems pretty par for the course for green apples. At higher percentages, I'm getting a bit of a dairy funk in the base.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Pretty harsh as a S&V, seems to die down a bit with a steep.  Still ends up moderately harsh.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Pretty standard green apple flavor. Leans a bit toward candy, so it'll probably be good to mix with sweeter, fuller fruit flavors for a candy spin on a fruit mix.  If you want to keep a fruit mix brighter and fresher, use this a lower accent instead of a primary flavor.\n\nA bit sharp for cream mixes, but it can probably be done with a heavier cream or custard base.  This is going to push around lighter creams.\n\nGood, sharper accent for juicier apple flavors.\n  \n**Notes:**\n\nConcentration testing, .25% doesn't feel like a full flavor. Higher sour, tart notes come through pretty clearly but there isn't much of a base to it. .5% is actually pretty good, that base apple flavor is coming through a bit clearer. Not super aggressive and full down that low, but pretty well balanced.  1% is mostly sweeter than .5%, Tarter, sweeter, and those top notes are getting fairly aggressive.  1.5% is a bit rounder and sweeter than 1%. Tartness seems to be dying back down a bit, but i'm getting some clearer, sharp acetone and grassy flavors in the top notes. Sweetness is getting a bit juicy again.  2% is fuller, and juicier, but I'm getting some yogurt tang in there. 3% seems like too much on this flavor, getting a bit bitter and chemical.  Percentage recommendations are going to be based on how up front you want this flavor. Seems like it works as a pretty solid accent at .5%, and a fuller up front green apple with a candy edge at 1.75-2.25%.\n\nWill FLV Granny Smith be a crisp, realistic green apple? The suspense...\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[My only friend, the deleted user:](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/311eab/my_flv_tasting_notes_green_apple/)\n\n\"More apple juice than fresh apple. Subtle sour apple notes. Juicy — stimulates salivation (again - is that slight acidity??). A lot of ester-y fruitiness on the front of the tongue but not big in your face apple flavor. Well-balanced with no odd flavors.\n\nVery pretty with a drop of spearmint as a bright, simple ADV. Try as a carrier fruit flavor under more volatile fruit flavors. Try in delicate mixes. Try in ciders. Try with dry tobacco flavors.\"\n\n[ELR Page page is a little thin, but a couple useful notes on there.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/33045)\n\n[/u/skiddlzninja/ included some notes on recipe post in a FOTW for Apple:](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/3oi0dx/flavor_of_the_week_apple/)\n\n\"FLV Green Apple is more like the caramel apple lollipops that are handed out for Halloween, and seem to have a shelf-life that makes one feel uncomfortable just sharing the same spot in the universe as them. A delicious candy, and an unsettling anomaly. Nonetheless, it's a great tart candy-like apple flavor, and I'm using it here to gear Fuji closer towards a Granny Smith apple.\"\n\n[u/cannibalcastaway/ included a short note in a post of FLV tastings:](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/3qlxx6/a_few_flavorah_tasting_notes/)\n\n\"Green Apple - I had really high hopes for this, but since I am accustomed to the fantastic FA Fuji Apple, I shoudlnt be suprised that this didnt measure up.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Flavorah Green Tea, .25%, 1% and 3%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 12 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Steeped green tea, with a bit of mint.\n\nFairly mellow green tea flavor.  Light green tea earthiness here, but nothing really bitter or overdone.  Slightly tannic astringency, but seems to accurate to profile instead of something more aggressive like black tea or oversteeped.  Lightly floral and kind of delicate.  Doesn’t have a stronger jasmine note like FE Green Tea.  The actual tea part of this works pretty well overall, but I’m getting something greener and fresher that doesn’t really belong in addition to that steeped green tea.\n\nAt lower percentages, this feels a bit minty to me.  There’s a more raw than steeped vegetation kind of note that seems to have a little bit of cooling to it.  As you start increasing the percentage it gets a bit more prominent and filled out while picking up something grassy.  As far as grassy notes go, it’s freshly cut and not overtly funky or aggressive, but it pulls me out of green tea profile a bit.\n\nFor the most part, has a reasonably accurate tea mouthfeel.  Slightly thin mouthfeel with a tea warmth.  Those fresher green notes do seem to be a bit more solid and have some cooling in there.  Overall effect is both kind of warm and cool, kind of like a mint tea.  This is least sweet of the new FLV Teas by itself.  This could conceivably be an unsweetened green tea.\n\nOf the new Flavorah green teas, this one seems to be the more traditional steeped green tea while FLV Eisai is more matcha-esque.\n\n**Off-Flavors:**  Fresher, minty and grassy vegetation in addition to the steeped green tea.  Not offensive or overwhelming, but doesn’t quite fit the profile.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light, not as throaty for me as FLV Black or Red Tea.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At .25%,  I’m mostly getting green tea leaves.  Most of the astringency in the flavor seems to be present right off the jump.  Feels dry and a bit thin.\n\nAt 1%,  this feels more like a full on tea.  That tea leave astringency is backed up by a slightly sweeter, warm body.  Moderately full for a tea flavor.  The fresh green flavor is starting to come in, and I pick up just a bit of cooling on the back end.\n\nAt 3%,  this doesn’t actually feel more astringent and bitter than lower percentages.  The tea note doesn’t seem all that different from 1%.  That fresher green flavor is pushing more toward lawn clippings up this high though.\n\nJust based on these tests,  I’d probably be using this as a green tea base around 1-1.5%.  I’m not sure this is the green tea base I’d use for a clear green tea accent, but you could give it a shot at .25%\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This should work better with fresher fruit flavors than anything too creamy or heavy.  That fresh green edge is going to stick out against any real dairy notes.  \n\nSeems like it would be a bit steamrolled by any really heavy, candied types of fruits.  I’d stick with lighter touches of more realistic fruits.\n\nShould also work well with lighter florals or citrus.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  [There’s an ELR page up, with some familiar names and some very positive day 1 pre-release type reviews.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/234669)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Overall effect is a like a tangy, overripe banana. I get some pineapple, coconut, and almost a cherry/strawberry here as well. Some tart, raw, astringent green notes to watch for but really interesting and full tropical flavor without tasting like an umbrella drink.\n\nInhale is a bit green and astringent with a soft banana flavor.  Exhale opens up with tart, thin pineapple top notes on top of a ripe bordering overripe banana. Some bright fruitiness there too, a lot like a strawberry or cherry flavor. Banana crosses into creaminess and really shows up on the back half of the exhale. Non-dairy and almost like a coconut milk. Moderately dense, exhale has a natural fruit sweetness. That pineapple note kind of leaves your mouth a bit raw.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Green peel notes, more astringent than earthy. Not super prominent, but noticeable.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Nah, but it does definitely leave your mouth feeling a bit raw.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:** Really, just mix /u/deejaymillsnyc/ 's [Batido de Guanabana.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/53xeu2/batido_de_guanabana/) Awesome use of this concentrate in a creamy milkshake base.  Goes really well with creams.  Has enough backbone to stand up in a custard as well, although that green note is something to watch with buttery or eggy notes.  This would also pair really well with a creamy coconut.\n\nFruit mixes will be tricky, in that you're likely going to be just reinforcing the flavors that already here and pushing the whole thing out of balance. /u/fuck_u_mean/ talked about that in a comment on a [FLV Soursop review:](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/5ahfyh/flv_soursop/) \" I've been having a hell of a time finding good pairing that don't just accentuate some of the flavors already present in the individual concentrates (ie pineapple, strawberry, coconut, banana, cream.)\"  The more I mess with this, the more I agree wholeheartedly.  Might help to approach this backwards and use this at a low percentage to boost either a banana a pineapple into a riper, sweeter more realistic fruit.\n\n**Notes:**\nS&V concentration testing, fairly dull and non-descript at 1% and under. Just sort of sweaty, creamy vaguely tropical taste. At 1.5% tastes quite a bit like a real banana. The green notes are doing a good job adding some dimension and depth to that soft banana flavor. Really nice at 2%. Those brighter fruit notes show up and that tartness/green flavor is still very much in the background. 3% is personally about as high as I'd go from single flavor testing. It just starts to get a bit weird and too tart. Anything higher, and you're going to need some cream to temper that green edge, /u/deejaymillsnyc/ uses this at 4%, so it's certainly possible.  I'd mix this at 1.5% as a supporting player behind other fruits, maybe 2.5 to 3% as a primary note with other fruits in the mix, and 4% if you want to go full out with creams.\n\nAlready touched on this quite a bit on the soursop review, but the flavor review list didn't have a seperate entry. This is really tasty, if a bit hard to mix with.\n\n**Second Opinions:** \n\n[Quick take from DiyOrDie, mango heavy with a lot of pine.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Hazelnut, .25, 1, and 3%, others noted, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 6 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** This is an fairly potent hazelnut flavor that starts off fairly easygoing but gets odd quickly.\n\nThis flavor seems a bit top heavy overall, with an aggressive raw hazelnut top note.  I do get some base out of this at higher percentages, but that rawer hazelnut note starts to really pick up and gets very aggressive.  Almost a bit astringent like hazelnut skin.\n\nAt lower percentages, there is actually a pretty solid hazelnut flavor in here.  There's a softer body, with some very light roasted, warmer notes. I think there is some creaminess to the body here, but getting to it is a bit difficult with that aggressive rawness right up front.\n\nI'm not picking up too much that feels heavily nutty, at least solo at lower percentages. That rawer note is making it hard to really dig in there and taste much at higher precentages.\n\nIt's a bit hard to put this into context of other hazelnut flavors. FW is creamier and warmer. FA Hazel Grove is also super potent and has a nice snap to it, but leans more toward the raw side of things. This is probably more aggressively raw than the FA version, but it doesn't really have a lot of that nutty body at usuable percentages.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Not really a mellow bakery hazelnut. At higher percentages, this starts to pick up a whole lot of weirdness.  That green note starts to pick up a chemical, almost gasoline taste to it.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Nah, not really.  Fairly smooth.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  This works far better at .25% than any of the tested percentages. I'm not getting some of pyrazine-type nuttiness I'd expect, but there's a mild raw hazelnut flavor. Not a lot in warmth or \"roasted\" flavor, but it's a solid raw hazelnut top note.\n\nAt 1%, this feels way too intense. Still not nutty or roasted, and that that rawer, green flavor is picking up a hard chemical edge.  That light bit of bitterness has gone full on to smelling gasoline.  I really wouldn't try to make this work up here.\n\nAt 3%, those off-notes are sort of terrifying. I'm still getting a hazelnut flavor in there somewhere, but those off notes are extremely aggressive.\n\nJust based on these tests, I'd stay low with this, definitely under .5%. There's hazelnut here, but you may want to work up a dilution and start low.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This one is going to be tough. I'd mostly just take advantage of how top heavy this feels, and use it as a low percentage additive to a heavier and warmer nut flavor. Just out of curiosity I threw about .2% of this on top of 3% FW Flavorwest, and it did help to make that flavor feel a bit more like a defined hazelnut.\n\nYou may be able to use a dilution type percentage of this on top of a heavier chocolate flavor to get some of that nutella top note.\n\nFeels like a cheat to say tobacco, but this could work to bring in a green hazelnut note to an aromatic tobacco mix.\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Some really light, slightly sour kind of body but predominantly just a spicy heat without a flavor attached.  Throat hit feels a bit more like cinnamon than chili peppers, but it's a really clean spice note.  I can maybe, just barely, taste some cinnamon in here, but I'm pretty sure I'm imagining it based on the heat present and the way the throat hit is working.  I get spice on the inhale and through the entire vape, with it really ramping up on the back half of the exhale.  Usage percentage is all going to be personal taste. 1% is interesting and not overwhelming to me personally, but nothing tastes weird or off higher than that.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Nope. They say heat on the bottle, and that's pretty much all you get.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Yeah, but it's kind of the point. Spicy throat hit as opposed to chemical.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Use this to add spice and throat hit to a mix without really changing the flavor profile.  Interesting to use with fruits (especially tropical fruits), candies, creams, and beverages.\n\nThe throat hit is pretty nice as far as throat hit goes. I've heard people recommend using TPA Jalapeño or something to add throat hit into juices without nicotine, and I think this would work better. Pretty solidly neutral flavor, with nothing chemical or weird.\n\n**Notes:**  Percentage use is going to really subjective.  No huge limiting factor besides your own spice tolerance. I get a clear heat accent at .25%, but it's not overwhelming at all.  If I had to tie it to a spice level, I'd go for like a Anaheim chile. 5% is starting to read as spicy to me.  1% is definitely present, and that throat hit is picking up. Maybe equivalent to like a Pasilla at this level. 1.5% is about the limit I'd personally want in a vape. Heavy throat hit and really clear spice.  About a typical mexican restaurant salsa level of spice here. 2% is still vapable for me, but not quite pleasant.  Just more spice and throat hit. 3% was a bad idea, but nothing really tastes off here.  I do think I taste some cinnamon here, but it's mostly spice and throat hit.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Hibiscus @ 1% and 1 drop per 10 ml (about .25%), 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 9 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  This is interesting. Green leafy base with a lighter floral edge to it.  Not even a passing resemblance to [CAP Hibiscus](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/5dhnoy/cap_hibiscus/), much closer to [FA Jasmine](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/5n1ksr/fa_jasmine/) with the mouthfeel of [FA Violet](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/5uop2a/fa_violet/) Solid, slightly powdery mouthfeel.  Heavily concentrated, and not really a flavor you want as a main note. I'd use this as a realistic fruit floral accent with some bonus solid mouthfeel, at maybe .1-.2%.\n\nInhale has a sharper floral note with a sweet powdery base. Floral note is hard to nail down exactly, but it's close to a jasmine where it's brighter and lighter than something like a heavier rose or geranium. Somewhere between fresh rain and warm spring air (I promise that isn't unduly trying to talk up the flavor, I'm just not a horticulturist here.)  Pretty solid, powdery base with a solid but not cloying sweetness.  Exhale has some pretty heavy green leaf notes right up front. It's more a bright green, so more in line with something like a cucumber rind than a swampy vegetal flavor. Higher floral top notes, same as the inhale.  Gets a little herbal shampoo-ish as low as .25%. Sweet, solid base with a dryer mouthfeel. A bit of lingering dryness and jasmine perfume.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  So this is more of a hibiscus flower than a hibiscus tea kind of flavor. Leaves and all.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Maybe a bit dry but nothing harsh.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I'd use it like FA Jasmine.  So it's mostly teas, and an additive to add some realism back to fruits.  I've used FA Jasmine to add a bit of pith back to citruses, and I think it will still work like that. I'd also use it for apples and pears to get that lightly floral edge back to a juicier base.\n\n**Notes:**  This is strong stuff. At .1%, I get mostly the floral part of this. The base is a bit thin but there is some lightly tart green leafiness to it.  Maybe a tiny bit of citrus sourness. .2% is a whole lot more solid, with that powdery base coming through pretty clearly. .5% seems a bit too floral and dry, like actually eating leaves instead of smelling them. 1% is not a good thing to do.  Don't do that.  I'd use this an accent at .1-.15% or as a stronger flavor in a tea at .2-.3%.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nNah, not really.\n\n[And here is the FLV product page. Their description: \"\nCrips and refreshing Hibiscus flower, goes very well with other fresh citrus and vegetal flavors like cucumber. Not overly aromatic, but crisp and light.

    "markdown": "##**FLV Honey Bee**##\n\n*Summary*  \nA very floral, honey flavor. It does have a nice bit of sweetness to it, reminiscent of honey, but very much floral. I liken it to a floral sweetness if you ever need that in a recipe. It is very potent, and probably will never need to be used above 0.25% or 0.5%. I'm glad they called it \"Honey Bee\" because this makes me think of the bees transporting pollen (floral) to create their honey (sweet). I could see using this in a tea or spiced tea vape that requires honey, with proper steeping and flavor bending.\n\n**On the Nose**  \nFlowers. With a somewhat dark undertone. \n\n**Recommended Usage**  \n*Stand alone*: 0.5%\n\n*In a mix*: <=0.25%. \n\n**Throat**  \nMild\n\n**Ideal Pairings**  \nFlorals, tobaccos, spices\n\n**Steep**  \n5-7 Days\n\n**Recipe Idea: [Lemon Honey Cough Drop](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/6407#lemon_honey_cough_drop_by_cheebasteeba)**  \n*Ratio: 12.5PG/87.5VG*  \n*Steep: 1+ week* \n\n**Ingredient**|**%**|\n:--|:--|\nINW Eucalyptus w/ Mint|1.5%|\nJF Juicy Lemon|3%|\nFLV Honey Bee|0.25%|\n\nThe FLV Honey Bee here I feel is essential, although it's a bummer it takes so long to steep to be in a good spot (especially if you have a sore throat and need something straight-away!). It works especially well here, since they INW Eucalyptus w/ Mint is more on the end of floral vapes, and you want some sweetness and honey to really make it palatable. The honey flavor in the honeys we're used to is floral, there's no way around it, and that's usually a bad thing, but here it works well to give you both the honey you want as well as complimenting the floral aspect of this vape.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Horchata @ 1% and 1 drop per 10 ml (about .25%), 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 14 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Horchata relatively heavy on the cinnamon. Good clean cinnamon note, but it's a bit aggressive compared to the lighter taste of the creamy rice milk base. Good body, and the cream and rice here is tasty, just taking a bit of a backseat to the cinnamon.  Seems a bit harsh but not unbearable. Really needs a bit of cream backup.  I'd use this at 1.5% with a cream to smooth it out for a primary note or .5% as a cinnamon accent in bakeries.\n\nInhale has richer cinnamon up front, with a deeper creamy base.  Some light rice nuttiness here, but the cinnamon washes it out a bit. Moderately dense and just a bit dry, with a pretty realistic tasting sweetness level.  Exhale is creamier and fuller.  Higher realistic cinnamon notes, not quite as dry as a full bakery cinnamon but still quite a bit of body. Creamier base is pretty neutral at first, but picks up a light rice character towards the end of the exhale. Still dead on for sweetness, with a fairly thick mouthfeel. Some harshness here, as the cinnamon is just a bit too aggressive for the base and dries out the vape a bit. Lingering cinnamon and a bit of rice nuttiness.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Nah, nothing that shouldn't be there.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Moderate.  I'm getting a bit of chest tightness along with some harshness on the back of the throat. I will say this definitely needs a bit of a steep to calm down.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Solo, I feel like the cinnamon level here is dead on for a horchata.  I think this could stand a bit of cream to smooth this out and maybe a hit of that new-fangled FE Sweet Rice to really push the rice here.\n\nOutside of a horchata dominant vape, Flavorah suggests using this in bakeries, and I could see that. The cinnamon note here is actually pretty mellow but still fairly realistic, and that body and light nutty note from the rice is going to blend well to add volume and cinnamon to your bakeries.  It obviously needs a steep, but mixing this at 1% with 2% FA Apple Pie seems to have serious promise.\n\n**Notes:** S&V concentration testing, this isn't crazy strong. At .25% I get a clear body but not a whole lot of flavor. Some light cinnamon and just a hint of cream. .5% has a pretty identifiable cinnamon, but still not much creaminess. 1% is good, with a balanced slightly dry bakery cinnamon note and a denser cream body with a tiny bit of that nutty rice milk flavor especially towards the tail end of the exhale. 1.5% has more cinnamon to it.  Still not completely blowing the rest of the vape out but it's getting a bit prominent. Rice note is a bit more pronounced as well. 2% is heavy on the cinnamon for me, washing out some of the nuance of the rice milk part of the vape. 3% isn't really working for me. Too much cinnamon. I'd use this a primary horchata note with some cream or rice backup at 1.5%, and an additive for bakeries at .75-1%.\n\nI haven't ever got on the horchata vape train, so I can't really comment on how this compares to other available horchata concentrates. I will say, for this being my first horchata concentrate, I'm not mad at it, and I could see how people are into vaping that profile.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nAgain, not a whole lot.\n\n[Here is the FLV product page. Their description: \"Creamy cinnamon with milky smoothness… If you are not familiar with this refreshing Latin American drink, then you owe it a try the next time you have a chance. Before then, try our horchata. It’s a blend of the flavors of starchy rice pudding and a rich warm cinnamon.

I'm getting some clear cooling on the exhale, but that bitterness is a bit of a bummer. Koolada at 1% will blow my entire vape out, and I'm not getting a ton of cooling from this at 1%.  This feels like maybe 1/3 as strong as Koolada in terms of cooling.  Not to editorialize too much, but I though FLV Cool Menthol was really well done, but this falls a bit flat for me. I'm not seeing a lot of applications for this where Koolada isn't cleaner and a better fit.  I could be having some kind of weird reaction to this, but this isn't really working for me as well as I had hoped.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  This tastes a bit bitter to me.  Not a really strong kind of chemical taste, but a weird kind of bitterness here that almost crosses into savory. \n\n**Throat Hit:**  Seems to add a bit of throat hit to the juice.  The bitterness kind of accumulates at the back of the throat.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Use is pretty interchangable with Koolada but it seems weaker.  I can see this working better with more basic sweet fruit mixes, where that light bitterness may actually help cut some sweetness.\n\nKoolada gets used in low percentages with cream bases for chilled milkshakes and ice creams. The bitterness here makes Ice a worse choice in those applications.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration wise, this seems quite a bit weaker than I'd expect.  This was all tested with 1% FLV Grape in the mix as well. I get some bitterness and maybe a bare hint of cooling at .25%. .5% isn't drastically cooler, maybe about equivalent to 2 drops per 30ml of Koolada.  1% is a bit cooler, but I'm really picking up that bitterness.  I've definitely got that building bitterness at the back of my throat.  1.5% still isn't unbearably cool for me. Bitterness seems to have topped out though. 2% is maybe about equivalent to a little over .5% of Koolada.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nI haven't found any, which is a bummer because I'm curious if it's just me that this isn't working for or if I got a weird batch.\n\n[Here is the FLV product page.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Irish Cream @ 1% and 1 drop per 10 ml (about .25%), 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 13 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Coffee forward Irish Cream. Almost more like a cup of dark roasted coffee with a solid slug of Irish Cream. Dense, fluffy texture, with a slighty nutty taste to the chocolate cream back end.  Coffee note is closer to a traditional coffee note like FA Dark Bean rather than a syrupy coffee liqueur.  Chocolate cream notes basically scale up after .25% work hit their stride around 1%. Pretty full, dominant flavor, I'd use as pretty much a standalone with some selective backup starting at .75% and working up.\n\nInhale is sweet and almost a bit marshmallow-y, with a fluffy texture.  Higher dark roasted coffee notes with a bit of a bittersweet chocolate edge.  Base has a heavy cream taste but not quite the texture, just a bit too airy. Exhale has a sweet dark coffee note up front, more like a sweet black coffee as opposed to a coffee liqeuer. Top notes start to come out and are pretty similar to darker roasted strong coffee flavors, with a bit of dark almost burnt bitterness.  Not overwhelmingly strong at 1%, doesn't quite pick up that buttery burnt note I get from some solo coffee flavors.  Creamier base also comes out on the back end, with a deeper slightly nutty heavy cream kind of taste with a bit of chocolate to it.  I think the combination of the top notes from the dark roasted coffee and the milkier chocolate base together are making up that nutty note.  All of it is fairly well balanced overall. Relatively dense, but fairly fluffy instead of a heavier solid cream note.  Sweet, but a sugar kind of sweetness, as opposed to a heavy sucralose hit.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  More of a dark black coffee note than a sweeter softer coffee liquer.  I personally wouldn't feel the need to add any more cofee on top of this.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light, a little dry and fluffy solo.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This is a fairly busy flavor, especially up towards 1% and I'd say it's better as a stand-alone, or a the base for a flavor with some careful accents.  You could accentuate the cream here with some FLV Cream or CAP Vanilla Whipped Cream for a touch of something like whipped cream on top.  You could also go down the chocolate route with INW Mocca or FLV Milk Chocolate if you wanted to end up with a mocha.\n\nOutside of a coffee with Irish Cream vape, I think this would make a really good base for a coffee ice cream or milkshake.  It's fairly creamy on it's own at 1% and above, adding in some vienna cream and vbic should get you pretty close to an ice cream flavor.\n\nIf you want to pair a fruitier accent, I'd stick to darker berries.  Should also pair well with a bit of mint.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, I get a clear flavor here at .25%. Lots of that coffee note up front, with a bit of more neutral, slightly nutty cream on the back end. A bit fluffy, not a lot of richness. .5% doesn't really seem to have that much more coffee than .25%, cream is a little heavier and I'm getting a bit of a cocoa edge to that nuttier cream on the back end.  At 1%, the back end of this is really starting to solidify and I'm getting some heavier cream notes and a definite chocolate to it. Pretty full flavored as is with a denser but still slightly fluffy texture.  At 1.5%, I'm getting a bit of that buttery burnt kind of coffee taste out of the coffee part of this, while the cream is kind of getting buttery and whipped at the same time. Not necessarily a good time. 2% seems pretty solidly bitter up front.  I'd recommend using this as a primary flavor between .75-1.5%, depending on your personal tolerance for coffee vapes.\n\nComparing this to FA Irish Cream, the FLV seems a little more geared towards tasting like a full coffee vape. I get more dark coffee out of the FLV than the FA version. The FA Version ends up being more realistic to just Irish Cream, although they both have their charms.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nAgain, not a whole lot.\n\n[Here is the FLV product page.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Jackfruit @ 1% and 1 drop per 10 ml (about .25%), 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 7 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Juicy slightly overripe pineapple with a nice bright tartness.  Sweet, but more accurate to overripe fruit than candy.  Relatively light almost fermented funk to this, with some yeasty, bready notes.  I'd use this as an accent to ripen and juice up stone fruits at .5%, 1% for tropical fruits, and up to 1.5% with pineapples and mangoes.\n\nInhale has some really bright, tart and slightly acidic overripe, almost canned pineapple up top. A bit on the airy side, and heavily sweet. Sweetness tastes closer to an actual fruit and doesn't quite cross into candy solo.  Exhale has a sweet, juicy pineapple up front.  Less sharp than straight pineapple, but seems like a sweeter, riper version of the same flavor. I get some higher slightly funky bready notes, like overripe fruit.  Moderate body along with that juiciness actually makes this taste fleshy. I get some more subtle tropical fruit flavors towards the tail end of the exhale.  Almost a musky papaya or guava kind of kick after that overripe pineapple. Still sweet overall, but maybe a bit less than the inhale.  Just a bit of harshness from that brighter inhale, but the exhale is pretty smooth. Lingering tartness and some of that fermented funk.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  This tastes very ripe, and has a funkier overripe note. I'm not sure how accurate it is to actual jackfruit (although some half-assed googling seems to confirm it's actually a thing with jackfruit), but it can be a bit offputting if you overdo it.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Not really. Maybe just a little bit from some of the tartness here, but it's pretty mellow.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I really like this as support for tropical fruits, bringing some extra juiciness and ripe realism in an accent role. Works really well pineapple, but I could see it also working with your custard apples (cherimoya, soursop, guanabana), mango, papaya, and guava as well. It's not the most scientific description, but this definitely tastes ripe and \"tropical\" and it shares enough similarities with the brighter tropical fruits to really make them taste ripe and a bit juicier without overwhelming them.\n\n**Notes:** S&V concentration testing, this isn't crazy strong. .25% is light and a bit fruity, with a fairly subtle tartness and a flatter overripe note. .5% is already fairly sweet, with that pineapple note coming through.  I'm getting some juice and fleshiness here, but it's tasting just a bit flat and that fermented note seems a bit out of the balance with the base. 1% is actually pretty great, tastes a lot like a more realistic, brighter CAP Golden Pineapple with some overripe notes at the end. 1.5% is even sweeter, a bit sharp, and that fermented note is pretty pronounced. 2% is too sweet for me personally, and I feel like the fermented part of this is getting a bit heavy and weird. I'd recommend using this behind other fruits, I think at .5% there aren't too many places this would be completely out of place, I could see it with apples, cherries, and plums too add some tartness, juiciness, and ripeness. At 1%-1.5% the flavor is a bit more aggressive, but I think it would do a great job of supporting anything you want to read as distinctly tart and tropical like mangoes and pineapples.\n\nThe only other Jackfruit I'm aware of is TPA, and FLV seems to be quite a bit juicier, a little riper, and have more of fresh fruit sweetness as opposed to a candy sweetness. Actual flavor profile is fairly similar, FLV just tastes a lot more like actual fruit.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nAgain, not a whole lot.\n\n[One note on ELR by user Iam168: \"Smells great! tested at 2% 70/30 finger test...Very real tasting not that sweet at all..Vaping taste just as good as tpa jackfruit or if not better!

Speaking from personal experience, the fruit smells so good that you want to rip into it with your fingers and get a bite, but beware of the latex sap that will cover everything if you do. Flavorah Jackfruit has ripe melon-like notes with a tropical punch baseline.

    "markdown": "*Disclaimer: I didn't pay for this, shoutout to Flavorah for sending this to me.*\n\n**Setup:** Recoil w/ flavor barrel, Dual 12 wrap 24g 3.5mm SS316 @.31 ohms. 60w power, 450F temp limit. Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Flavorah Kinako Soy, .25%, 1% and 3%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 14 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Roasted, nutty, and sweet.\n\nIn my ongoing struggle with complete cultural ignorance, I’ve never actually had straight Kinako.  I’m pretty sure I’ve had it on top of mochi before, but that’s about the extent of my personal experience with it.  It’s a roasted soybean flour basically, and the slightly incomparable Leilani said it had a lot in common with powdered peanut butter.  That pretty much checks out for me. \n\nPretty heavily nutty, somewhere between sesame seeds and roasted peanuts.  Seems fairly generic, in that there doesn’t seem to be anything really distinctive about the nuttiness.  Nutty without having a harder, crispy Acetyl Pyrazine type of texture to it.  Has a pretty deep toasted warmth to it.\n\nFairly sweet overall. Reminds me of lot INW Sesame Sweets, with a sort of honey or caramel twinge to the sweetness.  I think the primary difference is going to be the fullness of the vape.  While INW Sesame Sweets kind of blows out the top notes and base of flavors you mix it with, this seems maybe a bit less full in the base.  Should actually make it a bit easier to work with though.\n\n**Off-Flavors:**  I can’t really comment on profile accuracy, but nothing unpleasant here.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Nah, not really.  Seems really fairly smooth.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At %.25 i’m getting a moderate nuttiness and a little bit of warmth.  Mild sweetness, but feels maybe a bit thin.  Seems fairly top heavy at this percentage.\n\nAt 1%, this is sweeter but doesn’t feel much nuttier.  A little thicker in general.  No real off notes.  Feels a bit more toasted, but not burnt.\n\nAt 3%, Still not tasting burnt.  Not much thicker than 1%. Sweeter, kind of tastes like honey roasted peanuts without the crunchiness.  No real off flavors.\n\nI think this is definitely from the Sesame or Maple school of flavors, where they work as flavors relatively high, but they tend to dominate mixes.  So even mixed up at 3% I wasn’t really getting anything “off” or unpleasant, but it will push a mix around quite a bit up there.  Your usage percentage is going to depend more on how much the other flavors around this can take.  Works well lower, so maybe start at .25% and work up until your mix gets too nutty.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**   Seems like a good way to add a nutty, warm top note to mixes without bringing in a heavier AP texture.  Should pair well with creams in general, still getting that nuttieness across without really messing with the texture of the mix.\n\nWhile not a mochi flavor by itself, might be useful putting some nuttier notes on top of something like FE Sweet Rice to get a bit closer.\n\nUseful for punching up peanut butters or other nuts without making them too crunchy.\n\nI could see this working to make something like FLV Granola seem a bit sweeter and nuttier.\n\nOr hell, throw it in a desert tobacco.\n\n**Second Opinions:**   [There’s an ELR Page up with some flavor notes.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/234673)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Kiwi @ 1% and 1 drop per 10 ml (about .25%), 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 8 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  If you told me this was some kind of cantaloupe or a funkier muskmelon flavor, I'd believe you. It's interesting. I get a creamy texture, with a heavy musk to it, and a very deep melon-y sweetness.  Not necessarily too different from a kiwi sweetness, but it's definitely trending towards a softer cantaloupe as opposed to the brighter kiwi that leans a bit towards honeydew. There's a bit of tartness in the back half of the exhale, but it's subtle and competing with some serious floral notes and some ammonia especially up at 1%.  Overall, it seems like it's going to be a fairly difficult flavor to mix, and It's not really conjuring up a kiwi for me.  It's also crazy strong, bordering on overwhelming by .2%.\n\nInhale is a bit airy up top, but theres a sharp floral note. Base is a little denser, fairly netural but it has a creamier density. Not a lot of actual flavor here, but some tartness that kind of seems like it fits in with a kiwi. Exhale has a deeper sweet base and a creamy texture. y melon-y with a bit of a brighter, tarter kiwi in there. Top notes here are really assertive, with a musky almost floral taste and some pretty noticeable ammonia. Lingering bitterness and ammonia, at least at .25%.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  There's not much here that really makes me think of kiwi. I've got a creaminess, a heavy floral note, and a bit of ammonia to it.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Not really?  The floral edge can get harsh, but that's mostly over .5% and not really where I'd want to be mixing this.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I've been trying to get this to work to add some of the musky rind back into a cantaloupe with decidedly mixed results. I keep banging my head on it, but the balance between a pleasant musk and full on floral and ammonia with this seems really tricky.  Theoretically it should work, because this has a pretty spot on deep sweetness for a cantaloupe, and the creaminess should work really well for a ripe melon texture, that floral note is just a bit too prominent. My last test was at .2% behind 1.25% FLV Canteloupe, and it's still coming on a bit strong.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nLess is definitely more with this. FWIW, This is definitely isn't a S&V concentrate.  I made a dilution to test this.  .05% seems a bit light, and it's a bit hard to pick out. .1% is definitely present, with some melon style creaminess and a lighter musk note.  At .15% I can start to barely get some ammonia on the backend of this, and that musky note is getting a bit floral. .2% is a bit too floral, and that ammonia is distracting. .25% is just not working for me, with a clear floral edge and some of that ammonia. 1% is not a good time.\n\nIt's hard not to feel like I'm a bit off on the melon thing, but this is a bit of an oddball concentrate. As always, second opinions and experience with this flavor is hugely appreciated.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nNah, not really.\n\n[Here's the Flavorah broduct page.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Lembas Bread, .25, 1, and 3%, others noted, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 9 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Not 100% sure what this is supposed to be, but it tastes like a fruit muffin base to me.\n\nSoft bakery texture, with a distinct muffin-ness to it. Almost a less sweet, slightly more savory cupcake/yellow cake flavor without any kind of frosting note. Texture here is fluffy, with a softer grain to it. Tastes like it's just a hair underflavored for how fluffy that base is, and I can pick up just a bit of a cardboard solo.  Lighter cook on this, but you do get at least a bit of carmelization. I'm not picking out anything particularly rich, and it seems like it could use just a bit more butter.  Definitely does taste a bit yellow though, so that's probably a good sign.\n\nThe fruitiness here is interesting. It's sort of comparable to [FLV Blueberry muffin](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/653oqj/flv_blueberry_muffin/), where you can feel where the bakery should be without a distinct flavor, just reversed. I can feel a bit of brighter, tarter, fruitiness in here but it doesn't really have a distinct taste.  It shows up at the front of the flavor for me.  I've been obsessing a bit about blueberry muffin while doing this review, and so it's starting to taste like the beginning of a blueberry note, but it's really non-specific and definitely on the lighter side.  I seem to pick up more fruit on the room note than I actually do in the vape, which is interesting.\n\nSweetness is pretty on point for a muffin, not completely savory but not cupcake sweet.  That fruity note is more tart than sweet.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Does not taste nearly elven enough.  Feels like a bit of balancing act in terms of off flavors, at lower percentages it doesn't quite feel filled in and has a bit of cardboard to it. At higher percentages you lose a lot of that but you also start to pick up a really light anise twinge. Nowhere near as aggressive as CAP Yellow Cake, but it's the same kind of flavor.  Doesn't seem to pick up that muddy thing though.  I'm just assuming this is a muffin, if it isn't then who knows?\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At .25% I definitely get some of the taste, but very little of the texture beyond just fluffy.  The underflavoring on top of that fluffy base with texture is a bit off-putting.\n\nAt 1%, this has filled in substantially but still feels like it could go higher. Texture is pretty much there, but it feels like it needs a bit more flavor to it to avoid going cardboardy.  Fruityness is more noticeable here, but it's still just an accent.\n\nAt 3%, I get a heavier texture to it, and it's starting to dry out a bit.  Less cardboard, but a bit of anise sneaking in on the back end. Good \"cooked\" caramelized type of flavor to the bakery overall.\n\nJust because it's the obvious next step, I mixed 2% Lembas Bread with 3% FLV Blueberry muffin, and yeah, that's a blueberry muffin. It seems a bit dry, and the blueberry could stand to be cranked up a bit, but it's a pretty solid blueberry muffin.  Who says dreams don't come true?\n\nBased on these tests, I'd probably be using this around 2% with maybe just a bit of textural help.  Should be high enough to get a distinct muffin taste without going weird.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Feels like it could use just a bit of a boost in the texture department to stand up in mixes.  I'd probably try a bit of either CAP or TPA Vanilla cupcake.  Your muffin is likely going to be pretty sweet anyway, and at a low enough percentage it shouldn't drag in much frosting texture.  I think this could also benefit from a bit of TPA butter for some extra richness. \n\nYou know that thing where FLV Blueberry Muffin is a really good cooked blueberry but it doesn't really have a muffin note? Flavorah apparently found it in their warehouse and have to decided to sell it back to us.  Should work well with most syrupy fruits to make a muffin, especially if you bring in that textural help.  Fruit note is going to be versatile, so go nuts.  Outside of berries, I could see cinnamon and apples, bananas and nuts, or whatever strikes your muffin fancy.\n\nInteresting base for lighter, fluffier bakeries that aren't inherently all that sweet.\n\nMight work okay to fill out a more savory bread without adding any kind of yeast notes.\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Lemon @ 1% and 1 drop per 10 ml (about .25%), 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 14 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Bright, tart lemon juice along with a lemonhead candy base at higher percentages.  The tartness here is realistic to actual lemon juice.  Not a ton of zest, although I start to pick up some \"pledge\" notes at 1.5%.  Candy sweetness starts to really pick up at 1%. Seems to have some issues with the lemon flavor fading out a bit, but the tartness sticks around.  Bit of harshness, but nothing too bad for the realistic parts of a lemon. I'd use this as a tart accent at lower percentages, and a candy lemon for quick steeping recipes at 1.5-2%.\n\nInhale is airy with a pretty heavy tartness bordering on sour. Tartness is pretty close to fresh lemon juice. Sweet, candy lemon base.  Exhale is a bit denser, but still on the light side.  Sweet Lemonhead candy base with higher, tart lemon up high. Not really a bitter zest, more like the spray of oil you get off the peel.  Pretty sweet overall, sugary candy sweetness without any kind of artificial sweetener note.  Moderately harsh overall. Lingering rawness from the tarter part of this and some sugar lips from the sweeter base.\n\nConcentrate seperates quite a bit, so make double-plus sure you shake before use.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Not really. Seems a lot like two seperate lemon flavors in on bottle. One is tart, realistic, and light the other is heavier sweet lemon candy. Neither is bad, but they don't quite seem to cohere into a single flavor.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Moderate. I got a good amount of harshness the first time I picked this up but when I came back a couple hours later it wasn't all that bad. I'm guessing it'll end up on the harsh side for some people.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This is going to be interesting in mixing. The tartness here is pretty prominent even at .25% and seems to stick around after a medium length steep.  I could see using this more for a tartness in citrus applications, like adding a small percentage into a lemonade or adding some edge to a more candied lemon concentrate like FA Lemon Sicily or JF Juicy Lemon.  I could also see it is a bright accent in fruit mix, adding some spark back to heavier, syrupy, or jammy berry flavors.\n\nThe fading issue limits higher percentage applications where you're going to get a lot more of that lemon candy. FWIW, this is actually pretty good without a steep, so maybe use it as a lemon candy flavor when you want a S&V or short steep.  It's still tart and sweet after a steep, but that actual lemon flavor seems a bit flat.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, unfortunately it looks like this one fades out quite a bit. The tart part of this sticks around really well, but the lemon flavor was definitely less pronounced after a 2 week steep. At .25% I get mostly tartness, maybe a light hint of a fairly realistic zest. .5% is still tart, but still on the thin side. Kind of tastes like a lemon twist in water here. 1% is a little heaiver, and sweeter.  Good tartness, and I'm getting a sweeter lemon candy flavor in the base.  The sweet lemon here seems more prominent than the zest. At 1.5% you're pushing into lemonhead flavor, tart, bright, and candied.  Sweetness keeps ramping up. At 2%, the candy base is still picking up steam. The tartness and higher lemon notes are getting a bit pledge-y though it's still pretty well balanced by the sweeter base. At 3%, I'm definitely getting a bit too much of that pledge flavor over that sweet candy base. Also getting a bit harsh. Because this may have some fading issues, I'd limit using this to relatively quick steeping mixes, either fruit mixes that don't take a huge steep or candy mixes where you're after some of that candy sweetness.  For a tart accent, I'd use .75%-1.25%, and for a full lemonhead I'd use around 2%.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nAgain, not a whole lot.\n\n[True, real fruit lemon with bright citrus notes.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Lemon Tea @ 1% and 1 drop per 10 ml (about .25%), 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 14 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Accurate and warm lightly sweetened tea, heavy on lemons with some black tea on the backend.  The lemon here manages to avoid being too candied but doesn't really push into pledge territory. It's more the bright, thin lemon flavor you get from steeping lemon slices in your tea. Black tea takes a bit of a backseat behind all that lemon, but it's fairly realistic with an earthy, astringent edge. A bit harsh solo, kind of cries out for a rounder sweetness or a bit of cream to cut all the thinner lemon and earthy tea.  I'd use this as a primary flavor in a mix and build around it to get the tea vape that you want.  I feel like this flavor is most balanced around .5%,  with the lemon getting more dominant up to 1.5% and the astringency and earthiness of the tea picking up after that. You may want to go higher if you're planning on messing with it a bunch, but you'll be punching down parts of the flavor with other concentrates as they pop up.\n\nInhale is warm and a bit airy, with sharp lemon up front. Lemon note is more like steeped lemon slices than a lot of available concentrates. Some black tea earthiness in the top notes, and a lightly sweet deep base to it.  Exhale has a pretty interesting, light, warm character to it, a lot like actual tea. I get some more solid lemon right up front, with some steeped zest top notes.  Lemon forward, with the tea here relegated mostly to the backend. End result is more like a herbal tea than a straight black tea with lemon. Black tea top notes on the end, with a fairly accurate earthiness and just a bit of astringency to it.  I still wouldn't call it a sweet tea, but there's some sugary sweetness in here. I get some harshness from this, that bright lemon, warmth, and relative thiness is a bit harsh on the throat.\n\n\n**Off-flavors:** At higher percentages this gets fairly astringent, bitter, and earthy.  It's not really an off flavor, because tea can definitely come across that way, but solo this isn't a sweet tea flavor which is probably more of what people would expect in vape.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Moderate, this gets pretty bright and acidic from the lemon and a bit astringent from the tea. I'd call it accurate to warm tea, but it's a bit harsh without either cream or something sweeter in there.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This is damn close to a single flavor.  I'd use it up right up front and accent it. You could play on the less sweet, almost herbal tea quality of this and do what /u/HocusKrokus/ did with his [Serenity recipe.](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/38095#serenity_by_hocuskrokus).  He's adding back in some FA Black Tea to get around that lemon heavy nature of the concentrate, and adding some cream to smooth the entire thing out. He also adds lavender, because there is clearly something wrong with him.  I might go in the spearmint direction instead to really sell the herbal thing instead of going the floral route.\n\nThe other direction would be to sweeten the holy hell out of this to get closer to something like a sweet or iced tea. I wouldn't add any more citrus here, but peaches, raspberries, and mango all work really well with tea and the brightness from the lemon here should let you use heavier fruits that have some body to them.\n\n**Notes:**  This is interesting, and seems to change quite a bit based on percentage used. .25% is a bit on the light side, more just a hit of steeped lemon and warmth, with the black tea just sort of adding dimension to the lemon note. At .5%, I'm getting pretty clear lemon, and the earthiness on back end is a bit more clear. It's not a strong, punch you in taste buds type of flavor, but that kind of strength isn't something I necessarily associate with tea. I like the balance here for a lighter tea. 1% is heavier on the lemon, and it's sharper but I've got no pledge note from this.  1.5% is even heavier on lemon, it feels like the tea note hasn't really changed much from .5%. 2% starts to bring back in that tea, and I'm getting a bit of astringency and the earthiness is bit more solid and clearly reads as black tea. 2.5% is clearly black tea on the back end. 3% is a bit astringent to me, and the earthiness notes are reading a bit dirty. 4% is getting weird and astringent for me solo, where it's almost tasting like older dandelion greens. Personally, I like this down at .5%, and I'd probably use it for a lighter vape in general. I think this is usable higher, and I've enjoyed it at 2.5%, but you're going to have to address and round out some the harshness here.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[One note on ELR by user \"BoyHowdy\" (awesome name, that): \"mixed at 4% , let steep 7 days.Taste is nice but it is a strong lemon and lite on the tea flavor.Good flavor but not the southern sweet tea with lemon I was expecting to find.I will try adding a tea and see how it works out.\"](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/77805)\n\nHigher usage of this out in the community.

It's a really odd combination of realistic zest and artificial \"green\" lime flavor.  Little oddball, but this reminds me of the green flavor in Surge soda. Lots of description as Lime Jello and that fits, flavorwise if not texture.\n\nSharp lime zest on the inhale. Effervenscent \"green\" on the exhale with a moderate sweetness and a  Lingering bitterness.  Like FA Bergamot, almost pushes into a faint clove-type flavor on the back end from all that zest.  Fairly astringent.  Mouthfeel is a little dry behind that carbonation.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Try to vape this  solo and not think of cleaning products. Lime zest by itself gets you most of the way there.It definitely doesn't taste like ammonia, but it gives that kind of astringent, sharp vibe.  It's kind of like vaping windex @ 3%.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Light.  For as aggressive as this flavor is, it doesn't really rip up your throat.  Vaped solo, there is a little bit of throat hit, but you mostly feel a bit of a rawness all around your mouth.  It's strangely accurate mouthfeel for lime.\n\n**Uses:**  Hard flavor to get a handle on.  This isn't juicy, so it's going to make it hard to work in straight fruit blends or lime deserts.  The lime zest is okay, but FA Aurora works better for lime zest in cocktail vapes.  I'd focus on the \"green\" or apsect and take into a candy or soda vape.  Surge vape, anyone?  Some mention of using this as a slushie type flavor and I think that would be awesome.\n\n**Pairings:** Cap Jelly Candy.  Cactus for some sorely lacking juiciness. EM for that blindingly sweet \"green\" flavor and to mute some of the rougher lime zest notes.  Rounder, sweet citrus like CAP Sweet Tangerine or FA Mandarin. Maybe even some CAP Grapefruit for a citrus soda. I'd stay well away from creams and custards and jammy or dark fruits.  Bright non-floral fruits would contribute to a candy vibe.\n\n**Notes:** \n\nBizarre but kind of loveable.  The second opinions really helped figure out what I was actually tasting here. Reminds me of a more intense INW Lime.\n\nPercentage is key here. As a S&V test, this is plenty bright at .5%.  I like it closer to 1%, although I'm a sucker for this kind of flavor.  I'd go that range if you want to mix this with anything aggressive. If you want to use it as primary note, 2% should work well.  Anything above that and the cleaning product vibe gets too pronounced.\n\nShoutout to /u/apexified for sending this my way for review.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Easily overbearing for some people.  /u/arpzilla claims 1 drop per 10 ml is too strong.

I get a good amount of lime flesh, some brighter lime juice, and a not overwhelming hit of lime zest in the top notes. Realistic lime sweet, not candied. I'd use this more for a realistic lime accent, either with other sweeter limes or general fruit mixes.  Fairly concentrated, I'd use between .5-1.5%.\n\nInhale has a bright tart lime right up top, with a slight bitter edge. Not really a heavy zest flavor, more like fresh lime juice. A bit airy on the inhale, but some slightly sweet lime juice in the base. Exhale has a bit fleshier of a texture.

I can see it being used to give some nuance to one of those flavors, but I don't think this will do a great job of showing up by itself.\n\nI think my primary use is going to be in fruit forward flavors.

I can see it juicier applications, where some actual lime juice is involved, but it doesn't necessarily have that heavy zest hit I'd want for a cocktail accent.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, this is fairly strong but nothing crazy. At .25% I get a clear lime flavor, although it's a bit thin. .5% is pushing towards a full accent, still not a ton of body but a good tartness.  1% has a firmer, fleshier body with a bit of lime juice. Sharper and tarter, but the bitterness isn't out of control. 1.5% is about my usable limit. I'm getting quite a bit warmth and just a tiny hit of wax, but the body has a good balance of flesh and juice and the top notes have picked up a bit more zest. Pretty well balanced here. 2% seems a bit too sharp, and I'm getting some distracting waxiness. I'd recommend using this as an accent at .5% or a complimentary flavor at 1.5%.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nNot really.\n\n[And here is the FLV product page. Their description: \"Real fruit lime is crisp and bright with strong notes of both juice and skin. You can add it to a bit of fried dough and yakima hopps if you are chasing the Hefe or IPA, but it really shines in any thing that needs a citrus punch. \"  What the hell kind of hefeweizen are these people drinking?](http://store.flavorah.com/concentrated-lime-wedge-flavor)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Lovage @ .5%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 23 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  This is more of a flavor additive than stand alone. The review on the Flavorah website states that it \"tones\" flavors, and that seems as good a description as any. It seems to round out and give volume to green flavors, for better or worse. It also works a lot like a better version of ethyl maltol on citrus and seems to really define the edges of the flavors in tobaccos.\n\nAgain, not really a single flavor but just for the proverbial lulz... Inhale is sweet and dense, with a straight green note that has no kind of corresponding vegetal body. Exhale is dense with an earthier sweetness.  The green note kind of vanishes but it leaves a space on the tongue where I can kind of just feel like my tastebuds for sour and bitter have been lit up. Like something here is just priming those taste buds.  Just out of curiousity, I vaped a bunch of this and took a sip of a lime mineral water (shoutout to Trader Joe's) and the lime was especially bright and effervescent without tasting sour. It's definitely strange. I've also tried this all the way at 3% solo and it bears an uncanny resemblance to the filling from sweet potato pie.  Definite marshmallow sweetness and an earthy caramel taste.  Not bad, but weird as all hell.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Hard to tell what to call an off-flavor here. The earthyness solo definitely has just a hint of wet wool but I've never noticed that in a mix.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Light but there. Good deal of tightness in my throat vaping this solo. \n\n**Uses & Pairings:** So, this is where it gets useful.  This is a flavor toner all the way.\n\nThis does some really interesting things to green notes in fruits and fruit-like concentrates. INW Rhubarb is my personal favorite. It definitely gives the green, astringent note there some major depth and definition.  At .5% Rhubarb and .25% Lovage it gives you something that tastes a whole lot like lightly cooked rhubarb.  I tried this at .25% Lovage and 1% JF Honey Peach and it just pushed the green notes there into some really unpleasant territory. It doesn't add to the perfume aspect of the flavor but it does make the green notes a lot grassier and prominent.  Tested with FA Raspberry, FW Huckleberry, and FA Blackcurrant and it does largely the same thing. It pushes fruits into a weird green area that is a little too realistic to underripe fruit to make it pleasant.\n\nCitrus actually works surprisingly well, it seems to keep the brighter parts of those flavors while adding some volume and rounding off the harsher edges. Tested with FW Ruby Red Grapefruit, HS Green Orange, and FA Bergamot and the overall net effect was pretty damn positive. I'd say this deserves serious consideration as a citrus additive or alternative to Ethyl Maltol to make those harsher citruses more palatable.\n\nI also had a tester of FLV Native Tobacco lying around and ended up with about .5% Lovage and 3% Native Tobacco. It definitely gives some added dimension to the Tobacco and pushes the entire thing into a denser but still leafier and more defined taste.  Going further and adding in 2% FA Hypnotic Mist I got a really interesting, slightly sour, but still robust and defined tobacco mix.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nUse sparingly. Like really sparingly. This is an additive at heart, so treat as such. I'd use this at .25% with something like rhubarb or citrus. Tobaccos are a bit more robust and so I'd bump it up to .5% in those applications.\n\nWorth noting, this concentrate doesn't blend worth a damn. It's extremely thick and tends to just clump up when added, so amp that shaking up quite a bit to get it into suspension.  It's also impossible, as far as I can tell, to get a small drop of it with a dropper bottle.  The surface tension here gives you .05g drops at a minimum so bust out the pipettes to hit a low percentage.\n\nI still don't feel like I've cracked the case on this one.  The flavor, and even the consistency of the concentrate is confusing in a relatively good way.  Lots of potential for the person who nails down the usage here.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nNot a whole bunch, somewhat understandably.\n\n[Good if short notes on ELR.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/65005)\n\n[The actual Flavorah page.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Lychee @ 1% and 1 drop per 10 ml (about .25%), 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 7 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Sweet lychee with a pretty intense, bright floral edge.  Floral note here tastes pretty solid, not really thin and perfumey.  The base is fairly accurate to canned lychee, which somewhere between tarter rosehips and the grapes out of fruit cocktail.  Syrupy sweet, and a bit of a bully. I'd recommend mixing this sub .25% up to .5% and use it as a sweet, tropical base.\n\nInhale is sweet and moderately dense. Full, tart elderflower florals and a syrupy white grape kind of base.  There's almost a red berry kind of vibe to that the grape base, but it doesn't really taste like red grapes at all, if that makes any kind of sense. Exhale is sweet and full, with that canned lychee picking up some tarter rosehip kind of character. Florals in the top notes, but they are quite a bit more solid than the lighter perfumey notes you get off most other fruits. Really reminds me of FLV Elderflower, where it's a more solid, substantial floral note with some leafy green body to it.  Syrupy sweetness with just a hint of a darker caramel to it, that sticks to your mouth a bit. Not a lot of harshness, but it definitely has a throat hit to it. Lingering florals and sticky sweet mouthfeel. \n\n**Off-flavors:** This has pretty heavy floral punch to it.  The florals here aren't really offensive, and don't really have the thinness to taste perfumey.  It's a tarter, green, slightly more solid kind of floral.  I also think overall the concentrate can come off a bit soapy, especially when it's up too high in mix or mixed with something that has some earthniess to it. Shout out to Tootall for saying it kind of tastes like fresh laundry smells, because that's an excellent way of describing it.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Light, it's not harsh as much as those florals are pretty intense and tart and it's pretty sweet overall.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  A tricky flavor to mix.  The florals here tend to stick out in mixes, So i'd focusing mostly on brighter fruits and candy profiles. It's pretty intensely sweet, so at a lower percentage you'll get some good sweetness without a ton of that floral edge. The florals here seem to work well with that entire tropical thing, guava, grapes, cherries, and citrus in general.\n\nNot a ton of use in the cream or bakery department, but if you want to go in that direction keep it really light. This doesn't play well at all with any kind of buttery or eggy notes.  Something like marshamllow or vanilla swirl is about \"creamy\" as i'd get with this, and the selective muting in those flavors should help mellow out the florals here a bit.\n\n**Notes:**  This is really strong stuff. I get the full dose of those floral top notes at .25%.  The base is definitely sweet, but it doesn't quite cross the line into syrupy and there's a nice tartness to it. .5% is much more syrupy, and some of the bite of the florals is balanced out by that deeper sweetness.  1% is pretty overwhelmingly sweet for me, and it's getting a bit darker and caramelized. Florals aren't necessarily stronger, but they do seem to picking up a bit of that fresh laundry vibe.  At 3%, this is surprisingly un-terrible. Really heavy and sweet, and the florals don't really get perfumey so much as they get really green and leafy.  It does get really plastic-y for me this high though, so I probably wouldn't recommend trying to roll over the odometer on this and making it work again higher.\n\nQuick comparison to the other Lychees I've tried, this is probably my favorite of the bunch. CAP Sweet Lychee is okay, and may be quite a bit easier to mix with. It's much less floral than this, and it's a pretty decent candy lychee if a bit boring. FA Lychee isn't quite as sweet, and the florals there come across more chemical and have a bit of hairspray to them. FA Lychee has a sticky mouthfeel too, but it's more a weird grape jelly sticky as opposed to the heavier syrup of the FLV. And before /u/ID10-T chimes in here, FE Lychee is apparently awesome. He said as much in the comments for my review of FA Lychee, and [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/3hozk7/dear_diehard_lychee_fans/) would seem to confirm that.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Here's an older FOTW covering Lychee.

It actually does a great job of representing a MACAROON. The \"off\" flavor I was tasting I can now pinpoint as coconut. Sorry for any confusion!  \n*Summary*  \nKind of an odd flavoring. I feel like this is FLV's answer to \"Cookie.\" It's got a bit of texture, but not as much texture or dryness as you might expect from a macaroon or a cookie. I find it gets weird on me over 1.5% (~~almost smokey?~~ *EDIT: Coconut, maybe toasted coconut?*). Below that, it does provide a nice sort of nutty, cookie-like dryness to a recipe. It's definitely an accent. I single flavor tested this at 2% and am not a fan (~~not good, not bad~~ *EDIT: Good as a macaroon, bad as a macaron*), but I did enjoy how it accented certain aspects of mixes. Certainly not an end-all-be-all cookie, but it's an interesting nutty dry accent to bakeries or cookies. Kind of reminds me of a diluted INW Biscuit + FA Cookie. ~~I want to say I detect vanilla or something but it's such a mild tone it's hard to pick up on it~~ *EDIT: It's coconut*. \n\n**On the Nose**  \nDry, nutty, plastic or vanilla or something, having a tough time describing this aspect of the aroma (EDIT: It's coconut). \n\n**Recommended Usage**  \n*Stand alone*: 1.5%\n\n*In a mix*: <.5-1.25%\n\n**Throat**  \nNone; mild.\n\n**Pairings**  \nNuts, cookies, caramels, butterscotches, maybe tobacco *EDIT: Marshmallow is good too*\n\n**Avoid**  \nHard to say, I'd say leave it out of recipes that aren't \"bakery\"\n\n**Steep**  \n2-3 Days\n\n**Quick Recipe: Pecan Pie Filling**  \n*Ratio: 10PG/90VG*  \n*Steep: 3 days* \n\n* FLV Pralines @ 2.25%\n* FLV Macaroon @ 1.25%\n* FLV Vanilla Custard @ 1.5%\n* FLV Caramel @ 1% \n\nWhat this flavoring does really well here is accent the nuttiness of the pralines as well providing some texture to the pecans, and giving a sort of dry, cookie-like base ~~for a crust~~. You can see here it does bring some texture, but may need some help from other ingredients to bring a crust flavor/texture more forward if that's what you're looking for. \n\n*Please if your opinion differs, or you have another review for this post it in the comments.

It could be the power of suggestion, but I do get s slight hit of a yeast-risen donut.  Something a little bit more complex than a dryer cake donut.  Maple shows up on the exhale but it's really subtle as far as maple goes.  Very much a maple frosting and not an actual, from a tree, maple note. The exhale has more of that slightly yeasty fluffy bread texture and taste. Maple segregates itself to the beginning of the exhale.  Tail end is more of that bready donut taste.  Not oily, just fluffy.  Tastes a bit flat, but not bad for a single concentrate.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Bakery fluffyness can get a bit cardboard-y on the tail end of the exhale.  Not pronounced, but this stuff will dry your mouth out a bit after a big exhale.   \n\n**Throat Hit:** 2/10.  Not much \"harshness\" although the dryness does have a weird effect after vaping it for a while.\n\n**Uses:**  Pretty adequate single use flavor.  Probably better with a bit of added maple or other frosting flavor and maybe a little added richness.  If you aren't just going \"maple bar,\" then added volume in bakeries where a slight hit of maple isn't going to throw the entire recipe off.  Filled donuts that can stand some maple.\n\n**Pairings:**  Something like CAP Buttercream for added richness. I think dryer rich bakeries would compound the dryness issue here so I'd stick to just the butter and not the whole pastry. FA Joy would probably fry and sweeten the donut a bit. Maple, obvs. Butterscotch or Carmel could take the frosting in some interesting directions. Jammy darker fruits or custards may do a decent job of filling the donut.\n\n**Notes:** I'd like to see this without the maple.  It's not a bad maple flavor, just flat and subtle.  Without that maple, it's a pretty effective, if dry, yeast risen donut texture waiting for whatever else you want to throw at it.  And I do love that yeast-risen vibe, especially refreshing given the powdery cake-y note on other donut concentrates.\n\n[DIY_eJuice flavor reviews!](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)",

Moderately fluffy malty inhale with a dry medium sweet exhale.  Not quite a vanilla note on the exhale.  I wouldn't call it marshmallow exactly, either. It doesn't taste overtly artificial, just odd.  Higher wattage and heat doesn't really help this out or make the concentrate work any better, it just pushes the off flavors higher in the mix and makes them stronger.\n\n**Off-flavors:** The krispies part of this has a strong cardboard vibe.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Milk @ 1% and 1 drop per 10 ml (about .25%), 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 9 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Heavier than straight milk, more like a flat cream flavor with some buttery and malty notes.  Under .5%, good hit of dairy flavor without tasting buytric or rancid, and stands up to higher heat pretty well. Dense texture, but not fluffy like a whipped cream.  At 1% that dairy gets a bit heavy and the maltiness gets a bit nutty, and the entire thing tastes like it's right on the verge or souring. I'd call it closer to a clotted cream up higher. Does a good job of tasting dense and rich with no DAAP, according to the [Flavorah GCMS](http://www.flavorah.com/wp-content/uploads/safety/flavorah_milk_gcms.pdf].  I'd use this an accent to add some richness and dairy realism to thinner creams like FA Fresh Cream at .1%-.4%.\n\nInhale is buttery, with a weird touch of sharpness in the top notes. Dense, but flat, with a lightly malty/nutty dairy note. A little bit sweet, but not like a full on sweetened whipped cream. Exhale is fairly flat, with that buttery cream up front, and some malty notes that get nutty as you increase the percentage. Exhale is just as dense as the inhale, and it seems to really coat your palate.  Lingers on quite a bit after vaping it.\n\n**Off-flavors:** I get a touch of a black licorice / anise to this, but it's pretty subtle under 1%.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light, but it comes and goes.  Kind of lodges in your throat a bit, if that makes any sense with vapor at all.  It's not really harsh, but it seems to kind of build up and get a bit dry.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This should have some interesting applications.  The easiest is to add some realism to wetter, thinner cream flavors.  It should work a lot like FW Hazelnut to add some malt back into a cereal recipe, with some added richness.\n\nI think the fact this gets sour but not rancid may also work in something like a cheesecake recipe, especially when you're trying to replicate something slightly savory like a sour cream cheesecake.\n\n**Notes:**  This is on the strong side of things.  I made a dilution of this for S&V concentration testing. At .1%, I get some milder malty and buttery notes, without a ton of heavier base. At .2%, you've got a good deal of buttery dense body, and that maltiness is getting more solid.  At .3%, this is closer to a heavy cream flavor, with that maltiness getting a bit sour.  Most real dairy has a touch of that sour note, and here it isn't unpleasant so much as realistic. .4% is pretty intense for me.  Thick, buttery, and just a bit nutty and sour. .5% may actually taste a little too realistic for me, and I'm getting a bit of a anise type of spice here. 1% is dense, buttery, and nutty. It tastes like it right on the edge of souring.  Just for laughs, I tried this at 2% and it wasn't working for me that high. It's nutty, sour, and a bit too rich.  I'd use this an accent at .1-.4%.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nNot a whole lot\n\n[ELR page is pretty sparse.

Works very nicely in the base of a recipe as the sweet cream, as long as that dark sweetness plays well with the other elements. One thing I like about this flavoring is its uniqueness and it's fairly forgiving as long it's paired well, so you can come up with some interesting recipes using it.\n\n**On the Nose**  \nCream with a hint of caramel or some dark sweetness.\n\n**Recommended Usage**  \n*Stand alone*: 3%\n\n*In a mix*: 1-2%. \n\n**Throat**  \nMild to Moderate\n\n**Ideal Pairings**  \nOther creams, nuts, caramel, butterscotch, caramel, banana, cinnamon, vanilla, bakeries\n\n**Avoid**  \nBright fruits, citrus\n\n**Steep**  \n3-5 days.\n\n**Recipe Idea: [Banana Cream w/ Cinnamon Crumble](https://alltheflavors.com/my/recipes/1492)**  \n*Ratio: 15PG/85VG*  \n*Steep: 5+ days* \n\n**Ingredient**|**%**|\n:--|:--|\nTFA Banana Cream|3%|\nFLV Butterscotch|1%|\nCAP Graham Cracker|2%|\nFLV Milk & Honey|1.5%|\nFLV Cinnamon Crunch|1.5%|\nHS Banana|0.75%|\nFLV Cream|0.75%|\n\n\nIn this recipe, the Milk & Honey is serving as the main component of the cream base, as well as a base for a dark sweetness to be built upon. It plays really well with the butterscotch here, and pairs really well with banana. Try mixing Milk & Honey with nuts/peanut butter and you'll probably dig the outcome too.\n\n**Edit:** Looking through some of my old notes, I think my [Milk & Honey](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/13546#milk_honey_by_cheebasteeba) really showcases this flavoring a lot more than the recipe I originally presented.

Full Cotton Wicks.  \n\n**Steep Time:**  3 days\n\n**Percentages Tested:** .25%, 1%, 3%\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Champagne and oranges. Seems to start off a bit disjointed with sort of an off-putting overripe flavor, like smelling a moldy orange or prison wine.  It settles in surprisingly quickly though and I get a clearer separation between the champagne and the orange flavors.  \n\nThat initial burst of orange zest mellows out and actually seems to sweeten up to something doing a pretty passable job of orange juice, although there's a lot going on in the champagne side of things and maybe gets a bit lost.  \n\nChampagne note here does seem to have a bit of fermented funk and maybe something like a bitter mineral tang that makes this it a bit rough solo, but seems pretty accurate to a something like Cook's.  Not great champagne, but at least recognizable as champagne.  Decent effervescence-ish effect, especially at higher percentages, but that champagne note starts to taste astringent and too aggressive pretty quickly.\n\nSweetness level maybe leans towards a heavier pour on the orange juice, but the champagne flavor is in the drivers seat, which is a bit odd.  Almost like you made a mimosa with an aggressively flavored prosecco.  I'm not incredibly sensitive to throat hit, but this does have some pretty standard throatiness to it.\n\n**Concentration testing:**  At .25%, the lightness of the flavor actually works pretty well to sell a sense of a lighter mimosa. I'm not getting much in the way of orange down here, but there is some of the sweetness you'd expect.  Champagne funk is relatively mellow, but I'm also not getting much underlying flavor from it.  Seems a bit too light.\n\nAt 1%, I'm struggling a bit with that weirdness from the champagne. It's already starting to taste a little bit astringent and over bearing. Almost has a carrot-skin, rhubarb kind of vibe to it.  Beyond that pretty aggressive note up front, the rest of this is actually still pretty pleasant and mild. Decent carbonation. Orange is a bit clearer.  That weirdness does settle in a bit, but probably still a bit too intense, at least solo.  I've noticed it's weirder after a fresh drip, so maybe I'm just getting too much flavor at once out of this.\n\nAt 3%, that goes straight bitter vegetable peel on the top notes.  A little harsher. Orange underneath this is still good, and I'm getting more of that mineral tang from the champagne.  I'd like to be able to mix this high, but I have no idea how to get around that funk.\n\nI'd probably use this as an accent around .5-.75% percent, maybe increasing it up to 1-1.5% if the flavor around it works well enough with the weirdness here.\n\n**Pairings & Uses?**  I'm having issues getting enough flavor out of the base of this while still trying to keep that funk in control.  I think I'm going to use this primarily as an additive to citrus cocktail mixes, and basically crank it up as far as the surrounding flavors will let me.  This might be \"mimosa-ish\" enough to use it as a bridge flavor to tie together another champagne flavor and maybe FA Blood and/or Royal Orange into a fuller mimosa.  I'd also want to add some cooling, because cold things should probably be cold. \n\nI could also see this working as a base for a citrus punch flavor or even like a mountain dew flavor.  Carbonation is about as there as it ever is, and maybe some more aggressive citrus will clean up that funk.\n\nThat funkier flavor should either blend, or at least not call to much attention to itself alongside a bunch of gin, so cocktails.  All of the cocktails. Good excuse to use up some of the Flavormonks gins if you have them.\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Moscato, .25, 1, and 3%, others noted, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 5 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Sweet white grape.  I'm not getting much in the way of booze out of this, but it's a pretty solid, bright white grape flavor. I'd probably use more in a interesting fruit mix, but I think it would make some really solid sweeter champagne flavors with some additional help.\n\nThe white grape here reminds me a lot of less floral FA White Grape. It has that same sort of sweet, bright, and almost sticky grape note. Very bright, with some slightly sharp lychee notes to it. The florals here, at least 5 days out are pretty mild and they don't do the hairspray thing that FA White Grape does.\n\nThis doesn't really taste boozy to me, at least not a recognizable wine boozy.  There is a bit of a greener note to the back end of this gets a little of a wine astringency but it stops short of the profile for me.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  This gets a little green when you start to push it. Closer to 3% I'm getting something that tastes a lot like INW Rhubarb in the mix.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light.  Just a bit of throat hit, but nothing too aggressive or out of line for a fruit flavor.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At .25%, I'm getting a clear white grape flavor. It's not all that vibrant, it's a bit light overall, and maybe a bit floral. Feels undersaturated at this percentage.\n\nAt 1%, this is quite a bit brighter. I'm getting a fuller, juicy mouthfeel.  Definitely getting white grapes.  There's a bit of a lychee floral note to it, but overall it's a clear, solid white grape. I'm not finding too much in way of a boozy wine note, the finish has just a bit of an astringency that kind of evokes a desert wine though.\n\nAt 3%, the grape is strong and bright, but I feel like that astringency has crossed over into something more like a green, bright rhubarb note. At least solo, the astringency is starting to push this flavor in a weird direction.  It seems to be moving away from just a white grape, but I dig how weird it's getting.  That's pretty personal though.\n\nJust based on these tests, I'd probably keep this around 1.5% as a primary note unless you want to chase that interesting green note.  This is pretty present at low percentages, and should work as an accent note at around .5%.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:** I think this could be taken in a more wine-forward direction.  I'd want just a bit more sourness and booze of it, so maybe pairing with something like FA White Wine.  I think it might be easier to make a sparkling moscato or even a prosecco using one of the champagne flavors.  FW Pink Champagne has a pretty heavy \"carbonation\" effect, and the grape there is going work well for a sparkling wine. You could also probably pair this a bit of FA Brandy for a boozier reddish wine.  Also should blend well with FLV Sangria for a similar effect.\n\nAs a straight fruit flavor, this should work as a fairly realistic white grape when mixed with other fruits.  I'd pair with apples, strawberries, and melon particulary.  I also think it could work well with some citrus like oranges or limes.  I know FLV just put out a Sangria, but I think this would make a better chilled sangria base.  Since this seems to have a bit of INW rhubarb thing going, I also want to throw raspberries at it.\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

    "markdown": "*I recently got word directly from Flavorah that their flavs are designed to be good as a shake n vape. I personally have noticed that they are indeed great early on in the steep. Tobacco heads should be particularly pleased by this knowledge, considering we're used to steeping our baccos as long as it takes to age a good single malt scotch whiskey.*\n\n**Specs:**\n\n- percentage used: 5%\n- 4 day steep \n- PG/VG ratio: 50/50\n- vaped on Digiflavor Siren GTA MTL, SS316L, 26 gauge, 0.60 ohm coil, 12-18 watts\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Flavor Properties:**\n\n- roll your own type tobacco\n- full body\n- lightly sweet, spicy\n- spice adds brightness, while the sweet note smooths out the overall profile\n- medium complexity\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Relatable Flavors:**\n\n- tastes like how fresh, lightly aromatic tobacco smells\n- spicy tobacco leaf\n- touch of honey on the exhale\n- medium ash\n- when smelling the juice in bottle I get subtle nut, like Acetyl Pyrazine, it does not jump out at you when vaping but I believe it's hiding under the spice and honey, adding body to the profile\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Mouth Feel:**\n\n- medium/thick density\n- sharp (spice note) on the inhale, smooth on the exhale with spice moving to the background\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:**\n\n- none\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Position In A Recipe:**\n\n- top note or middle note\n- makes a great focal point in a recipe, even as a top note, it could be the star of the show\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Pairings:**\n\n- dark tobaccos (cigar, burley)\n- strong tobaccos (perique, latakia)\n- other spicy tobaccos (INW Am4a, FLV Kentucky Blend)\n- Irish Cream (Might make angel's sing, no promises but could be what clouds in heaven taste like. Pretty sure though.)\n- dark, rich vanilla (example: Vanilla Bourbon of your choice)\n- fig, raisin, plum, prune (to mimic that note many of us smell in fresh tobacco)\n- dry nut (example: FLV Pistachio)\n- Acetyl Pyrazine (like 0.25%)\n- cream\n- custard\n- bonus: citrus flavor like a bright orange would take it in a completely different direction and might add that 'je ne sais quoi\" to a mix\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Suggested Percentage:**\n\n- 3-5% for full on bold flavor \n- 1% or less for top note.\n- I've recently tried upping FLV tobaccos to a whopping 8% and the flavors hold true. If you like it extra bold, you can certainly take it there without causing weird off notes.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- Oh ya, she's a keeper.\n- Consider this a cousin of Kentucky Blend. Fairly similar I'd say. Native Tobacco is a bit sweeter with that honey note. I'm glad I own both. Will have to try pairing them.\n- Very, very vapeable as a single flavor but this baby will be great for spicing up a dark tobacco.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Suggested Recipe:**\n\n- have only spent an hour or so with the flav but I'm gonna work on a roll your own type recipe. Native Tobacco front and centre, dark rich tobacco in the background, fig/plum/raisin/or prune as a top note, and maybe a lil INW Dirty Neutral Base to dirty up the mix.",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Nectarine, .25, 1, and 3%, others noted, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 4 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  A top-heavy brighter stone fruit flavor, somewhere between a white peach and an actual nectarine.  Harsh, and with a generous helping of off-notes, though.\n\nThe actual nectarine flavor is pretty solid. It's definitely a bit tarter than a straight peach flavor, with an almost citrus kind of brightness to it.  Feels like there's a bit of peel in here, which isn't really the usual for a peach-ish flavor and it works pretty well. Light earthiness and some spice on that peel.  The brightness in here is nice, and works to really delineate this from a peach.\n\nThis doesn't really have the mouthfeel of a nectarine. Texture is pretty substantially dry.  I basically get bright and tart, then dry.  Doesn't seem to have a whole lot of juicy or fleshy body to it.\n\nI'm getting a pretty aggressive throat hit out of this.  I'm not incredibly sensitive to throat hit, but this definitely has a solid punch to it.\n\nThe off-notes here are a bummer, because this pretty interesting. They taste like the plastic-y side of the traditional cherry off-note spectrum.  They are also fairly aggressive in here.  Doesn't really have the body to go full medicinal.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Plastic, almost benzene, wollop of off-flavors through the entire vape. Also an aggressive dryness that pulls it off profile.\n\n**Throat Hit:** I'd call it pretty solidly harsh.  It's aggressive.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At .25% solo, there is some brighter nectarine flavor in here. Not a whole lot of body here, but just that bright nectarine top note. Off flavors are still there, but they are relatively subdued compared to higher percentages, I'd still call them fairly prominent.  Not too much harshness here, but the flavor is thin.\n\nAt 1% solo, this actually has a pretty solid, bright nectarine top note. That brightness is really starting to pop and get interesting. Those off notes are getting pretty aggressive though.   Seems a bit dry overall, and that throat hit is intense.\n\nAt 3% solo, this feels like more off flavors than than the good stuff. Plastic is getting a bit acrid.  Harshness is harsh, man.  I don't know, this isn't coming together for me.\n\nBased on this testing, I'd keep this lower as an accent. Maybe .5-1%.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This one didn't really click with me.  From failing to make cherry flavors not garbage, I've never really found a good way around those kind of plastic off-notes.  The harshness and dryness could be dealt with in a lot of ways from a maltol heavy fruit like TPA Ripe Strawberry, maybe some of the triethyl citrate from TPA Dragonfruit, or just straight EM.  You could also look at creams, marshmallows, or something with a heavy hit of triacetin.  But those plastic flavors, man.  I haven't figured out a good way to get rid of them, and they seem to show up pretty aggressively even at lower percentages.\n\nIf you don't mind those plastic flavors, this would be a good bright accent for peaches, plums, or other stone fruit.  Would actually work well with bright fruit like strawberries, oranges, pineapple or kiwi as well.\n\nMaybe this is just a case of something not working for me, but it's a shame because this smells great, both in the bottle and the room note is fantastic.\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Oak Barrel, .25, 1, and 3%, others noted, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 7 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  An uncharred oak additive.\n\nThis tastes a lot like smelling hardwood. Nothing like cedar or sandalwood.  Also nothing resinous or like pine. No char to it either.  Basically just clean oak.\n\nThis has no body to it solo.  It's mostly just a light, dry, astringency with some clean oak top notes.\n\nAs an addtive, it adds that clean oak top note, but it also seems to give a tannic dryness to underlying mix.  It doesn't seem to have any real effect on sweetness or density, but it does add an extra layer of contrast which makes brighter flavor pop a bit more.  It seems to sharpen and tone the mix around it quite a bit.\n\nI'm not getting a distinct change in sweetness, throat hit, or density of the underlying mix.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Not a solo flavor.  It's definitely an additive. It also isn't the charred bourbon oak you'd maybe expect. But yeah, it could conceivably taste like an actual oak barrel.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light solo, doesn't seem to be adding too much in the way of throat hit in mixes.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  Solo testing with this was weird.\n\nAt .25% solo, I don't pick up much.  There is a light dryness here and some uncharred hardwood in the top notes.  No body, and not much going on in general.\n\nAt 1% solo, there is more of that same uncharred oak.  I'm not really picking up more dryness.  A little bit of sweetness, but still no real body.\n\nAt 3% solo, I'm picking up a tiny hint of char but it's really light. It's more like smelling lumber than the charred oak from a bourbon. Still no real presence, and a overall very light sweetness. I could be hallucinating, but it has a bit of a vanilla vibe as well.\n\nThis definitely isn't a solo flavor, so here are some additive tests.\n\nAt .5% FLV Oak Barrel and 3% TPA Kentucky Bourbon, this definitely lends some of the missing oak back to Kentucky Bourbon, but it's interesting. It still doesn't really taste charred here.  There's maybe something a little bit more smoky here, but i think it's coming from the bourbon itself instead of the oak barrel.  I don't think is supposed to be a charred oak flavor, I think it's more of just an oak hardwood flavor.\n\nAt 1% FLV Oak Barrel and 2% DIYFS Holy Vanilla, it's pretty clear this isn't a charred oak bourbon flavor. It's adding some more of that hardwood oak flavor. It's mostly in the top notes, but it does add a bit of tannic astringency and dryness through the vape. The darker, spicier parts of the vanilla are a little lost and the contrast with the brighter frosting-type of vanilla is pushing that forward quite a bit.  It tastes like eating lucky charms marshmallows in a lumber yard, which is super interesting but probably not something to run with.\n\nI don't really have a good red wine flavor to test with, but .25% FLV Oak Barrel with 2% FLV Sangria is interesting.  It's doing some weird things with brightening the fruit and brandy up, but it is sort of taking that flat red wine note in there closer to a cabernet with a woody astringency.  I'm pretty comfortable with saying that this is more of a wine oak barrel flavor as opposed to a charred bourbon oak barrel flavor.\n\nJust based on these tests, I feel like this is an addtive flavor, and my suggested use percentage would be fairly low because it seems to show up pretty quickly, despite how mellow this flavor seems as a single test.  I'd probably start around .25% and work up.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This seems like a pretty specialized flavor, but it isn't the only oak out there.\n\nPrimary competition here would be FA Oak Wood and TPA Red Oak.  Red oak has a bit of sourness to me, and it has a definite coconut husk kind of character.  There's a light smoke to it as well.  I wouldn't say it's fully charred, but it's definitely more charred than FLV Oak Barrel.  FA Oakwood is quite a bit sweeter, but doesn't seem to have much char.  It has a thinner, watery body to it. I'd say that Oak Barrel is probably the least complex of the concentrates, just bringing in that oak aged taste without any real extra body or sweetness.  For what it's worth, it isn't markedly different, just a bit more targeted.  It may not end up being essential if you already have an oak flavor you dig, but conversely, it's an interesting switchup if you want to go further down that rabbit hole.  Based on the same percentages in a mix, FLV Oak Barrel seems to be stronger than the oak note in FA Oak Wood and TPA Red Oak.\n\nOakwood and Red Oak are used pretty extensively as tobacco additives, and this would do largely the same in a mix.  I'd go so far as to say Oak Barrel will work a bit better if you just want an oak enhancer / additive without bringing in the baggage from the (fairly minimal) body present in those two.\n\nI think Red Oak still probably has the edge in custards and creams.  That coconut in there is going to work to boost and richen up the creamy, heavier body.\n\nOak wood may still be the choice for liquor, as that sweetness tends to fill out dark liquors.  If you want a charred oak note, like you'd get in a bourbon, FLV Bourbon has a very aggressive charred oak that comes through clearly at low accent percentages.\n\nI'd use FLV Oak Barrel like an oak barrel for wine type flavors. Seems to do a good job emulating the oak in a cabernet-ish wine and I feel like it would work similarly with a white wine to push it towards chardonnay. It did seem to add some contrast with fruitier flavors, so I'd either embrace that or get ready to mix around it. Good excuse to try to barrel age those cocktail mixes you've been working on.\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Exhale has some lingering zest notes, left over from that slightly sharp inhale.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Bit of a waxy mouthfeel, especially at high percentages.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light, especially compared to other citrus.\n\n**Uses:** Rounding out harsher citruses.  EM will sort of saw off a lot of your top notes, while this should give the entire orange a fleshier aspect while leaving those top notes in there.  Flatter citrus will blend well in heavier recipes.  Pretty good base for an orange candy with that fuller, duller flavor.  Tropical fruit juices or smoothies would be great, as this is mellow enough to let some other flavors shine though.\n\n**Pairings:**  Low percentages of bright citrus to give you some top notes back.  Good excuse to use harsh citrus as an accent.  Should pair well with creams and bakeries. Cactus for some juiciness. Bright fruits, especially strawberry.  Natural fit for spice or tea flavors. The lack of harsh top notes will let those kind of floral or more aggressive spice notes shine.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nWith regards to percentage use, this seems to be really linear up to 6%, with that 6% giving you a pretty unmistakeable citrus feeling.  If you chase a straight orange flavor, the wax and weird structure of the flavor are going to catch up with you before get anything like a full orange.  I'd mix 4-5% for a citrus mix, and I'd stay at around 2-3% for a supporting flavor in a non-citrus dominant mix.\n\nOverall, the cost here is the biggest issue. With that said, this has a place if you are looking for an interesting citrus component well suited for flavor blends.\n\nShoutout to /u/apexified for sending this my way for review.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[/u/botboy141/ 's writeup on orange citrus is good.

Some cedar notes are present. This tobacco flavor has low or no ash content, making it great to use in a flavor profile where you want a crisp tobacco note, but not the heavy ash, or spice of darker tobaccos.” I don’t personally get the nutty (maybe I’m turning in to a nutty mute?) and I do get a hint of some spice. Maybe the cedar note I’m picking up as spice. I think this makes a great base to build a Turkish Blend on. I prefer to use this with a little bit of HS Elder Captain over FLV Turkish. Their Turkish gets a bit weird for me. The tobacco in the Oriental is a crisp and bright Tobacco, not completely different than their Cured or Native. Not smoky or ashy really. It’s got some pretty nice body to it. It could probably work as a stand-alone around 2%, but I like to keep it around 1-1.5% and build on top of it. \n\n**Off flavors:** Some of the FLV tobaccos give me a weird laundromat taste when I take them too high. I don’t think this is very common, but I know that it at least happens to a guy I work with. But at 1.5% it’s not really noticeable, and I mix with it closer to 1-1.25%, and don’t pick it up in a mix. But FLV usually doesn’t require enough to bring out any of those off notes. \n\n**Pairings:** Throw Some Spices in with it. Some Fig or raisin. Goes really well with that raisin smell from a fresh pack (I use INW Fortuna Strike.) I imagine it would play nicely with some fruits. Maybe some Wood Spice if you want to exploit that cedar note and get really woodsy. \n\n**Second Opinions:** For some reason I couldn’t really find any other notes on it. Not sure why, I think it’s probably one of my favorites from FLV. Anyone got any second opinions?\n\nI suppose since there’s no second opinions and only 2 public recipes for it on ATF, I’ll throw out my [Turkish for Pipe](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/share/86979349-b73b-4899-b85f-4961bf47ce6c) recipe just to give some more ideas on how to use it. \n\n[DIY_Ejuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)",

More than a little astringent. Decent sweetness.  A strong clear flavor though that's fairly light on the palette.  Tastes like a peach flavor smirnoff-caliber vodka.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Sort of lingering bitter taste.  Not a rubber or plastic note, numbs my mouth a bit. Not obnoxiously prominent, but it's there. After vaping for a while it kind of builds into a gummy aftertaste.\n\n**Throat Hit:** 3/10. Pretty darn smooth all things considered.  \n\n**Uses:**  Would make a good basis for a gummy peach ring flavor with someone to enhance gummy mouth-feel.  Most fruit candies actually.  Thinner, non-dairy beverages like soda or cocktails.  I can't imagine it going well with thicker dairy notes, but it may useful for punching up the high notes on a tropical or peach milkshake.\n\n**Pairings:**  Your typical tropical nonsense. Any brighter fruit flavor.  Peaches. I'd stay away from heavy dark flavors unless you had something middle of the road acting like a bridge between the high notes here and a deeper base note.\n\n**Notes:**  If you told my this was an all in one cheap peach gummy rings flavor, I would probably believe you.  Doesn't really nail the papaya or the punch.  Given the name I was expecting a much richer fruityness.  It does have a light mouthfeel that might lend itself to beverage profiles and could probably be used effectively as a top note in mixes.",

It's subtle though.\n\n**Throat Hit:** 7/10. Relatively harsh for how muted the flavor is.\n\n**Uses:**  The relative dryness of this concentrate may be an asset.  It would work as unobtrusive background noise for a tropical flavor.

Would add an interesting note for a brighter fruit like cherry, raspberry, or strawberry.\n\n**Notes:**  Kind of reminds me of a lighter version of TFA Mango.  It's a slightly earthy duller flavor. It kind of felt like my wicks weren't broken in even after dripping 15ml of it.  I like it more than FA Passion Fruit, if only because it doesn't have some of the medicinal, perfumy notes and it seems more forgiving.  CAP Passion Fruit is still my favorite for a juicy passion fruit.  I'm not going to call it useless, but It it isn't a main note and It isn't a fantastic backup either.  ",

    "markdown": "*This a a pre-release flavor, which was provided to me solely for the purposes of review.*\n\n**Setup:** Recoil w/ flavor barrel, Dual 15 wrap 26g 3mm Nifethal 70 coils @.16 ohms.  60w power, 450F temp limit. Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Flavorah Pastry Zest, .25, 1, and 3%, others noted, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 8 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  I'm thinking this is another additive.  Seems to have a tart note, not entirely unlike [FLV Pucker](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/6ztgqk/flv_pucker/), but without any of that tobacco / coumarin baggage and something more like lemon juice than tannins.  There's also some kind of sugary note to this with maybe a hint of cinnamon. I don't taste much if any pastry/bakery base here.  As you start to increase the percentage the sugar note moves from just sweetness, to a powdered sugar, and then to a grittier granulated sugar.\n\nSaying lemon anywhere near the word bakery gets people instantly worked about something like the mystery lemon that ends up in most flavourart bakeries, but the tartness here isn't a lemon zest flavor.  It's just a tartness like lemon juice without any of the flavor or real acidity.  Mixed, it translates over pretty directly on top other bakeries.  It doesn't seem to be doing too much to blend into the actual bakeries. It's prominent enough that it's a bit distracting with a straight bakery flavor just because you get that tart then the bakery.  It doesn't cross over to acidic for me, and it doesn't seem to have an effect on the underlying flavor like malic and citric acid does, at least after a week steep.\n\nThe sugar here adds some really interesting texture. It's at the back of the flavor, and seems to be sweetening up the bakeries I've mixed this without really affecting the underlying texture plus adding some of it's own.  At lower percentages, it's more like a powdered sugar. Really fine graininess with a bit of added warmth and a solid hit of sweetness. As you start increasing percentage, the sugar seems to be getting coarser and getting more of a \"rolled in granulated sugar\" type of vibe.  It feels like there is some kind of cinnamon in there, but it's definitely on the light side. More of just the warmth and not a bolder, savory cinnamon.  The sugar part of this also seems to sit on top of a mix a bit, but that's probably a good thing in this case, adding another layer of sweetness and texture.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  That tartness doesn't seem to really blend in with other bakeries.  It's adding a bit of tartness just right on top of my mixed samples.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Seems to bump up throat hit in mixes just a bit. Nothing too intense.\n\n**Percentage testing:** At .25% Solo, i don't get much out of this. Maybe some light tartness, and a pretty non-specific sweetness.\n\nAt 1% solo, this is a bit more present. Clear tartness on the inhale and the beginning of the exhale. Back half of the exhale is mostly powdered sugar, with a bit of a dry, fluffy texture.\n\nAt 3% solo, this actually doesn't taste a whole lot more tart than 1%, although it does seem to be picking up a bit of an actual lemon flavor. The sugar note seems to be scaling up, getting a grittier texture, and getting a bit sweeter. I'm also picking up some kind of light bakery cinnamon, but it doesn't seem anywhere close to the robustness of FLV Rich Cinnamon.  There's not really a bakery taste, but more of a bakery volume underneath.  Actually tastes a lot like those [weird cinnamon twist things from taco bell.](https://www.tacobell.com/food/dollar-cravings/cinnamon-twists)\n\nAt .25% with 4% FW Yellow Cake, this isn't really working.  The tartness doesn't really brighten up the cake so much as sit on top of it.  I knew this was probably a stretch when mixing it, but this isn't really made for fluffier softer bakeries. The additional powdered sugar helps to firm up the frosting a bit, which is nice though.\n\nAt 1% with 2% FA Zeppola, it's a bit better. I'm still finding the tartness a bit overwhelming and not really blending all that well, but that powdered sugar note is definitely reinforcing that powdered sugar I already get from zeppola over 1%.\n\nAt 2% with 3% FA Apple Pie, this makes a lot more sense. FA Apple Pie doesn't have a lot of fruit to it, but what is there is definitely perked up by that tartness.  It's also sweetening up that crust note without really affecting the flaky texture.\n\nSo as an accent, I think the limiting factor here is going to be that tartness.  2% seems a bit too tart for me, I'd probably stay around 1-1.5%.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I think this is going to require a mix with both fruit and a flaky pastry to really be successful.  That tart note stands apart from the bakery base. Because it's all frontloaded on the vape, it shouldn't effect the texture of pastry all that much.  The tartness will help to pick up some of the fruit in the mix though.\n\nI'm thinking pies, tarts, cobblers, and other fruit forward bakeries. You could probably use this with fruit filled bakeries, but I'd watch the layering in those recipes. Generally something fruit filled leads with the pastry, this isn't really going to cooperate with that. You'll want fruit up front, than pastry on the back end.\n\nThe tartness here is neutral enough that I don't think there are too many fruits it won't work with.\n\nAnd hey, if you have a citrus bakery like a key lime or lemon meringue pie, go nuts.  Those generally don't have cinnamon, but the lighter cinnamon here shouldn't be too overwhelming and is more of a warmth than an aggressive cinnamon note.\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Moderate sweetness here, but still very airy. Lingering peel notes.  The only thing I'm missing is some juicy body and punch to this.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Nope.

This is a bit vague, but I'm pretty convinced this will work damn near anywhere you want a peach as long as you account for the thinness here.\n\nIf you are interested in a fuller peach, a low percentage of INW Peach for extra body and maybe just a bit of INW Cactus.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nWell covered on reddit, just lacking the single flavor review.

Just a bit on the the astringent boozy side solo.  Soft candy peach with some light bitterness, and a full gummy base that's lacking some of the almost chewy density of a peach ring.  Obviously useful for peach rings, but also as an accent in candy mango, or thicker peach fillings in bakeries. Linear mixer, Use up to 3% as  primary flavor and around 1% as an accent.\n\nInhale is dense with a candy peach flavor. Some sharper tartness, but it's less noticeable as you increase the percentage.  Full gummy mouthfeel with some pretty tangible stickiness to it. Exhale has soft candy peach up front.  Not a ton of top notes, maybe a tiny bit of a bitter edge to it, no real floral component. Base is full, but not quite dense.  Sticky gummy mouthfeel. Candy sweetness, but not overwhelming at 3% and under.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Solo, this has a bit of a astringent note to it overall, pretty common with gummy flavors. Doesn't seem to show up when it's mix with heavier flavors though.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Light. It's not in the same universe as Juicy Peach.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This is fairly close to a standalone peach rings flavor, but a little help isn't a bad thing. In the second opinions there are references to mixing this with INW Peach, and I think that pairing would be great to really fill in the peach here. Also, for the gummy base, traditionally it's a bit thicker and chewier than something like a gummi bear, so I'd look at some TPA Marshmallow to thicken it up.\n\nOutside the obvious peach rings thing, I think this has potential to work in sweeter and thicker peach applications like peach bakeries and maybe even peaches and cream.\n\nCandy peaches and candy mango flavors have (for me at least) a lot of similarities, so I've used this to back up mango flavors in candies.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, this seems pretty linear. This is definitely present, but fairly thin and just a bit astringent down at .25%. .5% is largely the same, with maybe a bit fuller peach flavor and the astringency is closer to a gummi flavor. 1% has a pretty full peach flavor, with some gummy mouthfeel. Overall effect is still just a bit astringent and almost boozy.  1.5% is fuller, and I'm losing a good deal of that astringent edge but there is still a bit of bitterness. Peach feels even more candied and it's losing some tartness.  2% is sweeter, dense, and a bit flat. Definitely peach rings.  3% is getting a bit harsh and oversweet for me personally, but it's still pretty linear. 4% is getting harsh for me, and that peach is getting pretty indistinct and flat. I'd recommend using this a peach ring flavor with some backup at 3%, and as a backup to thicken other peach flavors anywhere between .5 and 1.5% depending on how thick and sweet you want that peach.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Here's a post by /u/Dwhoneil/ brings up using this in a peach rings flavor, with the aforementioned usage of INW Peach.

In a way that's a whole lot better than that sounds. Decently fluffy, bordering on a bit grainy. Solid sweetness for a handful of peanuts, but undersweet for a peanut butter.\n\nInhale is moderately dense and suprisingly salty. Roasted peanuts on the beginning of the exhale. Sweetness seems pretty well integrated in the peanuts, more like Valencia peanuts than spanish or ballpark peanuts. Texturally, has some serious volume but not particularly smooth. That salt note comes back through and lingers on the tail end of the exhale.  FWIW, the exhale leaves the room smelling exactly like roasted peanuts.\n\n**Off-flavors:** At 1.5%, a light malt-liquorish note to that sweetness,  sort of tastes like dark roasted peanut skins but just a bit fermented. The salty note can come off a bit cheesy. It tastes a good deal like iodized table salt. I've never really had the goiter thing going on, so I switched to kosher/sea salt a long time ago and tend to notice when using normal table salt. Probably just thinking too much about it, but I can swear I can taste some iodine.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Light. A little harsh on the exhale.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:** I don't think it's worth trying to turn this into a smooth sweetened peanut butter. You need some serious extra cream and sugar, and that weird malt liquor / peanut skin twinge and iodine burn is going to be fairly distracting.\n\nThe actual peanut taste here should work better for like a trail-mix or crackerjack kind of recipe.  The texture here will also give you a lot of nice volume to play with.\n\nI'd also consider this with nuttier, drier bakeries.

S&V concentration testing, it's fairly prominent as low as .5%. You definitely get more of a general peanut impression and it's a bit creamier at a lower percentage. The roastier notes are less pronounced but the mouthfeel is still pretty nice. If you're intent on making a peanut butter out of this, I'd start down here. In general, .5% seems to be the place to start with mixing this. Once you push towards 1% the saltiness really picks up.  You can avoid most of the off-flavors and weirdness by staying under 1.25%. I'd use that 1% as a primary peanut note.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nFair amount of Reddit love [here,](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/3lgp4u/yet_another_flv_is_awesome_thread/) [here,](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/3kqbcp/to_assist_the_flavorah_recipe_thread_heres_some/) and [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/3lu03p/octavarium8s_flavorah_flv_tasting_notes_pt_1/)  Common thread is unsweetened natural peanut butter.\n\n[Suspiciously good notes on ELR.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/45498)\n\n[Whole lot of five-star reviews on Flavorah's website, mostly in the context of a peanut butter either solo, or as an roasted peanut additive.](http://store.flavorah.com/concentrated-peanut-butter-flavor)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Peppermint, .25, 1, and 3% 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 5 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Fairly strong and clean candy peppermint flavor. Light sweetness, heavy cooling. Nothing green, herbal, or too realistic.\n\nSweetness level here is actually pretty nice. There's a little bit of body and sweetness to keep this from getting too thin, but it stops short of a straight candy cane flavor anywhere above .25% where the cooling picks up a bit.\n\nFairly aggressive cooling.  Builds on the inhale and kind of rides out through the exhale. Pretty smooth mentholation with no odd sharpness or off notes.\n\nMore of a peppermint candy flavor, no herbal or actual peppermint leaf taste to it.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Nah, Pretty standard peppermint flavor. It feels a bit less candied than some that I've tried, but it's definitely a candy base instead of an herbal mint.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Yeah, but that's kind of the point with anything mentholated.  Fairly heavy mentholation here, but it's fairly smooth as far as those things go.\n\n**Percentage testing:** At .25%, the candy part of the peppermint sticks out a bit more against the lighter cooling. Not too heavy, or syrupy, but definitely a sweeter peppermint hard candy type of flavor.  There's some warmth and mouthfeel to it that provides an interesting contrast to the still pretty noticeable cooling.\n\nAt 1%, this is significantly more icy. There's maybe a bit more candy flavor underneath, but the cooling definitely steps to the forefront of the vape. Sweetness helps offset that aggressive cooling a bit.  I don't find the cooling overwhelming at all at this level.\n\nAt 3%, this feels like mostly cooling. Sharp mentholation but nothing tastes weird or chemical. Candy note is a light accent at the end.\n\nAnything with cooling is largely personal preference.  I haven't found any hard line with this where it stops working as a flavor, and it will probably get icy enough for most peoples tastes without any issues.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**    If I had to take a wild guess, this seems about triple strength from CAP Peppermint, and maybe double from FA and TPA.  Sweetness is less sweet than CAP, but pretty similar to FA and TPA.\n\nProbably not sweet enough for solo for a straight peppermint candy vape.  I think this should have a subtle enough candy to use as just a cooling note in fruit mixes without that candy taking over.\n\nCooling doesn't have any weird issues, should work relatively well with creams, marshmallows, and chocolates. \n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

    "markdown": "**Setup:** Recoil w/ flavor barrel, Dual 15 wrap 26g 3mm Nifethal 70 coils @.17 ohms.  60w power, 450F temp limit. Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Persimmon @ %1 and 1 drop per 10ml (about .25%), 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 17 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** An interesting, tart, juicy, and sweet relatively authentic soft persimmon flavor with a solid throat hit. Throat hit is on par with something like FA Passion Fruit, with the same kind of acidic edge. Flavor itself is like a cross between a tart peach and sweet plum with an earthy, spicy peel note.\n\nInhale is tart and sharp, and on the lighter side of density. Bit of a sharp, acidic sensation on the tongue.  Solid, natural tasting stone fruit sweetness. Exhale has peach up front. Closer to a sharp, slightly floral peach like FA White Peach but with an added bit of realistic juiciness.  Deeper, more \"red\" plum sweetness underneath that. Slightly spicy, tart, top notes with a pleasant earthy edge. Sweetness tastes really natural to raw fruit. A bit light on density for the actual flavor, but the sweetness tastes pretty solid. Harsh, acidic throat hit.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Fairly close to a soft persimmon. I don't have a ton of experience with soft persimmons, and no experience with the harder candied or pickled varieties, so as always YMMV.  It's been a minute since I've had a raw persimmon, but it's actually really close with some of that acidity pushing towards the astringent edge to persimmons. Anything \"off\" here is fairly realistic.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Oh boy.  This might be a problem. I get a pretty solid throat hit on this and something that feels a lot like heart burn afterwards. I think people have a bit of varying sensitivity to throat hit, and I will say this doesn't taste any more acidic than TFA Pineapple or harsher than TFA Juicy Peach. So it may not be a dealbreaker for you.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  It almost has to be the primary note in a recipe. The fruit here is complex, sweet, and juicy enough that I'm not sure I want too many other fruit notes in there to muddy things up. Might pair well with a juicier, softer fruit like a melon flavor.  Seems like a really good fit for something like FA Watermelon/Red Summer or FLV Watermelon.  Seems a bit tart for adding in citruses, but maybe something softer like a tangerine may push that brightness further forward, without piling onto the throat hit.\n\nAcidity level is similar to FA Passion Fruit, so I'm guessing that mixing creams will work about the same way. I'd personally stick with lighter creams, with the added bonus of FLV Cream or FA Fresh Cream muting some of the acidity.  Seems to juicy for heavier bakeries and creams.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, this is pretty prominent at .25%. Bright, juicy, slightly floral peach base with a deeper plum body and a complex, slightly spicy and earthy top note. All of that acidic bright throat hit is still there though. Going up in percentage, that peach seems to get more solid and pushes a bit more toward canned peaches.  .5% brings together that peach and plum a bit, reading as a sweeter peach but still retaining a bit of an earthy edge.  1% loses some nuance, but picks up in sweetness.  Earthy notes and the acidity are making this taste a bit astringent. By 2%, the actual fruit here seems dull and muted, but the acidity is overbearing.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Heres the FLV Product Page. Their description: \"Persimmon is very difficult to eat, but oh so easy to vape. No stained shirt, and ready in any season! Our Persimmon is bright and brilliant as a standalone or mixed into a fruit salad or punch flavor.\"](http://store.flavorah.com/concentrated-persimmon-flavor)\n\n[One note on ELR, but it's pretty solid. User \"Daxbender\": \" This is an amazing flavor and easily standalone quality. I can best describe the flavor as peach like with mango and plum undertones as well as some light citrus notes in the background. It's not as \"brightly\" flavored as a fresh peach, but more like a cooked peach. Overall, very impressed by this.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Persimmon Spice @ 1% and 1 drop per 10 ml (about .25%), 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 14 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  A ginger heavy dry spice mix closer to cocktail bitters than a holiday spice.  Breaking down these kind of concentrates is hard (and I'm probably laughably wrong), but I'm mostly getting ginger from this, with some fruity/citrus tartness, maybe some cardamom, and a greener astringent note like rhubarb.  Really heavy and moderately harsh, dry body to this, like it's noticeably drying my mouth out as I vape this.  Strong, but i find myself go flavor-blind to the spices here fairly quickly. I'd use this as an accent, at .25% or under.\n\nInhale has sharp green, astringent notes and some ginger spice. Slightly sour but heavy base to this with a whole lot of dryness. Worth noting that this flavor seems really \"front-loaded\" for lack of a better term. The first drag or two seems to drive off most of the the spice notes from the juice and subsequent drags before redripping are more that flat, dry base.  Exhale has spicy ginger up front, with some green cardamom as the exhale goes on.  Astringent top notes, like a tart rhubarb or bitter orange.  The spice part of this has a bit of a boozy edge to it and some stinging harshness. The body has that same dense, dry mouthfeel from the inhale. This is noticeably drying out my mouth as well. Lingering bitterness from that astringent green top notes and that aforementioned dry mouth.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Not really an off flavor, but this concentrate has some weird mouthfeel issues. It's pretty intensely dry.  It also feels way too heavy for a spice mix.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Moderate. That spice mix is on the astringent and harsh side.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:** This is headed in the same direction as [INW Shisha Punch](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/5jr7zt/inw_shisha_punch/) but I feel like there are some serious stumbles in execution. I think the potential use would be the same, namely cocktail bitters and more Mediterranean / Persian / or maybe even Scandinavian style bakeries, but the mouthfeel issues and pervasive dryness would probably stop me from choosing to use this over Shisha Punch.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing this was rough.  Assuming I was maybe testing this too high, I made a quick dilution and tried this at .1%, and the spice note was pretty linear with the higher percentages.  Spice is present, but it was still a bit dry and astringent.  .25% has a clearer spice flavor, with a thick dry body.  A bit of bitterness here, but it's still pretty pleasant. At .5% the spice note is getting chemical on top of that bitterness and the dryness is just a bit too much for me. 1% isn't a lot of fun, spice note hasn't changed much from .5% but it's drying my mouth out a distracting amount. Testing the \"frankenstein\" hypothesis and trying this at 3% I just get overwhelming dryness. Like a mouthful of  bitter sand.  The spice note seems to be really muted here.  I'd keep this low at use it under .25%.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nLol, no.\n\n[Here's the Flavorah product page. Their description: \"Persimmon Spice is fruity and peppery note that is at home with gingers, apples, rubarbs, and other red heads.  It is unique, spicey and unlike any other when it stands alone.  You can use it to get a ginger note in root beer, or a bitters note with orange citrus and bourbon flavor if you are making an old fashioned ejuice.

It's a little too juicy and bright for pineapple bakeries, and I'd still lean on CAP Golden Pineapple for those.\n\n**Pairings:**  Damn near any fruit or cream.  Mints, maybe even tobacco blends.  I'd probably stay away from heavy chocolate or really \"cooked\" bakeries.\n\n**Notes:**  I think this is my new favorite single pineapple concentrate.

INW Pineapple is good, and is just a touch brighter than FLV Pineapple but has some light perfumey notes I don't find in FLV.  It's also strangely weak for INW and so if you are using 5-6% of the INW, FLV @ 2-3% becomes competitive on cost. \n\n[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)",

All done on a Falcon King bamboo fiber 75w yada yada \n\nThis is a review btw.\n\nSo I got this baby by accident (which was very swiftly corrected by the super helpful staff over at Chefs Flavours, love those people even if the FB group is perma flooded with odd stuff but hey that's what FB groups are for) and I decided I might as well try it. Risky seeing as there were no reviews and I couldn't put the smell to any specific fruit.\n\nI mean this is basically TPA Dragonfruit on steroids but seeing as neither Dragonfruit nor steroids have much of a smell might as well jump straight into the flavour details.\n\n0.5% is nice and tart as a shake and vape. However, in just 3 hours it quickly dissolved into just a fairly nice creamy/jammy base. Nothing fascinating after it did that.\n\n1% Same but a bit sharper.\n\n2% Same but went super muddied super quick, borderline unpleasant. \n\nNow on it's own it's nada fascinating but I compared it to TPA's Dragonfruit with Guanabana and then separately with FLV's Peppermint (and then altogether made a really nice recipe I ADV which I'll post at the bottom of this) and damn does this baby shit all over TPA Dragonfruit. \n\nTPA Dragonfruit just sort of sloppily blends flavours, dulling this, killing off that, it doesn't contribute at all I feel to the mix. This baby not only shapes up the mixture to be a perfect little not too sharp not too dull mix but also has a very nice flavour of its own. Of course, that makes it so that it's use might be a bit more limited than TPA Dragonfruit, but then again I only had the mixes with 1% Pink Fruit, maybe at 0.5% it works just as well (2% is too high in a mix, it makes shit too muddied and made me gag a bit). \n\nI honestly don't know what to say to describe the flavour. I can't claim that it tastes like pink fruit because female genitalia doesn't really go for that sort of taste profile (sorry for the joke). \n\nIt mixes greatly so far with mints, menthols, cooling, no cooling, guanabana, banana (I imagine, I don't vape banana), Fanta Exotic at 2 drops per glass (diet one, I hate the super sugary ones) and basically anything I've put it in. Even anise and blackcurrant. \n\nIf dragonfruit's an emulsifier with a nice smell, this is a better emulsifier with a nice smell and a nice taste. \n\n11/10 recommend it.\n\nP.S: Here my [new adv recipe with it](https://e-liquid-recipes.com/recipe/3383685/The Chain)\n\nP.P.S: A [further note](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/ej6r3j/flv_pink_fruit_or_the_better_tpa_dragonfruit/fcy0602) in the thread about this flavour.

    "markdown": "**Setup:** Recoil w/ flavor barrel, Dual 15 wrap 26g 3mm Nifethal 70 coils @.15 ohms.  60w power, 450F temp limit. Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Pink Guava @ .5 and 2%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 6 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  This flavor is one of those rorshach test flavors, it's pretty easy to pick whatever you want out of this. Tasting this solo, it falls somewhere between cascadia and citra hops, but without a lot of the pine-y notes you'd expect.  With more wattage and heat I start to pick up some distinct tropical fruit sweetness, somewhere between the top notes from a pineapple or dragonfruit and a guava sweetness. I've spent a lot of time describing this as a grapefruit flavor, but coming back to it I'm thinking it's more nuanced than that.  There's definitely some grapefruit to this, and it complements grapefruit flavors extremely well.  It has that a sort of funky, realistic grapefruit ripeness that you get off really ripe guava.  There's an interesting musky bitterness that tends to enhance that flavor in grapefruit. It's actually not too dissimilar to something like TPA Guava, just a whole lot better balanced and doesn't make the room smell like cat piss.   I'd recommend using this an accent note with raspberries, citrus, and tropical fruits at 1% and under.  If you want to really play up the grapefruit, I'd pair it with another grapefruit at closer to 2%.\n\nInahle is slightly bitter, with a pineapple by way of white grape sweetness. Tart grapefruit peel in the top notes along with that sort ill-defined tropical musk.  Moderately dense, getting quite a bit thicker as you crank the heat up.  Exhale opens up with a strong grapefruit hoppiness, with some higher bitter but not quite pine-y hop top notes. Tropical fruit really comes through on the back half of the exhale. Deep sweetness bordering on syrupy.  Fairly harsh overall, with some lingering hoppy bitterness.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  This doesn't taste like guava nectar.  While I'm a huge fan of that weird hoppy bitterness and musk, it's nowhere close to CAP Sweet Guava.\n \n**Throat Hit:** Fairly harsh. It's not like FLV Persimmon or TPA Juicy Peach harsh, but there's a definite bite to this even down low.  Some EM helps immensely, as do pairing with smoother flavors like INW Cactus or INW Dragonfruit, or bringing in concentrates with some maltol.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This is one of my favorite solo flavors at 3%, albiet with just a bit of EM (like .25%) to round out some of the harshness and just a bit of koolada to keep everything crisp.  If the whole non-piney hops thing appeals to you at all give it a shot solo.\n\nI'm admittedly a fan of this stuff, but I use this in a suprising number of places. At low percentages, this stuff is good pairing for tropcial fruits, including other guava flavors, pineapples, cherimoya, and mangos. I'm not nearly smart to actually understand what's going on, but whatever aroma volatiles they are using seem to share some characteristics with other tropcial fruits and seem to do a good job of reinforcing them and adding some mouth watering bitterness.  It also works really with lychees, adding some volume and sweetness to lychee flavors that end up being fairly floral.  It does tend to bitter up lychee up a bit, so you general need something else going on to tame that.  I keep on meaning to pick up the LA Guava to try Botboy's [\"Pink Panther,](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/3tqevh/taming_flv_pink_guava_pink_panther/) so I can't vouch for the overall recipe but that Lychee, Pink Guava, and Raspberry combo is awesome. \n\nIt also plays really well citrus in general, sweetening and filling out those citruses and turning zest heavy flavors into something more like a full citrus peel while making the inside taste a bit fleshier. I fully recommend exploiting the grapefruit-ish cascadia hop thing and the sweetness by pairing with FW Ruby Red Grapefruit.  It's the basis for a stupid realistic ruby red grapefruit. It tends to drag orange flavors into something more like a blood orange, and manages to sweeten up and contrast really well with limes, like in Manson's [\"Guava Lime Candy.\"](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/217#guava_lime_candy_by_notcharlesmanson)\n\nI haven't tried to fold this into a bakery recipe, but it doesn't seem like it'd be a particulary good fit. Using this with heavier creams with a buttery or eggy note gets really weird fast.  If you do want to bring in a \"cream\" component, it helps to stay away from realistic dairy flavors. I've had good success with vanillas like INW Shisha Vanilla, TPA Vanilla Swirl, and even DIYFS Holy Vanilla in small amounts.  It works pretty well coconuts, which can give you a creamy mouthfeel without any of those dairy notes.\n\nIf that hop thing gets you going, this also pairs really well FLV Yakima Hops for a fuller hops experience.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, this is noticeable but a thin down at .25% and .5%. It's got a very grapefruit peel note that leans more toward tart than bitter. At 1% the hops thing really starts to show. The bitterness comes out in the concentrate, and you get some mouth-watering effect from this.  Still more citrus than tropical fruit solo, but you also start to taste some of that deep sweetness. 2% is sweeter and fuller, and I'm definitely getting some pineapple / tropical sweetness start to come through. It's getting a bit harsh though. 3% is getting more tropical, especially with more heat.  The hops, and and the citrus is still there but it's definitely tasting sweeter and more candied.  4% is pushing it for me, the bitterness is starting to get more floral and overall it's unpleasantly harsh.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[A really good post on how to make FLV Pink Guava play nicely with other flavors. I take the point, it does tend to domineer a bit... I just don't mind it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/3rs47x/flv_pink_guava_grapefruit_overwhelming/)\n\n[Here's the ELR Page, pretty positive overall.  It shows up a couple times, so I'm not sure who to credit, but someone called it \"this isn’t a guava flavor. If you are looking for that tropical fruit flavor, you are going to be disappointed. That being said, FLV Pink Guava is an excellent citrus flavor, that sways more toward a mix between pink grapefruit, lychee (real lychee, not candied lychee flavoring), and tart white grapes than anything tropical.\"  User \"chewy\" adds: \"As has been noted this has a grapefruit taste to it, not quite a fresh sour grapefruit but not far off. There is another level to this which might be guava ? But regardless it is becoming a firm favourite with myself and it pairs well with cactus and strawberry.\"  I'm not even the first person with the hops thing, \"redruffensore\"'s notes are quoted as: \"Aggressive grapefruit/citrus and cascade hop terpi-ness. Terpenes dance just on the edge of fusel oil flavor. Low sweet fruity flavors balance high notes with guava and mango in the exhale. Pleasantly bitter finish\"](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/33048)\n\n[Here's the product page from Flavorah. Their take: \"A tropical delight, this pink guava flavor really transports us south with its sweet and fruity taste. It's like your own personal spider monkey climbed to the top of a tree and pulled it down, just for you.

I am getting a light and sweet pistachio note. This flavor steeps very nicely and reminds me of FW Hazelnut when used at a low % except with pistachio notes.\nAt 3% this flavor stands out as a spot on pistachio. Its lightly sweet and I can almost notice the taste of a real pistachio skin and the whole ‘nut’ itself. \nFun fact pistachios are part of the cashew family and are technically stone fruits. \n\n**Relatable Flavors**\nReminds me of the after taste of eating a pistachio, the fruit itself becomes creamy while you eat it and its creamy here while you vape it. TPA Pistachio is much more candy like but great in its own ways. \nI’ve used them together and the results have been pretty good but I need to mess around some more. \nHaven’t tried any other pistachio flavors aside from TPA.\n\n**Position In The Recipe**\nAt 3% I can see this being the main note of your pistachio (insert cream or dessert here) vape. If you want a sweeter pistachio I’d start with 2% FLV and 3.5% TPA pistachio then add your creams or cakes to tone that nut down a bit. I love this as an accent to creams and even bakery stuff at 1%, it adds a nice mouthfeel and the pistachio will not be noticeable in most mixes. This flavor needs a couple days to steep and at 3% it definitely benefits from a week or more of sitting. \n\n**Off Flavors**\nAt the higher % I could notice an almost butyric acid like note when shaked and vaped but it becomes feint after steeping.\n\n**Pairings**\nOther nuts, creams, ice cream, milks, pies, cakes, many desserts. I could see this working with tobacco, yogurts, some citrus fruits, strawberry, chocolate, coffee, pomegranate, apples, maybe even watermelon or apricot.\n\n**Notes**\nI really enjoy this flavor, I love pistachio things. FLV did an awesome job here, aside from Rich Cinnamon this is the only FLV concentrate I have so far and I look forward to trying some of their other stuff.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Popcorn, .25, 1, and 3%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 6 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Sort of top heavy popcorn with a bit of a buttery kettle corn-esque caramel glaze. Almost a light popcorn ball flavor.\n\nPopcorn here tastes like actual popcorn. Lighter flavor, dry texture. Nothing burnt or almost burnt in the flavor.\n\nThere is some sweetness, but it stops short of actual kettle corn.  Sweetness level is more on par with the microwave \"kettle corn\" style of popcorn or maybe corn pops cereal at the high end. Definitely has a bit of a buttery caramel note to it, but it doesn't really dominate that popcorn flavor, just kind of settles in around it.\n\nThe buttery note feels like it's more in the service of that light carmel than a discrete buttered popcorn application.  Not a really heavy movie theater butter taste, but is does a get a bit cheesy as you increase the percentage.  There's a bit of a butryic taste at the tail end of the inhale and exhale, but it's on the subtle side and I'd be surprised if it didn't steep out after another week. \n\nTexture overall is a interesting.  It's a pretty dry overall, but that almost seems like a fit for the profile.  It suffers a bit from Rice Krispies syndrome, where a strongly textured flavor without a stronger taste can get a bit cardboard-y.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Butryic edge to the butter note, still not steeped out all the way at around a week.  Dry texture, with a lighter flavor. Can push toward cardboard, at least solo.  Light caramel note, not a bad thing, but it pushes it closer to kettle corn than straight popcorn.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Definitely on the dry side, it gets weird on the throat.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At .25%, I'm getting a whole bunch of texture out of this.  It's pretty dry overall. Light popcorn top notes, a little bit of sweetness.  More like a mouthful of unseasoned, unbuttered but still lightly sweet popcorn at this percentage.\n\n1% is actually a little less dry, strangely enough. Not necessarily getting a stronger popcorn flavor here, but the sweetness is picking up some caramel and it does feel a bit fuller. Little bit of butter showing up too, very light butryic notes here. That dryness is picking up just a little bit of cardboard effect solo.  Still a relatively subtle flavor with a full mouthfeel.\n\nAt 3% that butryic edge is a bit clearer.  More butter, but it needs more steep time.  I actually feel like it's less dry here again. Caramel is picking up some chewiness like the softer caramel concentrates like Capella, or the caramel candies. Definitely sweeter as well, but I feel like it's getting a bit too agressive and pushing some of those still light popcorn notes out of the way and there is a light sour tinge to it.\n\nI'm still 100% sure what to do with this, I feel like you're going to get most of the texture out of this at an accent level around .5%. As a primary note, where you're working around this concentrate in a sweeter popcorn profile I'd probably push it up to around 1.5% to start.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:** This is not a really aggressive flavor, even at higher percentages.  It's got a lot of texture, but it doesn't feel all that saturated.  It's kind of dry, delicate flavor.  I'm not quite sure what to do with that in terms of mixes.\n\nYou may be able to add a bit more definition without taking away from the essential \"popcorn-ness\" of this by adding in some CAP Cereal 27 for that light corn flakes / corn pops note.  From there you could play around with some sweetener, caramel, or butterscotch to try to bump up the kettle corn.  A light touch with a heavily candied fruit flavor might be able to pull off one of those obnoxiously colored popcorn balls.\n\nCould be useful to dry out and crisp up lighter bakeries, with some biscuit or something in the mix.  Should work something like Cereal 27 in that role.\n\nMaybe some use to lighten, sweeten, and crisp up a tobacco flavor?  When in doubt, call it a tobacco additive.\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

    "markdown": "##**FLV Pralines**##\n\n*Summary*  \nThis flavoring is pretty dead on to [an American take on the Praline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Praline). I've never had a praline, but all of the things I would think to describe it (candied pecans, creamy, sweet, almost caramel-y), seem to describe the American Praline. It's got some nice body and sweetness to it. It doesn't seem to have any of the crunch or texture I would expect from a praline or pecan flavoring though, so it will benefit greatly from other nuts, cookies, AP. It's a pretty forward flavoring, so it's probably going to take the front seat in most mixes it's in; mixed low enough (<=0.5%), I could see it making a nice accent though. Overall I really enjoy this flavoring and it seems to be fairly easy to mix with.\n\n**On the Nose**  \nNutty, a dark sweetness but not sweet (if that makes sense)  \n\n**Recommended Usage**  \n*Stand alone*: 3%\n\n*In a mix*: 1-2.5%\n\n**Throat**  \nNone; mild.\n\n**Pairings**  \nNuts, cookies, caramel, butterscotch, coffee, tobacco, creams, custards\n\n**Avoid**  \nCitrus, melon\n\n**Steep**  \nPretty good straight away, but I'd say it needs 2 days to fully mature\n\n**Quick Recipe: Pecan Pie Filling**  \n*Ratio: 10PG/90VG*  \n*Recommended Steep: 3 days (pretty damn good straight away though)* \n\n* FLV Pralines @ 2.25%\n* FLV Macaroon @ 1.25%\n* FLV Vanilla Custard @ 1.5%\n* FLV Caramel @ 1% \n\nThis recipe definitely lifts the Pralines on high and lets them shine. Since it's light on texture, the Macaroon helps bring out some of the nuttiness from the Praline as well as serving as a bit of a crust aspect to the recipe. \n\nFLV Vanilla Custard & FLV Caramel act as the thick sweet base that the pecans rest on, but I chose these because they work so well with the Pralines. FLV Vanilla Custard accents the creaminess of the Pralines very well here, and isn't too dense or vanilla forward like CAP's offering. FLV Caramel offers a really great sweet accent to the mix. You don't want a creamy caramel like TFA Caramel Original, or it will get too creamy on you and take away from the texture of the pecans. You might be able to get away with subbing FA Caramel, but I really like the way FLV's Caramel plays with the rest of the ingredients.",

    "markdown": "*This a a pre-release flavor, which was provided to me solely for the purposes of review.*\n\n**Setup:** Recoil w/ flavor barrel, Dual 15 wrap 26g 3mm Nifethal 70 coils @.16 ohms.  60w power, 450F temp limit. Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Pucker, 1% solo, others noted, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 7 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Tart tobacco additive with it's own sweet tobacco note behind it.\n\nTasting the solo, it has a moderate and interesting tartness to it right up front.  I wouldn't say it crosses the line into sour, but it does have a bit of an almost tannic tartness that I associate with green apples or even something like an underripe bartlett pear.  The more I vape this, the less this reminds me of a citrus tartness, although I could see maybe something like a lemon juice bright tart note if somebody wanted to argue it.\n\nThe solo tobacco here probably isn't the point but it's definitely there. It's a bit smoky, with some sweet wet hay. The tobacco note reminds of overdoing some of my tests with [FA Ozone,](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/6swxli/fa_ozone/) as it has that prominent hay and the sweetness is very similar to the not quite a caramel but still kind of sticky thing going on there.  I wouldn't really call it ashy, but it does have a slightly dirty note that builds up a bit in the back of the throat.\n\nBut, that's probably all besides the point. I also put some testers down with some of the Flavorah tobaccos.  I figured I'd cover the spectrum with Arabian, Cavendish, Cured, and Burley.\n\nThat tartness carries over really clearly when mixed.  Comparing the solo and the mixed samples, the tartness is basically at the same level.  I'm not a tobacco expert by any means, but it feels like it's making the leafier parts of the tobacco feel a bit brighter but it isn't necessarily making them taste any more green or vegetal. Seems to be pushing the leathery and woody notes up a bit as well.\n\nMixed, I'm also picking up something that feels like a really light cooling through the entire vape.  It's subtle, and doesn't push this toward a menthol or anything.\n\nThis is adding quite a bit of sweetness when mixed. It's not really a caramel, but it has some of that softer feel.\n\nThe smoky part of this is masked fairly well by the Cavendish and the Arabian, but I can definitely taste most of that sweet hay of that tobacco note in the burley and and a bit of it in the Cured.  It doesn't seem to be playing extremely well with the nuttier or chocolate notes there.  FLV Red Burley seemed like the biggest stretch in terms of application, and this sample seems to bear that out.  Most of that tobacco note disappears behind the Arabian, and I mostly just pick up some additional sweetness in the Cavendish.\n\n**Off-flavors:** It's an additive, so I'm not sure what it's supposed to taste like, but nothing about the name pucker makes you think it's about tobacco.  So I guess watch for that.  Nothing that tastes chemical or unpleasant though.  Might be a bit overly sweet if that isn't what you're going for, and could push your tobaccos a bit cloying.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Solo, it's a bit harsh, but you've got tartness and tobacco with a bit of smoke so it's probably to be expected. Mixed with Arabian, Cured, and Cavendish, I didn't really notice a huge increase in throat hit.  It did add some throat hit to the Burley.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  I just mixed this based on some hunches trying it solo.\n\n.25% FLV Pucker, 2% FLV Arabian Tobacco: Arabian is pretty aggressive, adding some pucker just increased that up front while giving it a bit more body to kind of soften the vape up.  It's a pretty neat trick. .25% is probably enough for a tobacco that's already aggressive.\n\n.5% FLV Pucker, 2% FLV Red Burley: Nope.  Don't do this. The tartness clashes with the nuttier notes and makes the entire thing taste a bit like sour chocolate and wet grass.  The actual tartness here isn't overwhelming, but the added sweetness is pretty intense.\n\n.75% FLV Pucker, 2% FLV Cavendish: This shouldn't work as well as it does, but it helps to clean and brighten up that Cavendish. It tones down some of the funkier aromatic pipe tobacco notes and brightens up the leafier tobacco notes.  I am getting some additional sweetness that I'm not wild about here, but this is still pretty cool.\n\n1% FLV Pucker, 2% FLV Cured: 1% Pucker is seeming like a bit much here.  That tartness is good, the bump to the leather and woody notes is also cool.  The sweetness is overbearing though.\n\nBased on this, I'd probably keep this under 1%.  The tartness isn't really overwhelming at any of the percentages tested, but it does tend to sweeten up the tobaccos and that hay note from the underlying pucker tobacco gets too intense.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I'd keep this well away from desert tobaccos.  Makes sense, as those shouldn't be made much more tart. That tartness just didn't play well with the nuttier, milder burley and was pretty marginal with the cured.  That would probably extend to all of those RY4 and bready tobacco types.  They also probably don't have an aggressive enough tobacco note to stand up to the sweeter hay notes of the underlying pucker tobacco.\n\nThis actually worked fairly well with Cavendish, so this may have some use at moderate percentages with pipe tobaccos.  It seems to sweeten and define the pipe tobacco while mitigating some of the weirder floralish notes.\n\nIt worked well with Arabian to fill it out, so it may work well as a sweet and tart base to fill out almost astringent, earthy tobaccos.\n\nI think the intended use would have been something like cigarette tobaccos, trying to add some of the bite and tang of specific brands.  Seems like you'd have to start with a dryer tobacco base to avoid getting oversweet though.  The light bit of cooling here would work to bolster a menthol though, and some cooling would clean up a lot of sweetness if you wanted to do a newport or something similar.\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Notes of  savory rye, and wheat with a hint of sugar pumpkin at the end of the exhale.  It almost has the \"baked\" flavor from a fresh loaf of multi-grain bread. Its lacking any kind of spice, making this a pretty versatile flavor, as it could be used as plain bread.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  the rye flavor is pretty dominant. To me its enjoyable, but to some it might be kinda strange. personal i think this is pretty spot on to savory pumpkin bread. @ 4% it started becoming reminiscent of popcorn, as that toasted grain flavor gets more in your face. \n\n**Throat hit/ Mouth feel:** [2/19]  [3/10]\n\n**Uses:** an excellent base for any beady profile. Couldn't really see it as a top note, but possibly accent other bakeries or tobaccos\n\n**pairings:** Bakeries, creams, apples, spices, pumpkin, tobaccos. would avoid sharp fruits with lots of high notes.\n\n**notes:** this is the first savory bakery flavor I have found and liked.

This is my full disclosure that I haven't tried a lot of cherries, but so far my research is less than positive.  Welcome to land of off-flavors and cough syrup.  I've largely avoided them.  I picked up INW Cherries, and while I'm not in love, it's good enough for an admittedly artifical cherry note.  \n\nFlavorah gave me a ray of hope with a couple of their cherry flavors.  We are both from the great state of Washington.  We grow a whole lot of cherries.  The two major commercial varieties are going to be the darker red bing cherries and the yellow and mottled red rainier cherries.  Rainier cherries are by far the superior cherry for eating raw. Washingtononian as they are, I was hoping they understood the cherry and would produce something accordingly delicious.  Maybe a nice realistic sweet rainier cherry, which has more of a normal stone fruit vibe as compared to the cloying flavor of a bing cherry.\n\nThey did not.  Unless my taste buds are 100% off on this one, I'm having a hard time thinking of a good use for this.  If anyone else has a different impression of this flavor please share.  I don't want to be this negative about any flavor, but I'm not seeing a value through that plastic haze.",

I don't get anything fresh or juicy here but the sweetness is nice.\n\n*I seem to be in the minority on this, check the second opinions.*\n\nInhale is all top notes. Lightly sweet, almost bitter. Exhale is dense and seems unbalanced. I get top perfumey notes, and I get some deep berry sweetness, but this seems to missing the middle range that makes a fruit bright and juicy.  Finish has a slight lingering bitterness from all that perfume but otherwise fairly clean for a sticky candy flavor.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  At 3%, this pushes into an almost smarties ([american version, natch](http://www.candywarehouse.com/assets/item/regular/giant-smarties-candy-rolls-125692-im.jpg)) type of chalky candy flavor.  Almost a dry cotton candy feel.  It's a lot less pronounced at lower percentages, but you can feel it lurking right around the corner.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light below 2%, gets weird after that.  Perfume just lodges in the top of my throat with some tightness.\n\n**Uses:** Raspberry top notes with fruit blends.  Part of a full raspberry.  Sweet Raspberry candies.  With the dryness and the perfume thing going on I'd be hard-pressed to figure out much else.\n\n**Pairings:**  Bright, juicy berries. FA Raspberry or INW Raspberry are safe bets.  Maybe a jammy or syrupy dark berry. Blackcurrant to up the tartness a bit.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nS&V concentration tasting, just light perfume for me at .5%.  1% is a bit better, I start  getting an actual raspberry flavor and the sweetness level is dead on.  Still way too perfumey for a full raspberry.  This starts to get weird and muted above 1.5% and that perfume builds up in my throat.  I'd suggest mixing with this as a candy raspberry top note between 1 and 1.5%.\n\nIn context, I don't really see the point. TFA Sweet Raspberry is good for a candy raspberry. FA Raspberry is a good more realisitc take.

What is is here tastes fairly authentic, but missing juiciness and body.  There is some fleshy mouthfeel here, but it comes across dry and gritty due to that lack of a juicy base. \n\nThere's a light peel note here. Slightly spicy and grassy.  Not as prominent as the peel in FA Fuji, but still present. Adds towards realism substantially but gets just a little weird without a juicy base underneath.\n\nDefinitely tastes like a red delicious apple.  Flatter, warm sweetness without much in the way of tartness.  Sweet, but stops short of candy sweet.  There's almost a light hint of something like a banana, reminds me a lot of that same kind of banana-ish note from TPA Quice at lower percentages.  Not prominent enough to be distracting, and doesn't feel out of profile.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Solo, the texture is a bit dry.  Doesn't really have that juicy/mealy thing going on that red delicious apples have.  Also that lack of juice makes the peel note feel a bit too grassy.  Light chemical taste, but nothing too bad.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Moderate? Seems to need more a base to calm down those grassy peel notes.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At .5% this feels too light. A bit of red apple on the exhale, but overall just doesn't have any presence.\n\n1% is a bit more filled in. That peel note is coming in, but there's more sweet red apple base around it. Still feels just a bit thin and dry.\n\n1.5% is probably my sweet spot. Peel note isn't too prominent, solid red apple taste. Drier fleshy texture here.  Maybe just a tiny bit of a floral edge.\n\n2% feels a bit too dry. Peel note is feeling too heavily grassy because of that dryness. Some bitterness from the slightly floral top end.\n\n3% has an even stronger, spicy peel note. Apple base hasn't really kept up.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This really needs something juicy underneath to work as a full red apple. Seems like an almost perfect use case for CAP Fuji Apple, which is soft, juicy, and doesn't really have a discrete peel note to add.  I could also see this working INW Two Apples, but I say that about most apples.\n\nOutside of just trying to nail a red apple, this could be used to add some realism and sweetness to apple juice or cider flavors.\n\nI'm not sure this is right apple for bakeries without some serious help.  This doesn't have a heavier, cooked base and the lack of juiciness is going to weird with something like liquid amber. Might be a decent starting place if you want a cooked apple and wanted to avoid the crust note in an apple pie, or the cinnamon in FLV Apple Filling.\n\nThe lack of juiciness could work well to add some red apple notes to tobaccos.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  I can't find anything substantive.\n\n[Heres the flavorah product page.

It's a pretty solid red hots flavor, but I don't see a whole lot of applications outside of candy cinnamon profiles. Maybe a Fireball whiskey vape, but you're talking bright red and very sweet.\n\n**Notes:**  This is very concentrated. I made a really quick dilution, and even at .1% I get a clear cinnamon red hots flavor. Not super sweet this low, but still very present and identifiable. .2% is already pushing into full syrupy profile, and that spice is just ramping up. .4% is pushing it for me. Nothing off tasting really, but it's a bit unpleasantly spicy and sharp and only getting sweeter.  1% is overkill. Nothing that tastes bad, but it's just really intense. For science, I bumped the percentage up to 3%.  I wanted to test if this gets chemical or weird at higher percentages, and it doesn't.  It did blow the taste buds straight out my head though. It works this high, but you'd have to be some kind of lunatic to enjoy this.  Super linear flavor, this is all going to be personal preference. I find this is more than spicy enough for me at .25%, but it won't magically start tasting like garbage if you push it higher.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nNot really.\n[And here is the FLV product page. Their description: \"Red Cinnamon like a candy cinnamon bear or red hot. Can be a good seasonal cinnamon for spicing up a flavor, but it is strong and spicy.\"  One 5-star review on there from user \"Oldies Mike\" who reports: \"Preferred single flavor mix: 1% (2 drops per 10ml) At this amount, it is a total replica of \"Red Hots\" the candy.\"](http://store.flavorah.com/concentrated-red-cinnamon-flavor)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Not as good, but does the same sort of dark skin thing that Bilberry does with blueberries.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  It can get a bit medicinal.  Almost a robotussin vibe if vaped solo.\n\n**Throat Hit** 8/10.  Mysteriously harsh for a raspberry.  I'm getting the same kind of harshness from a tank, although less pronounced.\n\n**Uses:** Lower percentage to give a bright raspberry more depth. Higher percentage for the base of a jammy raspberry or mixed berry pie.\n\n**Pairings:** Complement to brighter berries like INW Raspberry, FA Raspberry, or even TFA Sweet Raspberry.  Liquid Amber to up \"cooked\" flavor.  Anything you'd mix up berries with, man.  Chocolates would work well with the dryer raspberry flavor.\n\n**Notes:** Definitely not a single flavor or even a great raspberry by itself.  I think it has moderate potential and I'll be working with like I use FA Bilbery.  FLV Boysenberry is the single greatest threat to this flavors relevance.  I can get sweet, dark, jammy notes from boysenberry with less weird drawbacks.  Maybe useful to avoid oversweetening a juice.",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Flavorah Red Tea, .25%, 1% and 3%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 10 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  This one was based on [Rooibos tea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rooibos), and it seems reasonably accurate.   \n\nIn general, Rooibos is a bit sweeter than a black tea without the astringency and with a nutty, almost malted kind of taste.  \n\nThis is an interesting flavor.  It tastes like a tea made of honey roasted peanuts.   Sweet and nutty up front, with a more traditional herbal or black tea backend.  Part of the selling point for Rooibos is that it doesn’t really have the astringency of black tea, but I’m still getting a bit of astringency.  The herbal parts on the back half of the exhale also seem to have a slightly earthy bitterness to them.  Kind of reminds me of the bitterness from FLV Yakima Hops but less intense overall.   Seems a bit bitter for Rooibos but I’m not a tea expert.\n\nRooibos tea can get a bit of a hibiscus thing, and this concentrate does seem to have something fruity here.  I’m going to say hibiscus because I’m thinking about hibiscus, but it’s pretty generically fruity.  The fruitiness gets a bit lost behind all that nuttiness, but the overall effect is interesting.\n\nSweet but not cloying overall.  Rooibos is a bit sweet on it’s own, but this feels sweeter than that.  Sweetness has a bit of a honey thing going on but it isn’t really heavy or sticky. Again, this vapes a whole lot like a tea.  Very warm and thin without tasting too astringent.  Pretty spooky accurate tea exhale.\n\n**Off-Flavors:**  Some generic tea astringency.  Bitter edge.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Moderate.  This one seems a bit throaty to me, at least solo.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At .25%, I get some of that nuttiness and some herbal bitterness but flavor overall seems a bit thin and dry.  Missing a lot of nuance, tastes like a light nutty black tea.\n\nAt 1%,  this gets less dry and noticeably sweeter.  Still pretty heavily nutty but that fruitiness is coming in.  Mouthfeel seems pretty tea accurate here, kind of warm and slightly wet.  Bitterness is working mostly as an accent to the Rooibos flavors.\n\nAt 3%,   this is getting pretty bitter.  That bitterness is kind of blowing out the nuttier pleasant notes from the tea and I’m losing most of the fruitiness.  Seems to be coming back around to dry again.\n\nJust based on these tests, I’d probably be using this from 1-2% as a primary flavor.  If you can figure out what the hell to pair a red tea accent with, should work well at .5% and below.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I’m honestly not at all sure what to do with this.  Makes a decent solo rooibos flavor.  I’d think about maybe adding some NF Malt to play up the sweetness here.  Would also work well with a non-offensive honey like FA.  Or hey, the nutty notes would work well with the cocoa notes from a dulce de leche flavor like FLV Milk and Honey.\n\nI was curious about how this would work with FLV Black Tea and just cross-dripping it, it tastes a whole like hibiscus tea.  So that could be fun.\n\nI’ve stolen this idea from multiple people, but they’ve been talking about pairing this with a tobacco due to the whole nutty and bitter thing.  Sounds like it should work.  I’d go for something pretty straight ahead like FLV Kentucky Blend or something.  I think you could experiment though.  This with Red Burley would be Nutty AF.  And this would be damned interesting with an aromatic pipe tobacco.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  [And there’s an ELR page up.  Here are some notes.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/234668)\n\nUser “Silhouette” writes: “A subtle earthy tea flavor that has unmistakable Sassafras notes. Also, some lightly fruity flavor qualities. A Roobios, or Red Tea is a slightly earthy, sweet, woodsy type tea similar in taste to a Black Tea. The first note I get from this is Sassafras, I don't know why, but it is there, sweet, pleasant and full of flavor. I would love to use this as a refresher flavor, with light fruits, FLV Ice, or creams to create a unique mix. On the tongue, there is almost a Bubblegum type sweetness, but that doesn't really come out when vaped. It's hard to describe. Still testing this between 0.5-1.5% Will edit notes on Single/Mix percentages.\n\nNote: I keep getting this estery, sweet note, almost like a Tutti-Frutti type flavor, like Isobutyl Acetate. It's quite unique. I like it a lot.  “\n\nUser “Jazzy_girl” writes: “The color in the bottle is reddish orange and smells robust with many aromas such as slightly nutty, sweet rich honey smoked. I tried this at 2% in a Siren 2, 24 ga single coil. \nThe flavor is tastes very complex with slightly nutty, honey smoked, woodsy grassy vanilla and hints of caramel. No off note at all. Very robust yet delicate flavors.”\n\nUser “Laura” writes: “Very dry and light flavor. There is a touch of cinnamon. It is not very sweet, no bitterness. It smells and tastes like a regular cup of tea with no additives (sugar, milk, ect) Wouldn’t recommend as a standalone, it needs a stronger backbone. “\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Red Velvet, .25, 1, and 3%, others noted, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 8 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  A lighter red velvet cake base. No frosting in here.\n\nThe cake base here tastes pretty solid. Fluffier mouthfeel. I'm missing some of the heavier, grainier texture that you get from something like cancer cake, but the texture that is here works pretty well.  I'm not picking up anything too rich or buttery, but it reminds me of a school birthday cupcake, at least in terms of texture and overall level of richness.  It's definitely a cake, but it isn't particularly rich or whatever passes for decadent in vape form.\n\nThe cocoa note actually feels pretty dead on to a red velvet cake, where it's definitely an ingredient but it isn't really a *chocolate* cake.  Lighter, fairly realistic baking cocoa kind of note here. Not nearly as chocolately as FLV Chocolate Deutsch, but what's here is a fit for the profile and works well without any kind of weirder off-notes or that heavy coconut in the Deutsch.  I haven't noticed any weirdness or coil gore from the chocolate parts of this.\n\nSweetness level is good. Not too cloying or heavy, but it definitely feels like a lighter cake type of sweetness.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Not really.  Pretty much tastes like a red-velvet cake.  Could stand a bit more texture, but definitely on profile.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Maybe a bit at lower percentages before it fills in a bit.  Nothing major either way.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At .25% I actually get a pretty solid red velvet taste out of this. Cocoa notes are maybe a little light, and I'm getting almost no texture to it.  Also seems a bit undersweet this low.  I do pick up some harshness and dryness here, with the cake grain to really fill it out.\n\nAt 1%, the actual cake flavor hasn't changed all that much, but the cocoa is a lot more defined and I am getting some more cake texture out of this. Still pretty soft and subtle.  That weird bit of harsh dryness has sort of worked itself out.\n\nAt 3%, still not an overwhelming flavor. Cake is maybe a touch richer, cocoa is stronger but not overpowering, and there is just a bit more texture to this.  I'd still call it fairly soft though.\n\nJust based on this testing, I think there are two ways to go about this in terms of percentage.  I think you could use this as your primary cake flavor at around 3-4%.  I think it'll end up on the softer side, but the flavor works well up relatively high.  I think you could also use this around 1% to add some of that red velvet style cocoa to a a denser cake base like FW Cancer Cake or whatever yellow cake substitute you've convinced yourself is an okay substitute.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Pretty good start to a red velvet style cake. Just needs some cream cheese frosting and maybe a bit more texture.  Maybe look at the vanilla cupcake flavors or yellow cakes if you're already  going to be adding some frosting.\n\nIt also reminds me a lot of a grocery store style chocolate cake, where that cocoa isn't really dominant and there isn't a whole lot of richness. Almost a chocolate sponge cake base.  I may be completely out of bounds, but seems like a pretty realistic option for something like your hostess grade snake cakes.  Doesn't have a heavy enough chocolate to really mess with a waxier chocolate coating.\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Rhubarb@ .1% or 1% of a 1:10 dilution, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 7 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Crazy strong raw, fresh rhubarb.  This is definitely a 1 drop per 30ml kind of flavor.  Tart, dry, and earthy all at the same time.\n\nInhale is dry and tannic. Really authentic rhubarb tartness with some sour notes.  No real sweetness here.  Exhale is really earthy rhubarb.  Strong grassy top notes.  Very vegetal and earthy overall. There is still some tartness in the exhale, but it's less pronounced on the exhale than on the inhale.  Same kind of dry tannic mouthfeel.  Again, not a hint of sweetness.\n\n**Off Flavors:**  Spooky realistic, so it may not be the sweeter rhubarb you're looking for. It's accurate to raw rhubarb.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light.  Not super noticeable down ultra-low where you'll be working.  The dryness here can get a get to be a bit much.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:** With fruit pairings, I'd suggest something sweet and jammy to fill out the earthier drier rhubarb.  Raspberry and rhubarb is great, also pairs really well with strawberry.\n\nA good base for a bakery rhubarb in something like a crumble or pie, but it will need quite a bit of fruit and sweetness to really make the rhubarb palatable.\n\nI like the idea of using this as a tobacco additive. It'll work quite a bit like FLV Lovage, although it'll bring in more green notes. Probably worth staying away from dryer, nuttier tobaccos and instead going for something more aromatic that can stand up to earthy, herbal flavors.  Should make everything feel drier and more tannic.\n\nSeems a bit too earthy to mix pleasantly with creams.\n\n**Notes:** Concentration testing, this one is easy. Start hella low. 1 drop per 30ml may be a bit too strong and you may need a dilution. The flavor here is super interesting but it's really intense.  By .5% it tastes a lot like dirty celery.  I think it's a useful concentrate, especially if you're looking for some authentic rhubarb complexity in a mix, but it's going to be really easy to go overboard with this.  15ml is a lifetime supply for you and four of your weird rhubarb loving friends.\n\nThe big comparison would INW Rhubarb. INW Rhubarb is great, but it tastes like a rhubarb simple syrup. It's sweet and tart, whereas this is tart, dry, and earthy.  I'd say INW Rhubarb is a candy rhubarb, and this is like cutting your rhubarb straight off the plant, shaving it thin, and popping it straight in your mouth.  I'd avoid it as a single flavor, but it's really interesting and done really well if you're into the profile.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nNot a lot.\n\n[Flavorah's description is: \"Vegetal, unsweetened rhubarb flavor. If you are looking for your mom's rhubarb crisp with 12 gallons of sugar, then you will need to mix this flavor with some other fruits and sweets, but standalone you will get a clear rhubarb with earthy and fibrous flavor notes.\" I think they nailed the description.](http://store.flavorah.com/concentrated-rhubarb-flavor)\n\n[ELR page has one note.

Use it like you would cinnamon in the culinary world.  \n\nIt is a tad steep at $12.50/15ml, but it is well worth it. Not only is it the best bakery cinnamon available, it is super concentrated; you won't be using this one any higher than 0.5%. I've found this to add the perfect accent to a bakery as low as 0.15%, and makes for a great flavorful cinnamon kick at 0.3%. What I find particularly awesome about this flavoring its range. Keep in mind though, if you want to bring it way up for a spicy, red-hot cinnamon, you may want a different cinnamon since this one gets pretty dry for me over 0.75%, but the dryness does calm down after some steep time.  \n\nIt is kind of hard to work with as is, so making a dilution of this one (10% FLV Rich Cinnamon:90% PG) may make it easier to handle.\n\n**On the Nose**  \nA deep, rich, spicy cinnamon; smells semi-sweet\n\n**Usage**  \n*Stand alone*: 0.5%. Not sure why you would vape this solo, but hell, you can!\n\n*In a mix*: <0.1-0.5% Depending if you're looking for a touch of spice, or a hearty baked cinnamon.\n\n**Throat**  \nMild, when used at recommended %s; gets dry at higher %s\n\n**Pairings**  \n*Bakeries*, Creams, apple, banana, pear, caramel, butterscotch, tobacco. \n\n**Avoid**  \nCitrus, melons, tropical profiles (you might be able to work it, but it will be difficult).\n\n**Steep**  \n3-4 days. Spices don't generally need a lot of time, but since this one is so concentrated, it's a good idea to let it homogenize.\n\n**Quick Recipe: Apple Filling**  \n*Ratio: 15PG/85VG*  \n*Steep: 3-4 Days*  \n\n* FA Fuji @ 2%  \n* FA Liquid Amber @ 1%  \n* FLV Rich Cinnamon @ 0.5%  \n* TFA Brown Sugar Extra @ 0.75%  \n\nNot my most proud recipe, but a fairly simple one that really lets the FLV Rich Cinnamon shine. You really get to push it to the limit here and let the main profile be that delicious bakery cinnamon, sitting on top of a baked apple with just a touch of brown sugar to sweeten it up.  \n\n##**Awesome Recipes**##\n\n**[Awesome Apple Pie](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/3gjxcs/awesome_apple_pie_recipe/)** by /u/Botboy141  \n**[Dutchie - A Delicious Stroopwafel](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/4e7snt/dutchie_a_delicious_stroopwafel/?ref=search_posts)** by /u/RuntDastardly  \n\nNot my recipes, but thank you to the creators for perfectly using this amazing ingredient. I feel like these two recipes play on the opposite ends of the spectrum of FLV Rich Cinnamon to show its versatility and at only a difference of 0.15%.  \n\n* At 0.3%, Botboy141's Apple Pie lets FLV Rich Cinnamon *sort of* be the star of the show. What you get is a great flakey crust, and an amazing apple pie filling that is perfectly balanced between apple and cinnamon, pushing the FLV Rich Cinnamon to its boundaries and really showing you what this flavor is all about.   \n\n* At 0.15%, RuntDastardly's Dutchie is using just a touch of the cinnamon to accent the mix. What this does here is really give some depth and flavor to the waffle, as well as accenting the maple/brown sugar/brulee cream mixture to bring this mix in to a different realm. You really don't even notice it the cinnamon, but it's what pushes an already great recipe in to perfection. ",

This tastes like a pretty standard root beer with Dad's or Barq's coming to mind first. the most impressive quality of this flavor is the foamy mouthfeel I'm getting. it isn't quite effervescent, but that thick foamy head is very much present.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Sangria, .25, 1, and 3% 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 4 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** This starts out with some boozy brandy, maybe some apple fruitiness, red wine, and sharper orange citrus but seems to steep out pretty quickly to more of a warm mulled wine flavor with a relatively heavy brandy edge, but no spice note.\n\nSort of bucking the trend with some of these newer Flavorah flavors, this actually feels a lot more like a heavier base flavor.  After it's steeped, I'm not getting much in the way of sharp, bright top notes. There's a rounder, fuller warmth to this does the mulled wine thing pretty well.  That citrus mellows and fades a bit, adding to that overall feeling of warmth.\n\nThe wine flavor here is a red wine.  Steeped, there really isn't a lot of definition. I don't think i'm picking up any really aggressive oak or tannins, so maybe something like a merlot?  The brandy covers up a good deal of the nuance of the wine, and lends the entire thing some warth and a bit of apple-ish fruitiness.  Booziness here is pretty restrained, with more of the flavor instead of an actual boozy hit.  The wine and brandy are pretty well balanced, and work together as a cohesive flavor.\n\nThat citrus starts a whole lot more aggressive orange note, but that steeps out pretty quickly. Goes from a distinct orange zest, to more of an orange sweetness and warmth.  The fruit part of this is actually pretty subtle overall. More like it was mulled with some fruit than fresh chunks of fruit.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Sangria is a pretty broad term, so it's hard to say anything doesn't really belong. The red wine, citrus, brandy, and fruit is all pretty normal.  This doesn't really taste like a cocktail version of sangria.  It's a bit too warm and doesn't have really bright flavors. The implementation here skews a bit closer to an unspiced mulled sangria, kind of like a gluhwein with some added brandy and no spice.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Nah, not really. A bit sharp from the citrus fresh off the shake but I'm not getting a throat hit steeped.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At .25%, I'm not picking up a strong flavor. The wine and the brandy here just ends up tasting a bit like a sweeter, cooked red grape.  Citrus or fruit doesn't really stand out, just sort of contributes to that sweet grape note.\n\nAt 1%, that grape is turning more towards wine. Brandy sweetness and very light alcohol bite is coming through. orange is pretty subtle, but distinct from the brandy.  Deeper base flavor, without any too sweet or aggressive.  Starting to feel a bit warm, but not overwhelming mulled.\n\nAt 3%, this feels a bit flatter and warmer. I'm missing some of that brandy nuance and the back end is kind of picking up a FA Blackcurrant warm, gummy edge.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I'd probably use this around at 2%, just based on these tests.  I don't know if it has an aggressive enough flavor to work as a primary note, and even at 2% should blend into the base of your mix.  You could definitely push this higher, maybe even the 4-5% range, but it's kind of flat at higher percentages and the warmth would drown out some of the nuance here.\n\nSeems like a really good base for a more complex mulled wine flavor. Adding some spice like ginger, cinnamon, or even cardamom would be pretty interesting.  It could also use just a bit more citrus. The grape note here could probably stand to be boosted just a bit as well with a darker, realistic grape flavor.\n\nFor a chilled sangria, you'd have to go a lot heavier with bright fruit flavors, and you're going to be fighting that warm note with additional cooling.\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Smoked Butterscotch, .25, 1, and 3% 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 6 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Pretty much what it sounds like.  Flavorah Butterscotch with a sweeter, non-ashy smoke flavor.  The smoke works as an accent to the fuller butterscotch, adding some warmth, throat hit, and making things more interesting.\n\nButterscotch here is really similar to the normal FLV Butterscotch, which is a good thing. Tasting them side by side, maybe the original tastes a bit softer and a bit tangier, but they are very similar flavors.  Here's the review for [FLV Butterscotch](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/4p8ntq/flv_butterscotch/), all that still that applies here, only not quite as vivid.  Buttery, softer sauce type butterscotch with a solid hit of butterscotch candy in there with some darker, drier caramel notes.\n\nThe smoked part of this has a sweeter wood smoke type flavor. Reminds me a whole lot of FA Black Fire. It blends pretty well with the butterscotch here, but seems to strip down a bit of the richness and buttery notes. Smoke is definitely noticeable but it doesn't really overwhelm the butterscotch base.  Nothing ashy or dirty, and the warmth plays well with  the butterscotch underneath.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  This, like straight FLV Butterscotch can get a bit cardboardy.  It's thick, and while I do get a good amount of richness there is a bit of bland volume in the base.  In his notes on FLV Butterscotch, CheebaSteeba suggests more cream, and that would probably work here too.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Moderate. That smoked note has a bit of a hit, but it's not terrible and kind of fitting to the profile. Some of the drier caramel notes from the butterscotch can also lean a little harsh.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At .25% I'm getting a pretty solid butterscotch candy top note. I'm not tasting much smoke here.  That thicker butterscotch sauce and the richness hasn't really shown up.\n\nAt 1%, this is tasting pretty full. That softer base is a lot more present. Richer, buttery notes along with drier butterscotch candy.  The smoke here is present but not aggressive. It kind of blends in between the harder, drier candy and the softer, buttery sauce.  A bit more throat hit, but adds another layer of warm flavor.\n\nAt 3%, the butterscotch here feels a bit too soft and sticky and I'm getting some of that cardboard taste.  The smoke note is a lot more present and tastes like too much Black Fire added to a butterscotch, as opposed to a cohesive flavor.  Between the sweeter smoke and the richness of the butterscotch it feels a bit cloying and odd.\n\nI'd say the percentage usage here would be largely similar to straight FLV Butterscotch.  Probably needs at least .75% as an accent, and I'd stop around 2% unless you're adding a bunch of cream or something else smooth.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I'd use this as a more interesting version of butterscotch.  The smoke note here isn't really going to clash with the cream, bakery, or tobacco applications where you'd usually be using butterscotch.\n\nStarbucks makes [smoked butterscotch nonsense coffee](https://www.starbucks.com/menu/drinks/espresso/smoked-butterscotch-latte) and that's really not a bad idea with this. Should blend well with coffee and cream flavors.  Looks like ChrisDvr already has a [smoked butterscotch cream recipe up](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/29299), I'd bet you could kick it up with some of this.  I'd also dig some smoked butterscotch ice cream.\n\nShould work well with drier bakeries that could use some warmth, like donuts.  I could also see this as an accent in something autumnal like an apple pie.\n\nThis should swap into most tobacco recipes that involve butterscotch but don't already have a sweeter wood smoke component.  It's a bit sweet, so you're probably more into desert tobaccos, but this would work well as the base for a RY4 and other tobaccos that someone who actually knows something about tobacco would be able to list.\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Smooth Vanilla, .25, 1, and 3%, others noted, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 10 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  An extremely potent, bright vanilla additive.\n\nWhereas FLV Vanilla Bean is a dark and spicy vanilla, this is very bright.  It has a light, fresh, fruitiness to it and a bit of a floral edge.  It reminds me of the vanilla from a marshmallow concentrate, or something like FA Vanilla Classic.  Just turned way up.  The fruitiness here can take on cherry or bitter almond notes at higher percentages, but it's definitely an accent to that big bright vanilla.\n\nFor a brighter vanilla, it actually has a good bit of nuance.  It isn't a soft-serve kind of monolithic vanilla flavor.  Those floral accents and the fruitiness definitely pull this away from a straight vanillin.\n\nI feel like there's some light body in here, I wouldn't call it a cream though.  Fresh03 was talking about spongecake when discussing this flavor, and that seems as apt a description as anything. I don't really think you're going to get to the point where the body is a factor.  This is strong.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Doesn't seem like a solo concentrate.  That vanilla way outpaces the body.  Gets too floral and picks up some cherry off-notes at higher percentages, but I think it's just crazy strong and I haven't noticed them in a workable range.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  As an additive, doesn't seem to add any real throat hit.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At .25% this is pretty intense. Very bright vanilla. Some lighter base in here, but it's pretty subtle underneath that bright, fruity vanilla.\n\nTesting this solo at 1% was probably a bad idea.  It's crossed over from an intense vanilla to something that tastes fairly harsh and chemical.  1% is clearly too strong. Base has come through a bit more, but that vanilla is just crazy strong.\n\nDon't test this at 3%.  I didn't know vanilla could be this strong, but here we are. [I felt like this, but with vanilla instead of sweet.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOmXu6PvEyI)\n\nThis may be the first vanilla I've ever tried that I would legitimately suggest making a dilution of.  It's intense.  .25% is probably a bit too strong.  I'd recommend starting around .1% and working up.\n\nUsing this at .15% with 1.5% INW Custard, it's just hammering that bright vanilla in. Doesn't seem to have much effect on the base there. A little fruity, just a bit floral.  Mostly just bright vanilla.  I'm not sure it meshes really well with the eggy notes, but it's working as an additive fairly well and just pushing a ton of bright vanilla.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Bright commercial vanilla booster.  I'd use this in low percentages on top of marshmallows, ice creams, frostings, bakeries, and cream bases. Doesn't have the spice or darkness of a vanilla bean, so I think you're more on the side of big, bright vanilla flavors.\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Smore @ 1% and 1 drop per 10 ml (about .25%), 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 10 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Toasted marshmallows and milk chocolate. I don't get a noticeable amount of graham out of this, but I can kind of taste it around the edges of the more dominant chocolate/marshmallow combo.  Fluffier, marshmallow mouthfeel.  The chocolate part of this and the toasted part of the marshmallow end up having an almost boozy note, like a chocolate liqueur, especially over 1%. Fairly strong for me, I'd stay at 1% and under, using this as a bridge flavor to build smore type deserts around, accentuating where you want stronger flavors or more definition.  FWIW, despite the chocolate note here, I'm not getting any real noticeable coil gunking or crunchy wicks.\n\nInhale has darker chocolate notes with a interesting kind of sharpness to them. Almost a boozy kind of bite.  Sweet, fluffy marshmallow base. Moderately dense overall.  Exhale opens up with a marshmallow flavor.  Pretty normal white marshmallow, with a building chocolate top note. Chocolate note really pushes forward in the middle of the exhale. I think I'm getting a kind of slightly bitter toasted note with that chocolate.  The combination of the chocolate and toasted still tastes vaguely boozy for me, a lot like a richer chocolate liquer. Marshmallow comes back on the tail end of the exhale.  Mouthfeel on the exhale is fairly thick and a bit fluffy bordering on gritty.  I maybe get just a bit of graham cracker, but it's more in the mouthfeel and not an explicit graham cracker flavor. Sweet, but not overwhelming.  Lingering dark chocolate note.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  The toasted flavor is a bit odd. Not as aggressive or warm as TPA Toasted Marshmallow, but seems like the same kind of thing.  Mixed with the chocolate here, it's a bit boozy. Doesn't quite go full bore into chemical, but it has just a bit of astringency to it.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Not really.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This is a good base for a smore flavor.  I think this does a pretty good job on the marshmallow and chocolate part of a smore, but it doesn't have much in the way of graham flavor to it. Texture is pretty close out of the gate, but It definitely needs an extra shot of your favorite graham cracker.\n\nThe chocolate note here is pretty interesting, and I could see some use in a cocktail application where you want a chocolate liqueur. I'm thinking backup for an Irish Cream or something like that. It also kind of tastes like the fudge ribbon in mid-grade ice cream, and the fluffy mouthfeel should work fine with an ice cream base if you're not after a super thick ice cream base. I could also see it as the fudge syrup on a banana split kind of recipe, or in a milkshake recipe.\n\n**Notes:**  S&V Concentration testing, at .25% I get more marshmallow than toasted or chocolate.  It's still there but it doesn't overwhelm the more mellow marshmallow. I think I can pick out a bit of graham cracker here as well. .5% is heavier on the chocolate for sure.  Still pretty well balanced, with a full mouthfeel but the flavor seems just a bit thin. 1% is pretty chocolate/toasted forward. Definitely getting some that boozy/chocolate liqueur flavor. 1.5% is getting even heavier on that chocolate.  It's getting to be a bit dark for a hershey's chocolate bar kind of smore.  2% is getting a bit astringent for me. That toasted note gets a bit weird, and the dark chocolate is pushing around the marshmallow. Some people have claimed this gets good again at 3% (*cough Kopel cough*) but it'll definitely need a pretty hefty steep, because I'm getting an unpleasant bitterness from that toasted and chocolate combo.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nNah, not really.\n\n[And here is the FLV product page. Their description: \"Yo Smalls! You want a S'more? Sweet mallow and graham. First you get the mallow, then you get the graham. Finishes with some chocolate, but if you want to boost the chocolate, add Chocolate Deutsch or FLV Milk Chocolate.\"](http://store.flavorah.com/concentrated-smore-flavor)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

It has a strawberryish sweetness that was almost imperceptible at 1%. 3% gave me the strawberry taste but also started to taste a little bit like strawberry shoes (as my  GF put it). I do not have trouble tasting strawberry, but this one had me scratching my head for the first few puffs. 3% definitely tastes like strawberry but is still much weaker than other strawberry concentrates that I have tried. It basically tastes like what I imagine eating a dry sugar covered strawberry that has been stored in a bag with some dryer sheets would taste like. It is worth noting that by the time I got to the middle of my tester the chemical taste had gone away and it was beginning to taste more like a ripe strawberry, but then it kinda kept coming back. the second opinions are all over the place on this concentrate, so buyer beware!\n\n**Off-flavors:** Plastic, or fabric softener, or shoe leather. The dryness is also not very evocative of fresh strawberry. this off-flavor was somewhat fleeting (it kinda comes and goes)\n\n**Throat Hit:** A bit dry, but otherwise smooth.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:** There is probably a pairing that would counter the off-flavors, but I don't think I will be trying too hard to find it. The only use for a dryish strawberry I can think of would be cereal profiles if you are bold enough to try and balance this into a recipe. if you are one of the lucky people who enjoy this flavor then the sky is the limit! I don't think I need to tell you where you can stick your strawberries!\n\n**Notes:** 1% seems too weak and 3% is getting a bit chemically, so maybe start at 1.5% and work up. I would like to thank /u/ConcreteRiver for sending me the FLV Strawberries to taste. I hope that the other ones are better!\n\n**Second Opinions:** [From the FLV page:](http://store.flavorah.com/concentrated-strawberry-flavor)\n\nOne of the best natural tasting strawberry concentrates I've tried. -Reviewed by: David Tedder\n\nThis flavor has been the only Flavorah flavor that I have not enjoyed so far. There is something about it that tastes like medicine. I made a few tester bottles with varying percentages from 2% to 5% and I get that medicine taste at all of those percentages. This flavor was recommended to me by a strawberry lover and I have to say that I prefer other strawberry flavors. I will continue to try to work with this flavor despite not liking it so far. -Reviewed by: Jonathan Goldsboro\n\nTried it in different variations - alone and mixed with other strawberries. Din't like this one. -Reviewed by: Evgeni Shmukler\n\nFrom /u/botboy141: Strawberry - 9/10 - Once again, this flavor really really works for me. Not great standalone but this will be replacing TFA Strawberry Ripe for me in most creamy mixes. This stuff is just dead on perfect, not candy like sweet, but just a perfect ripe strawberry. Once whiff of it and you'll understand. Don't recommend for standalone use however, could probably use 1/3rd or so of what you'd use of TFA Strawberry Ripe. A bit more jammy/jelly than other Strawberries I've tried.\n\n[From MonicaRae on ECF:](https://www.e-cigarette-forum.com/forum/threads/anybody-else-tried-flavorah-flavorings-why-not-do-it.665149/page-2) IMO YUCK. everyone else I've talked to has had no problems with it but to me at any % it tastes like either a rotten or dirty strawberry. Maybe I got a bad bottle? Idk but I will not be using the rest. \n\n[From ECX:](http://www.ecigexpress.com/diy-e-liquid/diy-e-liquid-flavors/flavorah/strawberry-by-flavorah.html) John says: \"A OK candy strawberry.\"\n\nMatt says: \"Strong flavor like other Flavorah flavors. Very good. I like this one. This is in between a ripe strawberry and a candy strawberry flavor. Careful with this one its a lot stronger than other strawberry flavorings.\"\n\n[On ELR](http://forum.e-liquid-recipes.com/t/flavorah-tasting-notes/17689) redruffensore says: \"Note: Tasted at 1% - 3%\nFlavor: Simple, jammy, juicy, macerated red berry with strawberry perfume. Relentlessly jammy. Powerful but not bright (few top notes). No off flavors or chemically notes but not quite strawberry fruit. Try with: Puzzle. Use to add depth and fat, jammy quality to berry mixes. PB&J!? Try against astringent/bitter flavors (tea? licorice?). Start at low %’s.

Sweet, but not candy-like. It’s not quite as good as TFA Ripe Strawberry, but a very close second.\"\n\n[More from ELR:](http://forum.e-liquid-recipes.com/t/strawberry-flavorah/126544) Laura5 says: \"bland, no artifical taste, good for undertones with other fruits\"\n\nAmy2 says: \"I find both SB and SB filling from FLV to be very artificial and extremely candish it works for me to only use them as mixers otherwise I get too much of whatever that note is that's in both of them.\"\n\n**ENOUGH!!!:** There were so many blurbs and snippets out there, but i thought that i would gather them all here since this flavor has thouroughly perplexed me. Ultimately, i think there are better strawberries out there than this, or at least less controversial ones.

This is not very much like a strawberry cream candy like the Flavorah blurb states; in fact, this would need a lot of help to get there. I think it would be easier to replicate that profile without this concentrate than to shape this concentrate into it. if you do want to try that approach I would use this very low as an accent. I get some of the same off-flavors that were present in the other FLV strawberries I reviewed (shoes/medicine), but not as potent. the long steep seems to have done nothing to diminish the off-flavors, which is unfortunate because this flavor is really good in every other aspect. judging by the mixed reviews on the other FLV strawberries I tried, I would venture to say that these off-flavors will not be tasted by everyone so YMMV.\n\n**Off-flavors:** strawberry shoes, cough syrup.\n\n**Throat Hit:** none.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:** this is a strawberry cream, so strawberries and cream is an obvious choice. this might work in a strawberry banana recipe or a strawberry milkshake/ice cream/etc. provided the off-flavors don't scare you away. 1% seems strong enough as a standalone but I would start even lower in a mix lest the dreaded shoe taste shows up for you.\n\n**Notes:** I've been very busy with finals and research papers lately so I haven't dropped a review in some time. this is the last of the FLV strawberry flavors that /u/concreteriver sent me for testing (thanks again) and I will be back to reviewing the LNW line soon!\n\n**Second Opinions:** I didn't find any so here's the FLV Description: Like the strawberry cream hard candy. This strawberry cream benefits from additions of both strawberry and cream if you are trying to pull it in a particular direction, but can stand alone if you have the candy strawberry note in mind.\n\n",

At 1% it is not overpowering, but rather mild. I'm not getting any floral or shoe-like off-flavors like I did from FLV Strawberry, but it is interesting to note that in a few of the second opinions these two were lumped together at least once for tasting off. The sweetness here is not too powerful (its actually the perfect level of sweetness IMO). Like daath says in the second opinions, this sticks in your mouth a bit (which I think is a plus for this one). \n\n**Off-flavors:** none that I got, but in the second opinions there are reports of medicinal off-flavors (possibly from using at a high %)\n\n**Throat Hit:** Not really.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:** This would be a great place to start for strawberry jam, or strawberry filled donuts. This will benefit from supporting strawberries in most cases. I would start at 0.5% in a mix just because this is by FLV. Average % of use on ATF is 1.25%; although, I could see this being used up to 1.5-2% if you aren't going to support it with other strawberries in a mix. This is already sweet so mix accordingly with profiles that need a sweet jammy strawberry.\n\n**Notes:** Thanks to /u/ConcreteRiver for sending me this flavor for the purpose of reviewing it with my God-like ability to taste strawberry flavors.\n\n**Second Opinions:** [From the FLV website:](http://store.flavorah.com/concentrated-strawberry-filling-flavor) JoeVapor says \"i ordered this and anxiously waited for it to arrive. The day it got here (along with 5 other flavors), I could almost taste it as I was mixing it as a standalone flavor at first to test it out. I must say, this has a very distinct flavor that is hard to get rid of. Yes, I instantly regretted this purchase on the first draw. It tastes exactly like that horrible children's liquid medicine. ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE!!! I am a big fan of other Flavorah flavors, but this is one that I will very adamantly speak out against.

It seems like FLV Strawberry filling without the sweet jammy quality, or like FLV strawberry without the shoe flavor. This does have a bit of floral and medicinal quality to it, but it isn't dominating my palette, but the strawberry flavor isn't very potent either. This seems like more trouble than it is worth for the most part, there are many strawberry flavors that will do exactly what this will do only better.\n\n**Off-flavors:** I do not get any strong off-flavors, perhaps just a hint of floral medicine that will probably come out over 1%. Interestingly, Jen Jarvis does a video review (link below) where she describes almost nothing but off-flavors.\n\n**Throat Hit:** This one has a bit of harshness compared to the other FLV strawberries, but nothing too bad.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:** This seems like a decent match for creams/custards, but I would keep this low (<1%) and support it with other strawberries. Not great solo, but not disgusting either IMO. ATF average % of use is 2%, but I wouldn't go that high. It seems like pushing the % to get more strawberry out of this will yield strange off-flavors, while keeping it low will require supporting strawberries.\n\n**Notes:** This concentrate was provided by /u/ConcreteRiver for me to test. It seems like overall, the FLV Strawberries are extremely subjective flavors, so if you decide to pick any of them up it would be wise to single flavor test them so that you can see how your taste buds like them.\n\n**Second Opinions:** [Flavorah product description:](http://store.flavorah.com/concentrated-strawberry-smash-flavor) Dynamic and full strawberry notes. Not overly candy in tone, but bright and brilliant enough for a candy flavor. Rich enough to pull down into a custard or cream base.\n\n [Jennifer Jarvis made a video review:](https://youtu.be/wcVsNWtYFiA) Her tests were done at 1.5-3%. I will sum up her opinion: do not use this flavor. I personally didn't get the off-flavors as bad in my test, but I'm no supertaster either. also worth noting that I used a slightly lower %.\n\n",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Sour Apple @ 1% and 1 drop per 10ml, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 7 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  This one is a bit intense.  Really aggressive sour, sharp inhale with a candy apple / green jolly rancher exhale.  Sour, sharp, and bright enough to work as a sour additive, especially in candies.  If I had to bet, I'm thinking this is going to be pretty solidly harsh for some people, so use sparingly and work up.\n\nInhale is sharp. The sour really hits right off the bat.  Definitely feels a bit acidic and intense.  Some sweetness and candy green apple in there, but the sourness is pretty overwhelming. Inhale is a bit airy, without a lot of density.  Exhale is a bit more mellow, but still on the sour side.  Harsher, slightly grassy, sour top notes. Moderately sweet green hard candy base.  Actually pretty spot-on to a jolly rancher.  I get a bit of a yogurt funk in the volume here, but it seems pretty subtle at 1%.  Lingering tingling mouthfeel and some sugar lips.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  A couple stray grassy top notes early in the exhale.  Nothing too weird for an apple flavor. The base volume also tastes just a little bit tangy.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  This one is a bit rough, and I'm not particularly throat-hit sensitive but it's getting to me a bit. The inhale is sharp and has a bit of an acidic mouthfeel.  Specifically a bit unpleasant on the lips. I get some moderate throat hit, but it seems like the kind of thing that will hit some people harder than most.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This definitely reads as sour. So it's pretty useful there. For a fuller sour apple flavor, mix with your fuller apple of choice like FA/JF Fuji or INW Two Apples. I'd personally avoid doubling down on green apples, just because this has all the brightness you are going to need.\n\nAt low percentages, this is more sour than apple, so it could be useful as an alternative to citric or malic acid.  A green apple candy base note is pretty easy to mix around, although I'd go for juicy or jammy fruits. Based on how much the apple seems to be fading in the steeped sample as compared to the S&V, this seems to be muting out the base flavor here as it ages but it doesn't seem as pronounced as malic acid specifically.  I think sour mixes tend to have a limited shelf life, so maybe try to get through your juice within a couple of weeks.\n  \n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, .25% is mostly sour.  But it's still pretty sour. A little bit of green apple sweetness, but mostly just the sour note. .5% is still really sour forward. A little definition and sweetness on the green apple, but subtle enough to miss if you aren't looking for it. 1% has a clearer candy apple flavor, but it's still sour focused.  Good sweeter candy apple flavor there, but it's taking a clear backseat to the sourness here.  1.5% has a deeper apple sweetness.  I'd still say it's sour focused, but you can definitely tell there is a jolly rancher in there. At 2%, the sweetness of the candy is getting a bit harsh and dry, along with that super bright sour note. I'd recommend mixing with this low as a sour additive. Starting as low as .25% and working up.  If you're going with apples, I'd bump that up to 1.5% and layer in your fuller, juicier apples.\n\nHow does this compare to FLV Granny Smith and FLV Green Apple? I'll have reviews up in the next couple days.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nNot much that i can find.\n\n[Heres the Flavorah product page.  Their description: \"Green candy apple with a zip of sour.

Would probably work really well as a mixed fruit smoothie, just like guanabana. Tropical juices.\n\n**Pairings:** Tropical flavors. Pineapple. Banana. Cherry. Apple. Creamy coconut. Just straight creams for something like a pina colada. Has a robust full fruity sweetness that should go well with candy concentrates like Taffy, Gummies, Jelly Candy, or Hard Candy.\n\n**Notes:**  This was hard. I don't have any experience with soursop as an actual food item. I picked it up because it was new from flavorah and I'm a fan of cherimoya from Inawera.  Google says that soursop and guanabana are different names for the same fruit, which is closely related to cherimoya. INW Cherimoya gives me a pretty clear creamy and an overripe apple. This has some of the same character, but with a heavy coconut inflection on a duller apple note.  It's get harder to describe what else is happening here.  It tastes... tropical. But a realistic tropical instead of a scented candle tropical. Life can't all be mai tais and all inclusive resorts. This is a tiny bit sour, a little sweaty but still delicious.  I really like this, I'm just kind of at a loss for words.  I'm hoping anyone else with this flavor and some experience can weigh in.\n\nThe even harder part is to compare this to FLV Guanabana. After all, they are apparently different names for the same thing. Vaping Guanabana, it seems to have a less pronounced sour note. A lot of the same flavors seem to be in play. I get a muted pineapple and a much stronger banana than coconut.  It's a ripe, realistic, soft banana note though.  It's also feels a touch thicker. [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/53xeu2/batido_de_guanabana/) was the best source of information I could find on FLV Guanabana.",

    "markdown": "**Setup:** Recoil w/ flavor barrel, Dual 15 wrap 26g 3mm Nifethal 70 coils @.15 ohms.  60w power, 450F temp limit. Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Spearmint @ 1% and 1 drop per 10ml, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 5 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Middle of the road spearmint in a good way. No real leaf, more  a softer spearmint oil kind of taste. Base sweetness with light mentholation.  Straddles the line between candy, realistic, and icy fairly well.  Not crazy strong, useful at around 1% for an accent or up to 3% as a stronger primary or solo flavor.\n\nModerately dense inhale. Round, softer, spearmint flavor, with a bit of building mentholation.  Sweetness is present, but not overwhelming.  Tastes a lot like a spearmint gum.  Exhale has more of that spearmint.  Soft, and kind of creamy without any real herbaceous mint leaf taste. Top notes have some sharper mentholation, but not overwhelming at 1%. That slightly bitter mentholation lingers, but it isn't overpowering. Still pretty neutrally sweet.\n \n**Off-flavors:**  Not really. Definitely a softer take on spearmint and not really herbal, but nothing that shouldn't be there.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  I can't pick up anything beyond the slight cooling.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Competent as a solo flavor for people that just want spearmint. Pretty well balanced overall, should be able to just set this up at 3% and go.\n\nThe usual go to for spearmint are melons and cucumber.  This should work really well in that application, without any kind of sharper bite.\n\nGood for an accent in fruit mixes.  Pretty unobtrusive but will bring in some brighter freshness.\n\nAlso mellow enough for cream pairings within reason. Could add some realism to something like a mint chocolate chip ice cream.\n\nGood option for other more herbaceous flavors like basil or rhubarb. Also mellow enough to work with florals, especially vanillas.\n\nI'd say mojitos, but this is lacking a bit of an herbal taste for crushed mint leaves and I'd really like a good option for a white rum concentrate. Lime or other citrus is a good pairing here. A mint julep may be doable though, those always read a bit sweeter to me.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, not quite the bulldozer of a flavor I'd expect from a Flavorah Spearmint flavor.  Lighter at .25% and .5%, just a hint of spearmint over a softer, fairly neutral base.  Might have some use a a slight accent at .5%.  1% has a bit sharper spearmint flavor, but still fairly soft and realistic tasting. I am getting some lighter mentholation at 1%, both as the inhale builds and at the tail end of the exhale.  1.5% seems to just up the mentholation. Still no off flavors, but a clearer cooling effect. 2% is getting a bit icy, as that cooling becomes the dominant characteristic.  No real increase in spearmint flavor, just more menthol. 3% is about my workable limit for this. Good balance of flavor, sweetness, and cooling.  Will be my go-to for a single spearmint flavor.  4% is a bit too cool for me, and I'm starting to get some slightly bitter off flavors.  Usage percentage on this is going to be heavily influenced by your menthol tolerance.  If you want spearmint flavor, I'd recommend starting at .5% for a lighter touch and 1% for a fairly full spearmint. If you're after the cooling, Just go nuts until it's too mentholated for you.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[The deleted user strikes again:](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/30si64/my_flv_tasting_notes_spearmint/)\n\n\"Round, focused spearmint with some Koolada-esque chill. Nothing angular or searing. Powerful but not aggressively minty. Sweet (not cloying). Well-behaved mint.  Fine solo as a pleasant ADV. Use anywhere you want full-bodied spearmint. Careful adding Koolada/Ice.  Old-school Wrigley’s Spearmint Gum (white pack)\"\n\n[One comprehensive set of notes on ELR by user \"Pro_Vapes\":](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/33042)\n\n\"Flavorah Spearmint is very true to its name. Unlike some other spearmint flavors, it actually tastes like spearmint, and not a mix of wintergreen or peppermint flavors alongside spearmint. This is a very straight-forward flavor, so there isn’t too much to say about it. It’s mildly sweet by itself, so it won’t need any additional sweeteners in a single flavor mix. This is a very smooth flavor, and is really quite unique in this way. The other mint flavorings I’ve come across both in DIY and cooking are almost universally a little too harsh on the throat/palette. So, if you want a really smooth mint-chocolate ice cream or grasshopper pie recipe, this is an automatic inclusion in my opinion.\")\n\n[Heres the Flavorah product page.  Their description: \"This spearmint has a cool menthol vibe. Not as strong and in your face as a spearmint chewing gum, this one is designed to work with other fruit flavors.  Excellent with blueberry. Give it a try with some of your stale flavors and it will liven them up.\"](http://store.flavorah.com/concentrated-spearmint-flavor)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

My best guess is that this is almost a floral vanilla sweetener with some cherry notes.  Tastes a whole lot like a cherry blossom flavor.\n\nInhale is mostly sweet.  I get something that feels a bit like a light cherry blossom with a tiny bit of leafy green accent.  Dryer but still relatively soft mouthfeel.  It's fairly sweet.  At higher percentages it starts to pick up a swedish fish type of artificial red berry fruitiness.\n\nExhale has a something that almost tastes like a vanilla up front.  Almost tastes like just the floral and fruity part of FLV Smooth Vanilla. Light cherry accent at a lower percentage. Back end of the exhale has some greener notes, but it doesn't taste overwhelmingly floral or perfumey. Lighter mouthfeel with a bit of an astringency at the back end.  Still decidedly sweet, almost to the point of cloying solo.\n\nI had initially thought I had mixed up my testers of their Cherry Blossom and Sugar Orchid, because if you told me this was a cherry blossom I'd totally believe you.  FWIW, this definitely came out of the sugar orchid bottle.  I'll review the Cherry Blossom tomorrow, so maybe this will all make sense.  Just doing some preliminary comparison with TPA Cherry Blossom both the FLV Sugar Orchid and FLV Cherry Blosson seem to share some similarities.  So I'm just fairly stumped.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Not 100% sure what should and shouldn't be here, but this could conceivably be from an orchid with that vanilla, and it's sweet.  I do pick up some cherry weirdness at higher percentages.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Light, really nothing major.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At .25% this is is fairly light.  Mostly feels like a lightly fruity, lightly floral sweetener.\n\nAt 1% that light fruitiness is going fairly red.  Cherryish flavor is coming through on top of that dryer floral vanilla. There's a bit of green around the edges, but it's not overwhelmingly floral or perfume.\n\nAt 3% I'm getting some harsher, plasticy cherry off notes. Body is a bit thicker, and dry.  This really feels like a cherry blossom flavor up this high.\n\nJust based on these tests, I'd keep this one low, probably sub .5% unless you really want a heavy dose of sweetness and an artificial character to the red fruit in here.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  That's a lot of review to say that I'm still not 100% on how this works and what to do with it.\n\nAs it is, I'm guessing this could be used a lot like a cherry blossom flavor in mixes.  I'd pair with other fruits like plum, cherry, or melon.  I could see it working as an interesting accent with lighter creams or candies.  \n\nThis would also be an interesting way to work in a floral vanilla and cherry note into aromatic tobacco mixes.\n\nMy primary use would probably be a light, delicate floral sweetener.  I could see it pairing fairly well something greener like FA Jasmine, or in green tea.  Maybe gin, if you're feeling bold.\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Sun Cookie, .25, 1, and 3%, others noted, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 9 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  A pretty solid, slightly nutty cookie base with prominent lemon.\n\nThe actual cookie here is pretty solid.  It's a medium cooked kind of cookie, not blonde like CAP Sugar Cookie and not really dark and crispy like FA Cookie.  It tastes like theirs something going on beyond just a normal cookie taste though.  It has just a bit of nuttiness and a slight green earthiness to it.  It's almost like a cookie base with sunflower seeds or some other kind of greener nut baked in, which doesn't sound promising but it works strangely well.\n\nThis actually has a bit more texture to it then most of the flavorah bakeries.  I wouldn't call it gritty by any means, but it sidesteps the fluffier thing that most of their bakeries have. I think this probably has enough texture that it doesn't really need any additional AP, but additional nuts would work well with the cookie and the extra texture probably wouldn't hurt.\n\nThere's quite a bit of lemon in here.  I don't think it's like an overwhelming lemon sicily type of sweet lemon flavor, but it's more of a tart bright lemon, almost like a realistic lemon curd without some of the body.  There's a lot of tartness to this concentrate, and I do pick up a bit of zest in there somewhere.  I wouldn't say it's FA bakery levels of weird lemon-anise, but I kind of feel some anise creeping in on the back end of this with prolonged vaping.\n\nSweetness level is actually pretty nice. It's cookie sweet, but not too sugary or cloying.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  The profile here is an [Isolani style cookie.](https://fivepawns.com/fivepawns_vape/isolani.html)  As far as I can tell, that means it's a similar profile to the juice produced by five pawns. I haven't had the actual juice to compare, but based on their given profile of \"Glazed lemon zest sugar cookie,\" this is pretty close to the profile.   There's a bit of green, earthy note here, especially at higher percentages.  The lemon is a little intense, and that small peek of anise is a bit spooky.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Light, but that tartness gets a bit aggressive with prolonged vaping.\n\n**Percentage testing:** At .25% this feels a bit undeveloped and I'm not getting much texture.  That lemon is definitely there, and you get most of the cookie taste but none of the texture.\n\nAt 1%, there's a pretty solid cookie underneath some lemon tartness.  I get some of that baked nuance from the normal cookie thing, and the nuttiness is working as a good compliment. Those earthy notes are really subtle and kind of blends into the nutty notes.  Pretty decent texture too.\n\nAt 3%, I feel like I'm getting too much lemon out of this.  It isn't bad, but it's blowing out the cookie underneath and just leaving some nuttier, greener accents.\n\nBased on these tests, this seems a bit complex to try to use an accent flavor. I'd probably use it as a primary flavor between 1.5 and 2%.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**    I'm going back and forth on the amount of lemon here, because it seems to be getting a bit more prominent while I've been doing this review.  It's lemony to the point where I don't think you can really mix around it.\n\nUsing that lemon note, I think this could be a decent base for something like a lemon bar or lemon meringue pie.  The cookie note here is going to work as a base for your crust, and I don't think the nutty or greener flavors are really going to stick out if you come back in with another bakery to fill it out.\n\nI could also see this working as a lemon frosted cooking if you mixed it with some frosting.  Some additional FA Cookie would give you a crispier cookie base, and some CAP Sugar Cookie would work as a softer cookie.\n\nIt's also pretty solid as a single flavor.  It's interesting and fairly well balanced by itself.\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**\n\n**META:** And that's it.

    "markdown": "##**FLV Thai Chai**##\n\n*Summary*  \nSo, when I first tasted this flavoring @ 3% I thought, \"WTF is this?\" Then I gave it another go at 1% and thought, \"...Seriously WTF is this?\" It wasn't until some time later after having a Thai Tea I realized just WTF this flavor is: it's an awesome representation of the sort of spicey/florally notes you would get from a Thai Tea.  \n\nThis flavoring is tough to describe; I think one comment I saw on it when vaped outside of its optimum range that summed it up pretty well was \"Baby Powder.\" If I had to try to describe it, I would say like a touch of clove, cinnamon, some floral note (I'm not very keen on floral notes), maybe some 5 spice or something... IDK I'm not a doctor.  \n\nThis is a pretty niche flavoring, and IME has not been an easy one to work with, but it does fill its role rather well and can help create a very pleasant profile. It's not creamy, not earthy, not sweet, so on it's own it's not super pleasant and needs help from other ingredients to really let it shine. It is rather forward, so will most likely be a main note and will dominate more delicate flavors.  \n\n**On the Nose**  \nSpicy floral note, reminiscent of baby powder to an unsuspecting nose.\n\n**Recommended Usage**  \n*Stand alone*: 1%\n\n*In a mix*: 0.25-0.75%   \n\n**Throat**  \nMild\n\n**Pairings**  \nCreams, florals, spices, honey, \"earthy\" flavors, taro, sweetness  \n\n**Avoid**  \nNot sure, I would think bright fruits and melons.  \n\n**Steep**  \n2 days. Did not notice significant flavor fade or change in 1-2 weeks.\n\n**Quick Recipe: [Thai Tea](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/7475)**   \n*Ratio: 15PG/85VG*  \n*Steep: 3+ days*  \n\n* FA Black Tea @ 2%  \n* FLV Thai Tea @ 0.5%  \n* FLV Cream @ 0.75%  \n* FLV Milk & Honey @ 1.25%  \n* NN 5% Stevia Solution in VG @ 2.5%\n\nStill a bit of a work in progress, but I think this is the type of recipe to really showcase this flavoring. Thai Chai benefits from the earthy notes brought by the Black Tea and Stevia, as well as some creaminess and sweetness to get it to really rest on your palate and mingle with your taste buds. Props to /u/StardustCoyote for his Bubble Tea post in the [July Recipe Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/4qrd3p/july_2016_recipe_thread/) which gave me a jumping off point for Black Tea; he's also got some really good ideas for bringing a sort of tapioca pearl to the mix.  \n\n*Please if your opinion differs, or you have another review for this post it in the comments.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Tropical Punch @ 1% and 1 drop per 10ml, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 6 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Worth noting right off the bat that I'm getting something that seems a bit different than what others are getting, so check the second opinions here.\n\nFor me at least, this tastes like Watermelon bubblicious gum down to weirder green rind note, with some added slightly warm red Hawaiian punch in the top notes. Seems like a pretty clear candyish profile, but overall is lacking a bit of deep sweetness and mouthfeel to really pull it off. Seems most useful between 1 and 3%.\n\nInhale is sweet and a bit dry. I'm getting some watermelon base flavor and some stickier, high punch type notes.  Moderately dense, but fairly top heavy. Exhale has candy watermelon up front, with some fragrant tropical top notes. It's hard picking anything out in particular, but I'm getting mostly guava with some pineapple as the exhales goes on. It's a \"warm\" vape, has that thing that woodier red berries have without a lot of the corresponding taste.  Maybe a bit of papaya earthiness in there too. Overall vape is sweet, but kind of a dryer, harsh sweetness.  Missing a lot of juicy or syrupy sweetness.  Seems a lot heavier on that candy watermelon base then on the tropical top notes.\n \n**Off-flavors:**  It's not objectionable, but this is more bubblicious watermelon gum for me at 1% and above.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Harsh under 1%, Actually a bit smoother between 1 and 3%, although it's still on the dry side.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  With some sweetener, and maybe a bit of added juiciness, it would make a pretty decent take on Hawaiian punch.  I think the relative dryness is kind of pushing that melon to the front, and with a bit of a moister, sweeter mouthfeel that tropical top end should pick up a bit.\n\nMelon and red berries should complement this pretty well, reinforcing some of the flavor already there.\n\nIf you cranked the sweetness up and added some candy texturizers, this would be a good base for some of the more tropical starburst or maybe skittles kind of candy flavors.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, .25% is light, floral, and harsh.  .5% is a bit better, but still on the lighter side of flavor.  Just the slightly dry, \"red\" part of this without a deeper base.  1% is a bit fuller, the red is a little less prominent, but I'm getting something that tastes a whole lot like warm watermelon bubblegum. Interesting, but a little weird.  1.5% is a little more mellow. That harsher \"red\" note seems to be sitting pretty well in the background while the candy watermelon pushes forward.  Fairly full flavor, but it feels like it's missing some depth and juiciness.  2% is closer to a slightly flat, undersweet watermelon bubble gum. The hawaiian punch part of this is pretty far in the background. Flavor seems pretty well saturated to me by 3%, with some of that weirder greener fake rind starting to come out of the concentrate. Still a bit undersweet, but moving up to 4 and 5% didn't seem to fix that while muddying and up the flavor substantially and adding quite a bit of dryness.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[All I do is follow the trail of someone who has stopped existing, the deleted user.. yet again:](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/32whni/my_flv_tasting_notes_tropical_punch/)\n\n\"Pleasant if somewhat generic tropical punch flavors with no one flavor dominant. Very “Red Hawaiian Punch”. Mild flavor. No off notes present. Try with rum, tropical/citrus fruits, rose and almond in a Mai-Tai mix.\"\n\n[Here's the ELR Page, consensus seems to be that it's fairly accurate to hawaiian punch, doesn't have any weird off flavors, and suggested between 3.5% and 5.0% for a single flavor.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/3302)\n\n\n[Heres the Flavorah product page.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Vanilla Bean, .25, 1, and 3%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 8 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** A spicier realistic vanilla bean flavor that works like straight vanillin.\n\nSolo, there's basically no body to this.  A majority of vanillas on the market have some sort of heavier base to them, usually some sort of cream.  This really doesn't.  It also doesn't have a thicker vanilla extract kind of base like FA or TPA Vanilla Bourbon.  Mechanically, it's functioning pretty much like vanillin.  It's just boosting existing vanilla flavors and giving a sort of ethereal vanilla top note to things.\n\nI've mixed this up with INW Custard, mostly because I like it and it doesn't seem to require much of a steep. I've used 1.5% solo INW Custard, and then samples with 1% TPA Vanillin and 1% FLV Vanilla bean.\n\nTesting the custard solo, it tastes like it should. Rich vanilla, heavier eggy note, and a bit of butter to it.  The vanillin brightens up the vanilla in there substantially but it feels a bit one-dimensional and artificial.\n\nThe FLV Vanilla Bean brought in a bit more nuance and the vanilla top note has a spicier, more complex vanilla to it.  Fairly robust tasting vanilla bean with a bit of earthiness to it as well.  It's a very accurate straight from the vanilla bean flavor.\n\nIf you ever used whole vanilla beans when actually cooking custards, the effect is really similar.\n\nBased on this (admittedly slapdash) testing, I'd venture to say this  really is going to work a lot more like a fancier, more nuanced version of straight vanillin.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  I mean, it's not a solo flavor, or even a solo vanilla component.  It's going to enhance and brighten your vanillas more than anything else.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Nah, but there isn't much body here to actually hit your throat.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  I'm not really sure solo testing is all the useful here because of the way this flavor is working.  I have my tests down at .25%, 1%, and 3% and none of them really feel like a full flavor.  I taste basically nothing at .25%, 1% does have some vanilla notes, but it's very aromatic and there's almost no base. 3% is picking up some bitterness and sourness and feels overblown.  I will say tasting the steeped version at 1% and a fresh mix at 1%, this doesn't seem to have much of a fade-out, which is a concern with more ethereal flavors.\n\nBased on the INW custard test, I'd probably be using this as that vanilla top note around .25-75%.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Again, there's a whole group of people doing this beta testing and sharing notes, so half of this is ripped off from other people's usage ideas.\n\nThis is going to work really well to enhance the vanilla in custards, creams, and ice creams.  It should work to make the vanilla that's already present in most of those kinds of concentrates a bit more lively, while adding depth and complexity to the mix.  Personally, I find using vanillin to do that always ends up tasting a bit like soft serve ice cream, while this is more complex and feels more realistic to actual vanilla bean. Wayne of DIYorDIE fame/infamy used it in a [live mixing recipe](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/62158#live_mixing_09_01_17_by_enyawreklaw) and if I had to guess it's sitting on top of the milkshake base there just reinforcing all that vanilla in the VBIC, Meringue, and Graham Cracker.\n\n[Thadentman also used it in a posted a root beer float recipe using this, FLV Root Beer, FW VBIC, and CAP whipped cream.](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/62295#root_beer_float_by_thadentman)  Again, it's going to be enhancing all of those vanillas.  I'd think this would have some use with root beer outside of just a float though.  The way that vanilla bean lands this would have serious potential with root beer, cola, ginger ale ([shoutout to Kopel](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/62195#ginger_beer_by_kopel)), and other soda flavors to lend that same kind of effervescent sparkling top note of vanilla you get from a soda.\n\nSince this doesn't have all that cream base baggage, this could be used with drier, crisper bakeries and tobaccos to get vanilla notes into something where you don't want to mess with the texture.\n\nI have no pricing information on this, but I'm thinking you may have to gird your wallets based on how nuts vanilla pricing in general is right now.\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Waffle @ 1% and 1 drop per 10ml, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 7 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  This one is... interesting. If anyone has insight here, for the love of god, share it with the rest of the class. Used super low, it almost tastes like a sweet whole grain bread, with some doughy notes.  Anything over .15% and I'm getting some serious earthy, almost astringent (like FLV Rhubarb) notes.  I'm having a lot of trouble seeing this as a waffle flavor.  I think this may have niche use in boosting aromatic tobaccos, but it's going to be a pretty small niche.\n\nInhale has a vegetal, slightly astringent sweetness. Decent body, but pretty odd.  Exhale has some doughy notes up front.  Could theoretically be a waffle batter, but I'm missing any of the crispier, sweeter texture of a waffle.  Top notes start off with an almost sour, slighty yeasty, tang and pick up a bitter vegetal astringency.  Like raw rhubarb actually. Moderately full with some sweetness here, but nothing that really reads as anything that should be near a waffle.  That vegetal note ends up lingering quite a bit, turning almost acrid like the top notes from an overcooked waffle. I'm a bit stumped.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  I can't really see this tasting much like a waffle, but maybe it's just going to take a better mixer than me to figure it out.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Used low, no real throat hit.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I may just be lacking in imagination or technical skill here, but this seems like no part of an actual waffle. There's some doughyness, but even down low there's a pretty serious vegetal quality to this.\n\nI can see this being used as a tobacco additive, but again pretty low. It would take a non-aromatic tobacco and add some bready and green leafy notes.\n\nThere may be some use here in making your bready desert base pick up some whole grain nuance or maybe a light griddled note, but I don't know if thats a thing that people are into.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, this is super concentrated and super finicky. After my initial tests, I went back and made a 10% dilution.  At .1% (less than 1 drop per 30ml), I get a sweet whole grain bread in the top notes. No really body down this low, but the top notes have a pretty aggresive presence. .15% is starting to taste like that grain has sprouted a bit, I'm getting some odd crisp green notes, especially towards the end of the exhale. .2% is pushing earthy pretty hard. That green note is a little astringent.  At .25% that green note is dominating the back of the exhale and colonizing the inhale.  Just for laughs, trying my sample at 1%, it's really astringent and funky.  The bread is pretty lost underneath that vegetal note.  I'd maybe use this at .1% to whole grain up a bread base, and maybe .2% for a tobacco additive.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[One review on BCF, user \"Brad\" gives it 4 stars and says: \"Not a stand alone imo. Kinda \"raw doughy\" taste and feel. Better when I added some berry flavors. No syrup flavor I could notice. Like a under cooked fresh waffle, batter kind of flavor. Still good for the collection.\"](http://www.bullcityflavors.com/waffle-flv/)  So I'm defintely not agreeing here.\n\n[One note on ELR, by user \"Brian_SFL\": \"nope. nothing like waffle to me. .\"  He still gave it two stars though, so?](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/122877)\n\n[Heres the Flavorah product page.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Watermelon@ %.5 and 1.5%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 19 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** A soft, lightly artificial watermelon flavor. Should work to add some sweetness and volume to a mix when used as an accent. The flesh part of the watermelon is a little artificial, with a slight perfumey edge that comes out at higher percentages. Realistic rind note, more of that white fragrant part of the rind as opposed to the actual skin of the melon.\n\nFairly dense inhale, with a sharper, floral watermelon flavor.  A little warm, with a moderate level of sweetness. Exhale is much softer than the inhale, with that candy watermelon flesh up front and more realistic white rind top notes. Still pretty dense, especially considering the lower percentage used.  Doesn't seem particularly juicy, but it gets a bit mouth-watering, which is cool. Sweetness tastes a little artificial, but not super overwhelming.  Gets floral above 1% though, with the exhale getting some of the same sharpness as the inhale.  Lingering rind note.\n\n**Off Flavors:** Used low, the flesh of the watermelon tastes a little artificial.  Probably not the worst thing, considering real watermelon is pretty subtle and easy to lose in a mix.  Used above 1%, the floral edge really starts to come out and that artificial watermelon flavor gets an artificial sweetener note.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Used at .5%, not really. Starts to pick up a throat hit at 1% and is pretty pronounced by 2%.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Good for some fairly realistic watermelon background noise at .5%.  Popping this in a fruit mix to add depth to brighter flavors in the forefront seems like the best bet. Comparable usage to FA Watermelon in that way.\n\nI don't think this is a good watermelon to try to push to the front of recipes as a primary note. Increasing percentage to try to push the flavor to the front gives you a clear perfumey edge.  Real watermelon is pretty subtle, and I think if you want it up front you'll want a brighter, cleaner watermelon candy flavor.\n\n**Notes:**  S&V concentration testing, this is way better down low. .25% seems a bit weak, but by .5% I get a really nice watermelon accent. A little bit candy, but nice, round, and sweet. It's not an aggressive flavor by any means, but it'll work really well as an accent that low.  At 1%, you get a bit of harshness and a slightly sharper candy flavor that kind of tastes like the rind of a watermelon. At 1.5% this is starting to get a bit bitter and sharp. 2% is sweet but a little rough, a candy watermelon flavor with a floral edge.  At 3% this is definitely a candy watermelon. The perfumey edge will steep down a bit, but you've still got a fair bit of harshness. Above 3%, this just seems like a bad candy watermelon. I'd suggest using this an accent flavor at .5%, maybe working up to 1% if you want some candy in there and can deal with a bit of a throat hit.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Some information on ELR. Seems to be leaning toward higher %'s with this because it's a softer flavor.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/33046)\n\n[Jbird has a watermelon bubble gum recipe on ATF using this with some Wild Melon and Canteloupe backup.  \"FLV Watermelon - This is a good candy watermelon. Although, you can taste a little bit of the white part (rind) which I wasn't expecting from a candied flavor. It lends a hand at making the recipe a bit more juicy too.\"](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/35898#honeymelon_bubble_gum_by_jbird)\n\n[/u/Eein/ describes FLV Watermelon in a watermelon thread: \"I really like FLV watermelon - it has a juicy organic rind smell (that i noticed doesn't transfer) and when mixed solo or with a couple drops of koolada tastes like a wet jolly rancher; not overpowering though.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Wheat, .25, 1, and 3%, others noted, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 9 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Somewhere between a cracked wheat top note and a wheat bread additive.\n\nAround 1%, definitely a wheat bread. Not full on 74 whole grains and no sweetness style of wheat bread, but more [the brown flavor of square bread.](https://cdn1.healthambition.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/28094304/imag2.jpg)\n\nRelatively subtle yeastiness here, much more accurate to cooked bread than something aggressive like FA Joy or FLV Fried Dough. This doesn't seem like the kind of bready concentrate that's going to go straight to stale beer if you use an extra quarter of a percent.  The concentrate in the bottle smells like proofing bread, but that warm yeastiness is fairly well balanced and doesn't overwhelm the concentrate when steeped.\n\nThere's a bit of fruity sweetness and some sourness in the base of this. Not enough to be truly offputting, but solo it's a bit distracting.  Not really all that noticeable at lower percentages, and shouldn't be a big issue in mixes.\n\nI'm missing some texture here, the top note accurate but it doesn't have the body to really carry it, at least solo.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Not really a solo flavor, the base is a bit thin and sweet without that bready texture.  Gets a little earthy and picks up a green malt note at higher percentage.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Nah, not really.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At .25%, i get a thin wheat top note out of this. Pretty much nothing going on in the base, but there's a light wheat coming through in the top notes.  Light sourness here, but not overwhelming.  I actually think it tastes like how cracked wheat smells at low percentages, and it seems to be picking up just a bit of grassiness.\n\nAt 1% this is a clearer wheat bread type of flavor. Light yeasty note here, and a warmer wheat flavor. Base is a bit sweeter, but not all that much thicker. Maybe a touch of a greener malt flavor, but works pretty well as an accent. Still missing some texture.\n\nAt 3% this is definitely more present, but hasn't gotten all that weird or aggressive. Yeast note is more pronounced, and maybe pushing more towards overwhelming.  Greener, earthy flavor starting to pick up a bit. Soft base, very light texture.\n\nJust based on these tests, I'd probably use this around .75-1.5% as a wheat top note in mixes.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I'd use this more as a wheat additive to existing bready bakery mixes. I don't think quite has the body to pull off a bread by itself, but it should be able to pull more neutral flavors into something a bit heartier.  I could see using this to bend cake and donut flavors to hit more specialized varities. Would make a decent stand-in in a donut flavor to something more traditional and less of a krispy kreme sugar bomb.  Good modifier for a bread base if it needs a bit more presence in a mix.\n\nShould pair well with cereals as well, would probably let you take everything in a healthy-ish tasting direction if you'd like more raisin bran than frosted flakes.\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

I almost get an Orange Watermelon flavor from it, similar to INW Melon but a little better IMO. If I had to try to pick which melons I'm tasting I would say Watermelon, Honeydew, Cantaloupe. I'm not sure what exactly they were going for with this one but it came out really darn tasty. \n\n**On the Nose**  \nGetting mostly a scent of a sweet, perfectly ripe honeydew. Detecting banana (realistic, medium-ripe)? wtf?\n\n**Usage**  \n*Stand alone*: 2-3% for a tasty, full flavored melon vape.  \n\n*In a mix*: .5-2% depending on how prominent you want the melon.  \n\n**Throat**  \nModerate  \n\n**Pairings**  \nCreams (light on dairy note), Marshmallow, other melons, fruits.  \n\n**Avoid**  \nCoffee, creams with heavy dairy notes. This is a pretty bright flavor so I'd imagine overly \"dark\" flavors would clash.  \n\n**Steep**  \nWith this being a pretty bright fruit, it doesn't necessarily need to steep long, I'd say overnight for this one. Seems to hold it's own pretty well throughout a steep of a few weeks; haven't had a mix on hand last longer than 1m to see how it fares. \n\n**Quick Recipe: Melon Mix**  \n*Ratio: 10PG/90VG*  \n*Steep: 3+ days*  \n\n* FLV Wild Melon @ 1.5%  \n* FLV Cantaloupe @ 0.75%  \n* TFA Marshmallow @ 1%  \n* FLV Cream @ 1%  \n\nThis is just a quick recipe I vape to give an idea of how I like to use it. This mix IMO really lets the Wild Melon shine. *FLV Cantaloupe* is a great cantaloupe flavor that's almost creamy, which boosts the melon as well as accenting the creams. *TFA Marshmallow* adds some additonal creaminess and sweetens the mix up a bit. *FLV Cream* provides some nice creamy body while not being overbearing on dairy notes.  \n\nI've had success adding in TFA Honeydew, using FA Fresh Cream in place of FLV Cream, FA Meringue, etc. There are a lot of possible ways to take this sort of mix, so feel free to sub in your favorite creams, melons, etc.\n",

    "markdown": "*Disclaimer: I didn't pay for this, shoutout to Flavorah for sending it to me.*\n\n**Setup:** Recoil w/ flavor barrel, Dual 12 wrap 24g 3.5mm SS316 @.33 ohms. 60w power, 450F temp limit. Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Flavorah Yam, 1% and 3%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 18 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Cooked orange sweet potato, headed toward candied yams.\n\nWhat is, in fact, the yams?  I've never had a true yam, but the stuff usually branded as yam in the US is basically an even sweeter and orange sweet potato.  Not having the actual basis of comparison for a true yam, I'll say this does taste a lot like the American colloquial yam.  The yam here tastes surprisingly orange.  It's probably a function of the sweetness more than anything else but it sells the garnet yam kind of profile.  Some contrasting savory and slightly nutty earthy notes start to balance out some of the heavy sweetness, but this tastes sweeter than anything raw or even just baked.\n\nThat sweetness makes me think of candied yams.  It's a bit sticky and almost cloying.  This feels like they've already added some of that brown sugar if not the marshmallows on top.  There's also something buttery here, lending a creamier mouthfeel and some richness.  The butter seems to be a bit more prominent at lower percentages before that yam flavor really saturates.\n\nWith all that candied yam, I still do get some hints of tuber in there.  There's a slightly leathery kind of dry peel note that shows up and gets more prominent at higher percentages.  Strangely accurate to a sweet potato peel, but it's apparently been thoroughly washed because I'm not getting anything distinctly dirty tasting.\n\nModerately dense overall with some starchy, almost chalky notes.  Doesn't quite have the body and graininess of a baked sweet potato, but seems fuller than just a candied yam top note.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Can taste unpeeled with just a bit of earthy leather at higher percentages.  Pre-candied, but that's probably on profile.  Seems to get tarter at higher percentages.  Dairy / Butter notes start to taste a bit sour against that tartness.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light, especially at 1% and under.  Gets a bit tart and dry by 3%.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At .25% I'm getting a good deal of sweetness and some accompanying dairy richness. Very light tartness here but nothing too intense.  Moderate density, but no grainier, starchier texture.  I don't pick up much peel.\n\nAt 1%, this is basically candied yams minus the marshmallows for me.  A bit denser, a bit more textured, and heavily sweet.  Buttery notes are still present and start to stick to your palate and linger after the exhale.  Peel note is just a bit more prominent.  Still has a light tartness, but not more noticeably tart than .25%.  Peel is a bit more prominent but still working more as an earthy accent that feeling unpeeled.\n\nAt 3%, this actually seems a bit less candied.  It's still sweet, but I'm getting some raw peel notes. Tastes slightly earthy and leathery without any less-pleasant dirty off notes.  Seems substantially tarter than 1%, and that tartness is cutting through a lot of the richer, creamy notes and making it taste more raw. Texture doesn't seem noticeably thicker than 1% but those buttery notes get almost sticky on the tail end of the exhale.\n\nJust based on these tests, I'd say this is relatively flexible on percentage.  It's not a FLV flavor like Rhubarb or Fried Dough where an extra drop is going to be a major issue.  Very yammy though, so if I was going to use this an accent flavor between .25-.5. If I was chasing texture as a primary note, I'd probably start at 1% and work up until it got too much of that peel and tartness.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Again, big dumb 'murican palate so I can't really touch on whether this could be hacked into something like an asian or african yam in desserts.  Just tastes like sweet potato to me.\n\nGood fit to fill in pumpkin pie recipes.  Used low, should add \"orange\" depth and richness without dragging in too many of those peel notes.  Should finally turn HS Pumpkin Pie into something thicker and richer for the actual custard base there.\n\nAlso, seems like a natural fit for sweet potato pie or candied yams.  Add a marshmallow that sits on top of a recipe like FA's, and go to town.  Also, if you find the texture lacking, adding some FE Sweet Rice and wait a week for it to stop actually tasting like rice but still give it some starch.\n\nThis already tastes fairly cooked and buttery so it'll be hard to pair outside of those kind of profiles.  Sweet potatos work well in fruit juice blends, but the buttery notes are going to make this hard to use in a non-savory profile.\n\nAlso, when in doubt, just claim that it would work in a tobacco recipe.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Mophead, of mixing with mophead, has a youtube video up.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m4V6zcWzRo)  Just some quick notes from his take: \"Pretty good.\"  More of a sweet potato flavor than TPA Yam. Pretty prominent at .5%. Starchiness, thicker mouthfeel.  Slightly on the savory side.  Use in pumpkin pies, tobaccos, bakeries. Pair with citruses.  Funky at 1.5%.  Starts to pick up squash notes. Keep under 1%.\n\n[No product page or DAAP testing out from FLV yet, but hey... here's a blog post.](https://www.flavorah.com/2018/01/12/yam-flavor/) \"This is a Yam flavor that has a good rich buttery note as well as some sweetness to it, suggested usage rate is between 1-3% depending on its intended use... Yam has a variety of uses whether it be a Sweet Potato recipe or using it with Pumpkin Spice, Tobacco flavors, or even to help create an Ube Cheesecake mix.\"\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

    "markdown": "*Just for transparency sake, these were sent to me from Flavor Monks for the purpose of this review*\n\nHey folks, \n\nThis is my first flavor review over here on DIY_eJuice so bare with me, I'll get better as I go along.  I have been doing reviews for commercial liquids as well as hardware for over a year and a half and I wanted to do something a little different. Over the course of the next few weeks I'll bring reviews ,recipes and notes on Wonder Flavors, Flavorah, FlavourArt,Liquid Barn and Flavor Monks. So stay tuned! \n\nI was sent 15 flavors from the amazing folks at Flavor Monks in Belgium and I can honestly say, these are some really, really top notch flavors. I'll be posting more as often as I can until they're completed. I have also chosen to feature a recipe that I've been working on which compliments this featured flavor as well as some other flavors from Flavorah, FlavourArt and a couple TFA. I hope you enjoy it! Suggestions and feedback are 100% welcome. \n\n**Setup**\n*Lost Vape Therion DNA 166 with an Augvape Druga RDA running dual framed staples(6*.5 Ribbon, 26GSS frames and 40GN80 Wrap)*\n\n**Tested Percentage**\n*10% as recommended on the bottle*\n\n**Main Tasting Notes**\n\nI was a hesitant to mix this at 10% but I figured it was best to stick with the recommendation on the bottle,10% worked really well but the high percentage of stand alone does not translate into a mix the same as I'd treat CAP or TFA. I used this at 2% in a recipe and it was real strong and dominant. I will start off by saying that the authenticity of this Blackberry is astounding, it's unlikely any I've had and I fear of ever running out of it. \n\nOn the inhale I get this real big and juicy dark berry taste. When I say juicy, I mean it. Its this juicyness that had me mixing it into a recipe to try and capture that texture and mouthfeel. The Blackberry hits really quick, as soon as you've noticed that juicy texture the Blackberry is right there with it. The only way that I can describe the taste is via Wild Blackberry. We have them growing all over our farm and I load up on them in the late summer. \n\nTheir taste is distinct and different from a normal Blackberry. They are considerably juicier, much sweeter and have a very strong Blackberry flavor. When I took that first inhale off this, I was instantly reminded of Wild Blackberry. The flavor rolls off your tounge really smoothly on the exhale and the Blackberry forms a bit of tartness but only the slightest,some may not even notice it. The Blackberry after taste lingers for a few second after the exhale than fades.\n\n**Off Flavors**\n Absolutely none, the only thing I am getting here is a really genuine and authentic tasting blackberry. \n\n**Pairings**\n\nThis can fit into just about any fruit mix, keep in mind that even though the solo % is 10%, in a mix this stuff comes across pretty strong so I'd look at .5% for soft background notes and perhaps 1-1.5% for more Blackberry forward notes. \n\n**Recipe**\n\"The Great Grapesby\"\"\n\n- FA Bilberry-0.25%\n- Flavor Monks - Blackberry- 1%\n- FLV Blueberry-0.15\n- TFA Champagne-0.25%\n- FA Fuji-1%\n- FLV Grape-1.75%\n- TFA Marshmallow-1.5%\n- FLV Moscato-0.25%\n- SugarDaddy Sweetner-0.75%(or sweetner of choice)",

    "markdown": "**Setup:** Recoil w/ flavor barrel, Dual 15 wrap 26g 3mm Nifethal 70 coils @.17 ohms.  60w power, 450F temp limit. Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FM Divine Raspberry @ %3, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 22 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Sugary raspberries with a hint of spearmint at 3%. At 5%, a stronger spearmint flavor with some raspberry top notes.  Solid flavor, well-balanced. A little weird for mixing unless the mix of mint and raspberry is exactly what you want. Good solo flavor though.\n\nInhale is warm, moderately dense raspberry. Not quite floral, not quite jammy, and not quite juicy. Maybe a little sweeter than a tarter raspberry, but not nearly as \"candy\" as INW Raspberry.  Exhale is still pretty middle of the road raspberry, with some lighter floral top notes. Solidly sweet, right up to the edge of being a cloying candy sweetness.  Sweetness still feels pretty natural. Mouthfeel, again, is pretty middle of the road. Moderate density, nothing really stands out.  Some light spearmint shows up on the back half of the exhale, really subtle and hard to notice unless you're looking for it. More of a mint flavor, than a cooling sensation. Helps to clean up some of the sweetness you're getting on the front end of the exhale. Blends well, and makes this taste quite a bit more \"fresh\" on the finish.  Some of that lingering mint and some sugary mouthfeel.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Advertised as raspberries with a \"mint breeze\", so not really.  Maybe more mint than I'd expect at higher percentages.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light, nothing too major.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Good solo. That mint does quite a bit to make this more interesting.  I think you could probably bludgeon this into a bakery, but I'd just roll with the mint here and use it as a component in a fruit mix or a candy.  Should pair well with candy texturizers, and probably just about any fruit you want to throw it at it. I wouldn't mind just a bit of koolada to reinforce the mint flavor with a stronger cooling effect. I also love raspberry with rhubarb, so INW Rhubarb... but YMMV depending on your own appreciation of rhubarb.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nS&V concentration testing, 1% is pretty light and floral. 2% is still a bit light, but the raspberry is shaping up pretty well. 3% has that raspberry fairly well saturated with just a light hit of mint. 4% is getting just a bit floral but that spearmint is getting much fuller and kind of interesting. Some cooling showing up. 5% seems like the sweet spot for the mint, although that raspberry is starting to lose what juiciness it's got. I'd mix with this at 3% if you're primarily after the raspberry with just a hint of mint. I'd actually bump this up to about 5% in your fruit mixes if you plan on bringing some other juicier, fruits in.\n\nI'm a big fan of raspberry, and this is fundamentally decent. Nothing revolutionary, but it's well-balanced and that mint hit is nice but may ultimately limit the concentrates utility for mixing.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Website copy:](http://www.flavormonks.com/product/divine-raspberry-flavor/)\n\n\"Raspberry, without a doubt one of the most delicious fruits on the planet. So, we challenged ourselves and pimped the raspberry to a Royal Raspberry. Enjoy the velvet raspberry taste, touched with a subtle mint breeze. A flavor that certainly belongs in our Divine series.\"\n\n[Google Translated reviews from the dutch version of the flavormonks site:](\n\n\"delicious natural flavor of raspberry with a fresh flavor of ice cream, perfect for hot days.\"\n\nand excerpt from the dutch novel on there from user \"Raf Geurts\":\n\n\"You taste clearly sweetened and some soft Raspberry, the taste is slightly lighter than a true Raspberry, this is a bit on the fresh touch of mint, the fresh (Mint) complements this well without the raspberry dominates. The Mint makes the raspberry flavor a bit lighter and fresher... A very successful combination that is very balanced and round and somewhat soft, but also leaves a fresh taste experience.\n\nThe taste is delicious sizzle after in the mouth, on the lips is the flavor very quickly, but it remains fresh stick longer.\n\nAlmost Sugar Lips.\n\nPersonally I'm not a big fan of menthol or mint, but in this Divine Raspberry comes to dominate or change the mint it into its own and without Raspberry flavor.\"\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FM Drop @ %3, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 21 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Black Licorice all the way. Definitely a candy flavor. Initial impressions are really anise forward, but becomes a lot more mellow after the first couple draws.  Once it settles in,  balanced anise notes with a solid molasses type of sweetness. Fuller mouthfeel, with some actual density. Has a tiny bit of sour tinge to it solo, but overall the most accurate licorice candy I've come across.\n\nInhale has a slight sourness, with deeper building black licorice sweetness.  Mouthfeel has a moderate density, not thin or astringent. Exhale has heavy anise top notes. The base sourness makes it taste a bit more like licorice root than straight bakery anise. Deeper molasses kind of sweetness builds and gets more pronounced toward the back half of the exhale. Moderate density, with some actual body. Sweetness level overall seems pretty appropriate for a llcorice candy. Lingering, slightly medicinal black licorice candy taste, with that anise kind of coating your mouth.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Slight sourness I'm not a fan of. Really shows up as your palate tunes out the spicier licorice notes.\n\n**Throat Hit:**Light, mostly from chest tightness on the inhale. Definitely numbs your mouth a bit as well.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I'm assuming you like black licorice, because this is never not going to taste like black licorice. Really solid as a solo, with maybe a touch of sucralose to balance out that sour note.  I'd go so far as to call this the black licorice candy flavor to beat, so use this accordingly. Good base for something like a good and plenty.  No earthly idea how you'd do it, but would work well as the licorice component in a liquourice all-sorts flavor.\n\nAfter that, it gets weird. I'm a huge fan of licorice ice cream (shoutout to Molly Moon's in Seattle.)  Herbal pairings are cool, like horehound or a natural spearmint. For fruit flavors I like apple, raspberry, and coconut.\n\n**Notes:**\nS&V concentration testing, 1% is pretty blah. Some light sourness and anise tingle without much body or sweetness. 2% is mostly anise, still no body and the sweetness is really subdued. 3% is still a bit thin. 4% has a heavier licorice hit, and that sweetness is dead on. 5% is getting pretty intense, and by 7% this is just too much for me.  I'd recommend mixing with this at 3% as a flavor component in a more complex mix with fruit or creams, and 5% as the primary note in a black licorice candy.\n\nMain competitor for this is probably FA Black Touch, but that's definitely more an herbal licorice tea kind of flavor. This works better as a more realistic and complex black licorice candy.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nNot a whole lot.  Only reviews I can find are off the flavormonks website.\n\n[First one is from the english version:](http://www.flavormonks.com/product/drop-concentrated-flavor/)\n\n\"This one is really nice, not too strong\nI’ve made a delicious recipe, 30 ml. drop 10%, lemon 4%\"\n\n[Next two are from the dutch version, via google translate:](http://www.flavormonks.be/product/drop/)\n\n\"blissfully delicious taste of sweet licorice. aniseed makes it nice and cool on hot days. Ratio of 10% is more than adequate.\"\n\n\"There is little to say about it. It tastes like what the name says, namely, drop, without any weird off-flavors. So this is a flavor for the real licorice lovers.\"\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FM Gin Orange @ %3, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 19 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** FM Pure Gin, heavy on the orange peel. More like a gin made with fruit, rather than a fruit mixed with gin like the rest of the FM gin line.  Orange peel note has a bit of warmth, a lot like bergamot.  Undermines a lot of the complex herbal finish, but keeps a good juniper berry hit. Overall fairly harsh and dry solo, though.\n\nInhale is mostly top notes. Lots of juniper right of the bat, with building bitter orange/bergamot zest.  A bit thin, with no real bottom end.  Exhale is really top heavy, again with that juniper first and then a warm, almost peppery bergamot, citrus zest type of flavor. Herbal notes and citrus zest blend on the tail end, with a lingering dry, bitter, citrus.  Some base tangerine sweetness, but all that flavor kind of lives in the top notes.  Noticeably drier than the other FM gins.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Nah, texture is noticeably less forgiving than the other FM Gin mixes, but I get bitter orange zest and gin notes.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Moderate. Citrus note is pretty harsh.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Much more of a straight ahead gin than a fruit mix. Good start for gin and citrus cocktails, although I'd stick to juicier citrus because this already has most of the zest you're going to want.  Also needs some additional wetness, so probably needs some cactus or cucumber to get your wetness back.\n\nOtherwise, use pretty much like you would FA Gin or FM Pure Gin.  Good for gin cocktails or a low percentage to add interest to your fruit mixes.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nS&V concentration testing, at 1% this is all orange zest. Actually pretty spot on. At 2%, the juniper shows up big.  At 3% the herbal back end of the juice cuts through the juniper a bit and it the concentrate gets bergamot-y. At 4% the orange takes a bit of a backseat to the gin, and by 5% its pretty much a gin made with orange peel.  I'd mix this in a fruit mix for the orange zest at 1%, 3% for a lighter gin accent in a cocktail, and 4% as a primary gin note in a cocktail vape.\n\nSeems like the most useful of the FM gin line besides the pure gin for actually mixing. Too dry and aggressive for solo mixing, but a good gin to build a more traditional gin cocktail recipe around.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Couple reviews from the Flavormonks website:](http://www.flavormonks.com/product/gin-orange-concentrated-flavor/)\n\n\"Taste exactly like the description says. Gin with orange. A bit bitter, but thats normal. Really good.\"\n\nGoogle translate, original review auf Deutsch:\n\n\"For my taste it is a bit too much orange flavor. The Gin comes out well! No all-day, but every now and then very tasty. Also mixed with \"boring\" fruit liquids very well.\"\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FM Gin in Paris @ %3, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 16 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Gin, with candy banana and orange zest.  More of a fruit smoothie if you squint a bit, the herbal notes from the gin pass as some wheatgrass or spirulina.\n\nGin on the inhale, higher juniper top notes with a building soft, creamy banana base. Gin is clearer on the inhale here than most of the other FM Gin mixes.  Exhale has banana up front, mostly soft and creamy with just a hint of that bright yellow candy banana flavor. Orange zest and juniper top notes. Tail end of the exhale gets a nice complex gin finish, with that orange zest really complementing the herbal gin notes.  Fairly dense, but with a really appropriate level of sweetness. \n\n**Off-flavors:** Nah, it's unique but nothing that really clashes or doesn't fit.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Not really. Orange zest makes your mouth tingle a bit, but seems okay on the throat.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Solo? This is an odd flavor to think about mixing.  You got some distinct gin, creamy candy banana, and that nice orange zest accent. It's fairly full and engaging by itself.\n\nYou could use this as a base and try to sort of distract away from the gin notes with a brighter fruit flavor. I'd mix this with strawberry, a bright raspberry, or maybe a cherry to fill out the fruit profile and push those gin notes to a supporting player while taking advantage of the solid banana and orange zest.\n\nOr, you could get weird with it. You could take advantage of the herbal notes and get some green into the mix to pull off a fairly authentic smoothie flavor. Adding in something intensely green like FLV Basil, InW Rhubarb, or FA Jasmine is going to take the herbal notes and push towards something like wheatgrass.  Some additional juice like FLV Mango or INW Pineapple, or even CAP Cucumber if you want a more savory take, will get you even closer to a straight health food kind of smoothie.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nS&V concentration testing, at 1% I get a lot the density from the banana, if not the actual flavor and some nice orange zest top notes. At 2%, that orange zest is pretty prominent, with juniper notes backing it up.  Overall effect tastes a lot like the peel on the orange, rind and all.  3% seems pretty balanced, with juniper getting a bit more distinct and those herbal notes coming out on tail end. Banana flavor also takes on some of that candy note. 4% i get a fuller orange flavor, and the gin notes are becoming fairly aggressive.  The banana is starting to get a bit of a clove flavor in there as well. At 5% banana is reading full runts with cloves, and the gin is up-front, with the orange peel just another component in the gin mix.  I'd mix with this at 1% if you want some extra banana volume and light zest notes in a fruit mix, 2% if you want that rindy orange note, and 3% if you to go the smoothie route.  4% seems like the play if you're more after the gin note, but you've got to deal with that banana hanging around in the background.  Solo, I'd go 4% just because that clove note is really interesting.\n\nSo this is really solidly constructed and interesting, I'm just not sold on how the hell I'm going to use it. It's a good concentrate, with some really niche applications. I've never had the chance to go to paris, but I'm curious if they actually put bananas in their gin.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[One review on the flavormonks website, google translated from Dutch:](http://www.flavormonks.be/product/gininparis/)\n\n\"Special! Usually one uses this word in case one does not find something tasty. this is not the case in the case of Gin in Paris. At the first sips vapor you inhale you notice immediately that you're dealing with a special flavor. It is spicy and fresh without dominating. Just nice, although you might first have to empty tank of fumes before you can appreciate it fully. For me it's a hit, though he will not and should not be vape all day for me. Before that he is special, and you run the risk that you might be tired of him. That would be a waste!\"\n\nThis special gin man sounds lovely.\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Good complex quinine biterness but the sweetness here tastes a little artificial. A lot like a gin and tonic, just a bit too heavy on store-brand diet tonic water.\n\nInhale has a little harsh and thin, mostly juniper. Exhale is mostly quinine, honestly.  Bitter lime zest and juniper top notes, but a full accurate tonic water quinine. Light to moderate density.  Tonic note is a bit one-dimensional, but most tonic water tends to be.

My white wale for green apple ended with this one. Even though its pricey its totally worth it. Body wise, i can compare it with FA fuji apple. It holds his place against other strong flavors like FLV spearmint for example, making it versatile. Doesn't require much tweaking, and no nail polish off notes... do i need to say more? :)",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Flavor Monks Mango @ 4%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 17 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Ripe, fairly realistic mango. Flavor is a bit top heavy and dry.  Really nice perfumey ripe mango notes without enough juicyness or flesh underneath.\n\nNothing much on the inhale, light sweetness. Flavor is mostly on the exhale.  Relatively thin, and not quite sweet enough.  Good balance of fruit and peel.  Fruit tastes ripe-ish and the peel notes aren't overbearing or artificial.  Mouthfeel has a bit of lingering stickiness.  Some interesting buttery notes as the wick dries out.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Top notes can get just a bit bitter with extended use.\n\n**Throat Hit:** 0/10.  A bit perfumey but not especially bright or harsh.\n\n**Uses:**  So frustratingly close to a single flavor mango. I'd use this with FLV Mango to make a fuller, sweeter, juicy mango.  Good candidate for mixing with juicier fruits.\n\n**Pairings:** Deeper juicy mango like CAP or FLV. Tropical fruits. Creams. May be a good mango for rich bakeries.  Dark chocolate.  Distinct perfume notes, so I'd avoid any other perfumey fruits.\n\n**Notes:** At 2%, I'm getting even less of the ripe mango flavor, and just a muted perfume.  4% seems like a good starting point for mixing with other flavors, but it doesn't seem quite saturated.  I'd feel comfortable taking that up farther to about 8% as a main note. This came to me as a premixed sample at 4%, so that's just an educated guess.  Flavormonks recommends 10%, and that might be closer to the mark.  The actual mango here seems pretty linear, and the perfume bitterness isn't scaling up as fast.\n\nAs a 'murican, this definitely isn't something I'd order specifically from europe.  If you already have business on chef's flavours and are interested, it's probably worth checking out, although mixing at 10% would get expensive pretty fast.\n\nShoutout to /u/apexified for the sample.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nPretty damn sparse.\n\n[This review calls it bland, but then dumps a bunch of sweetener in and takes it up to 20%](http://www.dampforum.nu/topic/34738-flavormonks-mango/)\n\n[One review on their belgian site, calling it realistic without off-flavors](http://www.flavormonks.be/product/mango/)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

And eGo aio with .6 oms.\n\nTested at 10%(solo) with 4 weeks steeping, 3%(solo), 0.25%(recipe) 1 week steeping. 70/30.\n\nA friend of mine gave me to try a bit of \"Tabacco Bastards No.21 Mint By FlavorMonks\". In Their site we can read:\n\n>*Flavor description:*  \n>  \n>Pure generic tobacco flavor with a natural mint taste. A perfectly  balanced medium-strong minty flavor for a refreshing throat-hit. \n\nAnd what i got was a super rich cream without vanilla notes with a very faint tobacco note in the background that i couldn't identify. But the cream was really \"fluffy\" and well balanced with the mint. Since they only have one mint, i thought i could had my favorite tobaccos ... and its a waste of 7 euros for a 10ml's of this. Those mother fu$&$& are expensive as shit. And this one is definitely a miss. This backstory will make sense.\n\n**Expectations:** A super creamy leafy spearmint. I mean... 7 euros for a bottle. Give me the best spearmint ever... right?\n\n**What will you get?** Eucalyptus, spearmint, cream, sweet, shit ton of coolness. Too much things going on really limiting the uses of this flavoring. At the end of the day for me in the back of my mind this is more of a one shot then a single flavor. WTF?!?!?\n\n**Solo flavor test at 3% on the hadaly:** The Eucalyptus part is what it is. I can't tell a difference about this one or vt Eucalyptus Robusta. On the inhale this is the top note that you will taste. As second note you will get the spearmint part delicious realistic. Good body to it, without any leafy notes or off notes even at this high for a RDA. I don't have SC spearmint (yet) to compare it realistic wise, but this one is definitely more realistic then flv spearmint. Under all, but blending with the spearmint we have a really sweet cream with a really great body! Its thicker then flv cream/flv whipped cream (without the vanilla, butter). The mouth feel if really rich, at this high it felt i was vaping the fluffiness of FA cream fresh at 2% without the milk notes ... just a mouthful light sweet cream. Wish they sold this cream in a separate flavor without any of those extras. And the  cooling effect is super super high. Imagine 1% of ws-5 with 0.4 of ws-23. All the flavors are really well balanced though... except for the cooling effect. Didn't noticed a difference with steeping either.\n\nMy sweet spot with menthol is  .4% of ws-5 with 1% ws-23... and 3% was unbearable freshly dripped.\n\n**10% on a eGo aio MTL:**  Yep, i get everything that i wrote up above. Really well balanced, very nice one shot for pod systems too for sure.\n\n**0.25% on a recipe:** Now here's the major problem with this flavor. Its a fucking muting monster. That's why on the \"Tabacco Bastards No.21 Mint by Flavormonks\" the tobacco is so faint. I mean, .25 of this totally vanished 1% of TPA orance cream. lol 4% inw pinnaple with 2% cap golden pinnaple? gone! .5% inw grape? gone. Either you go the your strongest single flavor top note or it will disappear. The only one that i could taste was .5% inw shisha orange in a mix... till i quite on this flavor all together.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Super smooth.\n\n**Off-flavors:** None. Zero leafy notes, peppermint, wintergreen, or any other flavors then those described.\n\n**Suggested pairings**: Pair it with a super strong top note tobacco of your choice and crank it high on your pod or MTL and you're good to go. Anything else... forget it. Pick flavors that won't mute fruits, adapt your base.  'cause the only thing this one won't mute its your frustration. Have fun making your own version of this instead.\n\nIf i wanted to mimic this flavor at 3% i would start with something like this:\n\n2% vt Eucalyptus Robusta.\n\ntry to find a good realistic spearmint and put it as much as you would put 1% flv spearmint (great spearmint, but candy)\n\n2% flv cream equivalent\n\n.2 cap super sweet\n\n1% ws-5 (ugh)\n\n.4% ws-23",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FM OMGin @ %3, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 15 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** More of a mixed berry flavor with gin, as opposed to a straight gin made with berries.  Slightly artificial but well-balanced berry flavor with some interesting juniper top notes and a complicated gin finish.\n\nInhale starts light, with juniper top notes. Turns moderately dense with a deep berry sweetness building through the inhale.  Exhale has a mixed berry flavor up front, with a candy raspberry kind of vibe and juniper top notes. Overall effect tastes just a bit artificial, but with a nice warm sweetness and moderate density. Juniper takes over on the tail end of the exhale with just a touch of the herbaceousness you get from FM Pure Gin.  Lingering sweetness and high green and astringent top notes. \n\n**Off-flavors:**  Berry flavor here does taste a bit artificial.  More of a flat \"mixed berry\" than a mix of actual berries.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Light, mostly from the berries strangely enough.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This will definitely work as a solo flavor at 3-5% depending on how sweet and strong you want your vape.  The one thing I feel like this is crying out for solo is a bit of carbonation and a lime twist.  FA Aurora at .25 to .5% will give you both.  In the same vein, could use just a bit of cooling, either from a low percentage of Koolada or a more natural mint. I push it a lot, but I really like INW Natural Mint with this, reinforcing some of the herbal notes and adding some light cooling.\n\nMixing this, you could definitely try /u/HocusKrokus/ 's [Grape Germaine](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/5kkk21/grape_germaine_a_study_in_abstract_cocktails/).  That mixed berry flavor bolsters the grape and utilizes that artificial note to give a fuller grape candy. Adding some other fruit is probably a good idea just to take it away from that artificial flavor. Just as a S&V, something a little more realistic like FA Raspberry or more vibrant like FA Blackcurrant does wonders.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nS&V concentration testing, 1% is pretty heavy on the berry flavor but light overall. That herbal note at the back ends up tasting fairly bitter. 2% has the gin notes pick up a bit, giving some weight to that thin and bitter back end while the berry stays fairly subtle. At 3% that berry picks up quite a bit. At 4%, the berry gets a bit syrupy and flat, which helps the gin out a bit. Fairly sweet overall by 5%. Usage percentage on this is pretty versatile and going to depend heavy on application. If you want this as just an interesting berry component in a mix, I'd use 2%. If you want a gin-forward mix but want to use additional fruit flavors I'd mix with this at 3%. As a primary flavor, with either some citrus or cooling to cut the syrupy-vibe here, I'd mix at 4 or 5%.\n\nFlavourmonks says this is a mix of their forest fruit flavor and gin base, and I think their forest fruit mix might be the limiting factor. I love the idea, but I'm not 100% sold on their berry mix here. Still fairly good, but that artificial note kind of kills it for me a bit.\n \n**Second Opinions:**\n\nSo, /u/HocusKrokus is definitely a fan. In the comments for [FM Pure Gin](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/5pr9b3/flavourmonks_pure_gin/) he states: \"I like OMGin a touch better, I think because OMGin doesn't go as Juniper forward at slightly higher percentages, and I pick up a hint of bitters/vermouth that I really enjoy.\" and in that [Grape Germaine recipe](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/5kkk21/grape_germaine_a_study_in_abstract_cocktails/) describes this flavor as: \"Hands down my favorite gin from their line. It's simply super versatile. At 3% it stands out just enough to cut through some of the thicker sweet notes in the grape base and support those light floral notes in the FLV Elderflower. For those unfamiliar with Flavor Monks Gin line I highly recommend FM OMGin. It's a very bright, clean gin flavor that tastes of fresh juniper berries, and absolutely no awkward pine/cheap shitty fin flavors. It's an excellently realized top shelf gin flavor.\"\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Running Dual framed staples @0.08ohm. 6x.5 Ribbon,26GSS Frames,40G N80 Wrap*\n\n**Tested Percentage**\n\n*10% as recommended on the bottle*\n\n**Off Flavors**\n\n*Absolutely None, authenticity is off the charts with this one*\n\n**Main Flavor Notes**\n\nIf it counts for anything, Orange is one flavor that I have generally not agreed with. In commercial juice or DIY. It always comes out harsh or candy like and I can't usually tolerate much of it. I've tried several variations of orange concentrates and some are definitely considerably better than others. I think the best I've had previous to this was Blood Orange from FA and I did enjoy that one.\n\nFlavor Monks orange is straight up orange. No off tastes or candy tones. The authenticity is off the charts. The orange citrus is real strong and it tastes exactly like an orange, I mean it, exactly like an orange! I could vape this solo with a touch of sweetner and be happy. I did find that the overall tone of the orange changes slightly from the inhale to the exhale. Inhaling I find it's more of a natural pure tasting orange zest where as the exhale is tasting just like the fruit. I would relate this to something of a mix between a navel orange and a clementine. I say clementine because of that sour but sweet and tangy taste they have and I do catch some of that over top the orange taste. Overall, this is the best orange I have had and will cherish what I have of it.  \n\nThis orange is one of their 100% naturally produced flavors. Others include lemon,lime and gin flavors. \n\n**Possible Pairings**\n\nThis is going to go well in about any fruit mix. As with the other flavor monks flavors I've tested, while the solo is high at 10%, in a mix these seem to be a while different beast. I'd tame this at around 1.5-2% for a full frontal orange note or 0.5-1% for a mild citrus back note. Either way you use it, this is something you'll want to keep in your arsenal at all times.",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FM Pure Gin @ %3, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 14 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Gin, basically. Fairly soft, with a flavor that is both cleaner and more nuanced than FA Gin. Juniper berries, and a crisp herbal note with some dandelion, citrus peel, and warm mild black pepper heat.  Overall effect is a little astringent and boozy, which is spot on for a gin.\n\nInhale is soft and wet, with a hint of a very green herbal flavor and some lightly tart citrus.  Sweetness seems right on point. Exhale opens up into Juniper berries with some soft floral top notes. Back half of the exhale gets boozy, with a raw alcohol mouthfeel. Those herbal flavors really show up after the juniper fades a bit. I get green, astringent dandelion, some bitter orange top notes, and an overall kind of warmth that feels a lot like the warmth you get from pink peppercorns or even grains of paradise. Softer than black pepper, without those sharper musky notes and intense spice.  Sweetness is just enough to complement the flavor here, with no added sugary-ness.  Those alcohol, juniper, and citrus top notes linger a bit.  Overall mouthfeel seems more \"soft\" than \"thin\" as it's a well-rounded flavor that just isn't too overbearing as opposed to one-note without a ton of body.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Nah. Definitely reads \"gin.\"\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Not really, makes your mouth tingling a bit but pretty smooth for a gin flavor.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I think this addresses most of the mouthfeel issues you get from FA Gin. It's wetter in general, and I don't feel like the cucumber or cactus backup is essential.  It is noticeably weaker, so you'll have to bump up to 4% or even 5% for a strong primary gin note in a cocktail, but even at those levels it should play well and actually mix in a recipe instead of tasting like a spike of juniper right up front.\n\nThis isn't as aggressive as FA Gin, and so fruit pairings with the gin as a supporting player are going to be a lot easier.  It'll still end up tasting like juniper mixed with your fruit, but it'll add some wetness and interest wihtout just blowing out your taste buds. I'd still mix this with darker berries, but the effect will be quite a bit more pleasant.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nFlavormonks suggests mixing at 10%. I think that's overboard, and I really like the subtle complexity and balance lower than that.  S&V concentration testing, 1 and 2% are pretty light.  At 1% you get mostly those green herbal kind of notes. 2% has a bit more of that fuller juniper taste and you get a bit of the booze here. More of a floral down low, so may work as a accent in places you wouldn't expect. 3% is about the minimum for a fuller gin taste. Above 3% the boldness of the juniper increases. By 4% I'd call it juniper forward, and at 5% percent I hit my personal limit, as the juniper note gets distinctly woody.  I'd mix with at 2% for an accent for fruit mixes, 3% for a subtle hit of gin in a fruitier cocktail, and 4-5% for a strong, bold gin flavor.\n\nIf it didn't come across, I really like this. If you are in the market for a really good, bordering on great straight gin flavor this is definitely my pick.  It is a bit harder to source than FA Gin, though. \n\nI'll be going through the rest of the Flavourmonks gin line this week and a couple other scattered Flavourmonks and Decadent Vapours concentrates. Some of these European concentrates have a bit of mystery to them, but it isn't too hard to get your hands on if you are American. [Chef's Flavours](https://www.chefsflavours.co.uk/) has 10mls of this for £2, which translates to $2.50 in 'murican dollars according to google.  Shipping isn't all that bad either, costing me about $6.25 for a $50 dollar order and I got it within 2 weeks.  Sorry for the Chef's Flavours plug, just trying to illustrate that these concentrates aren't nearly that unobtainable.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Nothing much that I can find.  You can have some website copy though:](https://www.chefsflavours.co.uk/flavormonks/4696-pure-gin.html?search_query=pure+gin&results=7)\n\n\"Our Gin concentrated flavors are freshly handmade with all natural products, straight out of our own botanical garden. We use 14 botanical agents and herbs to get a top-notch gin. Because it’s superfresh handmade the steeping period is at least 9 days. More PG gives it a more juniper taste, while it gets more mild with more VG. It’s your mix, you decide.\"\n\nThat's some weapons-grade marketing bullshit there, but this is pretty damn good.\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FM Red Gin @ %3, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 17 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Gin and cherries.  Flavormonks website says dark cherries, but I get a lot more of a bright red candy cherry flavor, more cherry cough drop than actual fruit.  Cherry itself is very sweet, but that gin base helps to clean up the exhale and keeps some of the stickiness on the toungue instead of your sinuses.\n\nInhale has some faint juniper top notes, and a full cherry sweetness.  Exhale opens up into cherry candy with the same kind of light juniper top notes. Herbal parts on the gin come in on the back half of the exhale, drying out the exhale a bit and adding some bitter complexity to that sweet cherry candy flavor. Gin notes linger in the sinuses, while you get a sweeter almost sticky mouthfeel on the toungue. Overall effect is moderately dense, and on the sweet side but complex enough to avoid being cloying.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  That cherry is more than a touch artifical tasting, with the herbal components of the gin bringing in a bit of medicinal character. Not bad, but it definitely doesn't taste like real cherry juice mixed with gin.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Light, mostly from the cherry.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:** So it may be a bit of a reach, but this tastes a lot like a slightly candy version of Maraschino Liqueur (like the good, luxardo stuff.)  The Cherry note here is definitely on the sweet side, but the juniper is relatively sedate and the herbal notes kind of play into the whole bitter-sweet complex thing that maraschino liqueur has going on.  I'd mix with this like a maraschino stand-in.  Just a shake and vape I'm getting a pretty acceptable Blood and Sand riff by using some FA Whisky, FM Red Gin, and a bit of JF Juicy Lemon.  Also getting a fairly decent Aviation with some extra FM Pure Gin, FM Red Gin, Juicy Lemon, and a bit of FA Violet.  [Looks like Sejouced on ELR already beat me to the punch here.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/recipe/1016242/Aviator%20%28FM%20Gin%20series%29) I think has serious legs as a cocktail vape mixer.\n\nI can also see this as a background note in a fruit vape, to give some more vibrancy and sweetness to a mix. I'd pair with apples, raspberries, or even grapefruit but it'll probably work with just about anything if you're after some of those more herbal notes.\n\n**Notes:**  S&V concentration testing, seems to work a lot like the other FM gins. Light fruit flavor at 1% and 2%. Juniper and gin notes start to come toward the front at 3% and get more pronounced after that. Syrupy sweetness gets a little more round after 3%, pushing towards straight robotussin by 5% or 6%. I'd mix with this at 4% for a maraschino liquer type of effect, and maybe 2% for adding an extra dimension to a fruit mix.\n\nThe artificiality of the cherry note bothers me less than the mixed berry note in OMGin. Cherry is quite a bit harder to do in general, and I feel like the bitter notes add up to an interesting concentrate.  Cherry note here is actually pretty solid for a candy cherry.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nI'm not finding anything, so please share your experience with the concentrate if you have it.\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

I was warned ahead of time that if I were to vape this straight, my coils would only last a few rounds. Obviously, I didn't do that but the results were still quite the same. I'm absolutely in love with this flavor, it's perhaps in my top 10 of all time. The tough part is finding the balance between sweetness and flavor. \n\nAs the title states, this is part of their Sweet Betsy like which essentially took flavors from their various other lines and sweetened them up. The thing I love about this is that the sweet taste does not give off any chemical sweet tastes, it's really clean and packed with flavor. In all honesty, I refilled my dripper maybe 10 times before I had to rewick. Each time I filled, I got 15-20 good hauls off it. My coils were pretty wrecked and there was no pushing it forward.\n\nThe cookie flavor though, it's absolutely unreal. It has this really warm fresh baked feeling to it. It is quite grainy and crunchy, if that makes sense. The taste, to me is like a chocolate chip cookie, minus the chocolate chips. The cookie has a nice warm buttery texture/feel to it and complimented by the sweetness of everything, it is unlike any cookie I've had. If I had to make a comparison I'd say it's something like a combination of CAP Sugar Cookie, FA Cookie and maybe a touch of INW Biscuit. Throw in some smooth Buttery texture and that's what Sweet Betsy Cookie is. Either way you cut it, this is exceptional.\n\n**Off Flavors**\n\nSurprisingly, there are none. I thought with this being so sweet,I'd get some burnt sugars or something but the whole thing comes across really clean\n\n**Possible Pairings**\n\nOk, so here's where it gets a bit tricky. Stand alone at 10%, the flavor is really really nice. Downside is the destruction of coils. I think going down to 5% might improve it a bit but I'm getting the feeling this is more of an additive than a main flavor note. It does work really well with the Butter Cookie flavor from Flavor Monks. I placed it in there with FLV Sweet Coconut,FLV Hazelnut and a touch of INW Biscuit. I placed it at 0.75% and I could definitely pick up on its subtle notes. The sweetness was just right but the wear on coils was still a bit more than normal. Its worth noting that when I first made this mix, I used the SB Cookie at 4% and it was far too high. Overall, the flavor is amazing, just treat this as a additive like a sweetner but keeping in mind it has a flavor profile to it.",

I can definitely taste the gin in here, but the fruit note is almost creamy without any kind of berry juiciness.  It's like a banana-gin smoothie. It's not bad, I guess. Just weird.\n\nInhale has high juniper top notes, with a pretty distinct banana sweetness. Exhale starts off with the same juniper top notes, with that green banana coming out of the back end of the exhale. Overall moderately dense and with a really natural and solid level of sweetness. Kind of mess on the tail end, as the greener notes from the gin blend with that underripe banana and get really swampy, for lack of better word.  Seems to get really weird as your wicks dry out a bit.  What I don't get anywhere in here is raspberry. Maybe a hint of brightness, but it honestly has that flat kind of CAP Golden Pineapple note.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Dude, this tastes a lot like bananas.  It's the weirdest thing, actually a whole lot like a greener version of FA Banana or like /u/Philosaphucker/ 's [Detox](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/15465#detox_by_philosaphucker) with a lot more cactus.\n\n**Throat Hit:**Nah.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I'm a little stumped with this one. It's a bit weird to run as a solo flavor.  The gin isn't heavy enough to mix using that as a primary note. And that banana flavor is super green and gets downright vegetal.  I suppose you could add some citrus or something to brighten the entire thing up with maybe some mango and coconut for a more tiny umbrella type of gin cocktail, but underripe bananas and gin just don't strike me as an awesome thing to try to find a complement for.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nS&V concentration testing, at 1% i get a lot of banana and almost a berry kind of brightness but no real gin.  2% almost tastes like ripe mango mixed with marshmallow, as it's kind of sweet and creamy with just touch of brightness and the gin manages to come across as just a little bit of a juniper top note that mimics a mango peel.  3% seems to be where the juniper really kicks in and that banana gets pretty underipe. Juniper keeps scaling up from there and it's pretty unpleasant over 3%.  Seems to be a common thing with the FM Gin line, the juniper and gin specific notes just take off over 3%. I'd mix with this at 2% as a component in an umbrella drink type mix or maybe 3% if you're adding another heavy fruit in to try to salvage the concentrate.\n\nI don't know, this is super weird and I can't really think of a damn thing I want to do with this.  Thought originally this may have been a mixed up bottling with \"Gin in Paris\" because that's supposed to have a banana component but it's not. Gin in Paris is definitely different. I'm mystified here, and I'd probably skip this one.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[The flavourmonks website has a couple of 5-star reviews:](http://www.flavormonks.be/product/vero-gin/#reviews)\n\nGoogle-translated from dutch:\n\n\"This is one of the most unique flavors I have ever tasted, once you open the bottle you just think to open a bottle of gin. After 9 days steepen this is a nice change compared to the sweet taste that I normally vapor.\nThe gin is still very prevalent, so the raspberry is very slightly around the corner from me. For the 'drank'dampers this is a wonderful mix!\"\n\nand\n\n\"my favorite, gin with a subtle touch of raspberry, I vapor for 3 years and in the meantime this is the best I've ever evaporated\"\n\nBoth of these reviews are saying that raspberry is subtle, so maybe it's just too subtle or there is something being used that I'm not picking up.\n\nDidn't find a whole lot else out there.\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Not full-on frosting, but that same kind of bright vanilla note.  Moderate vanilla overall, but sticks out quite against a more mellow cream.  Vanilla gets slightly chemical and bitter with extended vaping.\n\nLight and nondescript richness here.  Somewhere between buttery and waxy. Nothing butryic or too aggressive, but very little identifiable dairy taste.  Vanilla dominates most of the vape, but some dairy sneaks in on the back end.  I get more dairy on the breath after vaping this, then during the actual vape.\n\nThe mouthfeel on this is interesting.  Its moderately full but fairly dry.  Vanilla makes it seem a bit more lively in the top notes than something like FA Fresh Cream, but lacking some of the richer base and mouthfeel.  Almost seems a bit fluffy compared to a flatter cream flavor.  The vanilla, lack of dairy notes, and the fluffiness definitely leans towards a whipped cream bordering on a drier marshmallow or meringue flavor.\n\n**Off-Flavors:**  Pretty solid vanilla hit for a straight cream flavor. Gets a bit bitter solo.  Dry, fluffy texture.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light, mostly from the dryness.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 1%,  this is pretty dry and light on flavor.  Soft vanilla, not much actual cream.\n\nAt 3%,  this feels a bit fuller.  I'm still getting some dryness in the middle of the flavor but the base is a bit richer.  Vanilla is getting pretty aggressive, and doesn't really mesh with the lighter dairy notes all that well.\n\nJust based on these tests, I'd probably start out around their suggested 2% with this one.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:** I'd probably use more like a whipped cream for layering.  Probably a better fit for bakeries than trying to use in a milkier profile.  The vanilla could kind of stand in for a cereal malt in a cereal milk, but the dryer texture is going to sit on top of bakery bases rather than really fill in the gaps.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  I can't really find anything out there on this one.\n\n[I've only seen these at Nicotine River.

Moderate eggy note, but no real dairy richness. Lighter take on custard in general... but then there is the butryic acid.  Even at 1% with over a month worth of a steep, this still tastes sour to me. It's not full on rancid like FA Yogurt at a month, but it's pretty prominent here.  After a month, the more vomity parts of this have mostly steeped out, but it still feels distractingly tart.  I know it's not the most accurate benchmark for vaping experience, but you get a face full of those sour notes when you're actually smelling the concentrate and in the room note.\n\nFlavor Revolution has a vanilla custard flavor, but I still think I'm getting a lighter vanilla.  Seems to have a light cinnamon kind of spice note to it as well.\n\nModerately dense overall, but seems on the thinner side for a custard.  I'm not getting that really heavy, smooth custard type base.  Seems to be a bit chalky and dry as opposed to buttery and rich.  Sweetness level feels pretty much on point, sweetened but not cloyingly frosting sweet.\n\nI don't have a comprehensive basis of comparison for custard flavors, but this isn't nearly as thick and rich as CAP V1 or INW Custard.  Maybe a bit thinner than FA with a heavier butyric note.  Actually reminds me quite a bit of FLV's straight custard flavor but that's missing the more aggressive sourness.\n\n**Off-Flavors:**  DAAP Free, but fairly heavy sour butryic note.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light.  Gets a bit chalky and dry for me.  Nothing really aggressive though.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 1%, this is sort of dry and flat.  That butryic note is still present, but pretty manageable as a tartness as opposed to a full blown sour dairy note.\n\nAt 3% I'm picking up some spice and vanilla.  Base has filled in a bit, I'm getting something eggy but still not a ton of richness. Still a bit on the dry side, going toward chalky.  Sour note is fairly aggressive.\n\nJust based on these tests, I'd probably be using this low as an accent flavor.  I'd probably be at around 1.5% to start.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Decent \"clean\" option for a custard flavor, but I still like FA Custard and FLV Custard more due to the less pronounced sour butyric notes.\n\nI don't think you're going to get around the sourness here.  May be more useful in adding a bit of richness to a yogurt or cheesecake flavor than trying to use this as a standalone custard base or \"richness\" kind of additive for a bakery.\n\n**Second Opinions:** [There's a note up on the ELR Page by user \"Silhouette\".  They write: \"Single Flavor tests starting at 2% (Private Recipe). FR flavors are potent, suggested percentages are around 2%. This is simply 'Custard' if you go looking for it at NR, not 'Vanilla Custard'. I can tell this has BA in some amount by taste, I can't tell yet if it going to affect flavor for me yet.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Flavor Revolution Honey, 1,3 and 5%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 14 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  I've never had anything by Flavor Revolution so why not start with a flavor that can turn into a trainwreck pretty quickly?  Feels like a less concentrated version of FA Honey.\n\nThis is a floral honey, rather than the squeeze-bear type.  The floral note here is a bit warm and relatively full, more like wildflower honey than just sweet perfume.  All of the honey flavors have at least some degree of ammonia to them, and on a scale of 1 to litterbox, this is pretty mellow.\n\nBehind that floral note, you do get some actual honey.  Sweet, sticky, and warm... pretty much just honey.  These are suggested at 2%, but this feels like it's taking more flavor to really fill out.  At relatively higher percentages I get some slightly sticky texture and mouthfeel, and a pretty accurate honey sweetness.  At 5% I get a moderate fullness, with just a bit of a raw base taste poking through.  The flavor around it actually feels relatively full, it just has an almost under-flavored aftertaste.  It may well be the flavor of the concentrate instead of a concentration issue, but the thinness on the tail end of the flavor is a bit odd.\n\nThis  actually tastes a good deal like FA Honey, which is also not awful.  Just tasting the two side by side, they have that same not too-perfumey wildflower kind of vibe.  I'd say the FA at 1% actually tastes a bit fuller and sweeter than the Flavor Revolution at 5%.  In general, the Flavor Revolution feels a little thinner and noticeably less concentrated.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Floral, but not off-putting for a honey flavor. Some watery sweetness at the tail end of the flavor.  Maybe just a hint of a brighter green vegetal flavor, but pretty subtle.  Light ammonia.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  At lower percentages this feels a bit dry.  Lighter as the sweetness fills in at relatively higher percentages.  Seems to have a bit of an extra bite, but nothing crazy.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 1%, I'm not getting much out of this beyond sweetness.  Some very light floral notes, and a sort of dry, warm neutral sweetness.  Doesn't remind me much of honey here.\n\nAt 3% floral note tastes a bit like wet flowers.  Not perfumey or incredibly floral.  Fairly sweet and warm, but without much body.  Sweetness still feels a bit thin and watery.  Less dry here.\n\nAt 5% the florals a bit more pronounced but not a deal breaker.  Beginning of the exhale is thicker and a bit warmer, doesn't feel too much sweeter than 3%.  Sweetness is starting to pick up some darker honey as opposed to straight sugar notes.  More recognizably honey here but still a bit thin on the back end.\n\nIncreasing the percentage as a S&V, this doesn't seem to require some crazy huge steep.  The flavor I'm getting as a S&V is maybe a bit sharper and the sweetness feels a bit dry, but it's reasonably close to the steeped version.  Trying this at 7%, there's maybe a bit more ammonia, but it's nothing too crazy. Mouthfeel is a bit thicker and warmer.  Sweetness still feels a bit watery and thin on the end.  9% is probably too floral.\n\nJust based on these tests, I'd be around 4% and using this an accent.  The flavor does get sweeter and the floral notes aren't overwhelming at higher percentages, but it doesn't really fill in the back of the flavor by just increasing the percentage.  Pretty generically sweet at low percentages, decent sweetener for floral or light mixes at 2%.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Not sure if there are specific applications that wouldn't be better served by using less FA.  Taste is very close, and I dig the fuller sweetness of the FA.\n\nIf you do have this, the floral edge is going to make this hard to work into bakeries, but it should work well with tobaccos.\n\nWorkable with creams or yogurts at relatively lower percentages before those florals really show up.\n\nFW Butterscotch Ripple or natural butterscotch would fill in the back end of this and give it something closer to a squeeze-bear blandness.\n\nShould pair well with fruits in general.\n\n**Second Opinions:** Nah.\n\nAFAIK, these are only available through Nicotine River.

The honeydew I can taste at lower percentages is on the candied side, with a heavy, flat sweetness.  There is a bit of a creaminess to it, with almost a vanilla edge.  It has a fuller saturated middle without a really fuller, heavier base.  Nothing that really comes across as juicy or realistic.\n\nThere's a really heavy grassy top note here that doesn't really gel entirely with that flatter sweeter base.  Instead of tasting like a realistic honeydew top note, it more just goes candy honeydew and then grass with nothing really bridging the two.  That grassy note gets chemical and bitter really quickly.\n\nThis overall comes across as a bit dry.  There's a candy sweetness, but it's not overwhelming at the sub 1% where the grassy notes aren't as big of an issue.  Its a thinner flavor, without a base.  The honeydew in here tails off substantially on the exhale, but that grassiness sticks around.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Heavy, bitter grassy note that gets chemical.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Fairly light at the lower percentages required to duck most of those grassy notes, but it's pretty harsh at 1% or above.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  1% here is actually coming on pretty strong.  There is some bright candied and slightly creamy honeydew flavor, but it's pretty buried by a bitter and chemical tasting grassy flavor.  Top heavy, with no real base to it.\n\n3% is more worse.  Intense bitter grassy notes, but that sweetness is starting to kick in harder.  Strange.\n\n5% is sweet grass and dish soap.  Don't vape this at 5%.\n\nThis seems substantially stronger than at least the Flavor Revolution Raspberry, Pineapple, and Honey.  That honeydew shows up quickly and manages to be pretty blown out by 1%, although it still doesn't have much of a thicker juicier base.  Just as a S&V at .25% using some of the steeped base from the other samples,  It does cut down on the grassy notes, but the flavor feels even pretty thin and insubstantial.  .5% has a noticeably stronger grassy note that's coming in quicker than the honeydew flavor.  Just based on these tests, I'd go low with this one as an accent.  I'd probably be at .2-.3% with it.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I'm still woefully behind on my honeydew testing, so I don't have much useful info to compare, but this soapier than TPA Honeydew, and much grassier than the CAP version.  It's less full than either.\n\nI didn't find much of a thicker, fuller flavor to this before it was just blown out by that grassy flavor.  I'd use it as a honeydew accent in melon or just general fruit mixes at the aforementioned low percentage of .2-.3%.  I'm not sure you'll get a full honeydew out of it, but at least it's concentrated?\n\n**Second Opinions:** Nah, not really.\n\nAFAIK, these are only available through Nicotine River.

Texture is a bit dry to come across as accurately pulpy or juicy, but the actual flavor is pretty close to a ripe mango without any funkier overripe notes.  Sweetness is, again, pretty accurate.  Doesn't taste nearly as candied as the other flavor revolution fruits I've tried so far.\n\nThis does have a bit of a floral edge to it, especially at higher percentages.  Sort of perfumey bitter chemical floral, not something greener or piney like  real mango peel.  It's pretty subtle at lower percentages, but it ramps up quickly.\n\nJust a bit thin, dry, and soft.  Trying to crank up the flavoring gets floral and dry without really making the flavor feel fuller or more saturated. Flavor is relatively saturated on the inhale but fades out pretty quickly and gets thin by the end of the exhale.  Not too much in the way of a heavy, fuller base.\n\nComparing it to some of the mango flavors I've tried, seems the closest to TPA Philippine Mango, but maybe a bit more potent and less artificial.  Also has some of the same issues with fullness.  None of the heavy overripe notes of CAP Sweet Mango, but also a bit behind on a deeper, juicy body.  Less floral than FA Mango but almost a similar kind of dryness.  Not nearly as heavy and pulpy as FLV Mango.\n\n**Off-flavors:** A bit on the floral side.  Slightly bitter chemical taste to the floral top notes, especially at higher percentages.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light at workable percentages.  Gets harsh when it turns floral.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  This works fairly well at 1% for a softer mango flavor.  Realistic ripe mango, but it doesn't have a ton of vibrancy or fleshiness to it.  Sweetness level seems pretty on-point for a realistic mango.  Tail of exhale especially feels relatively thin.\n\nThis is substantially more floral at 3% and it's getting a bit dry.  Mango seems a bit brighter, but it's getting bitter and chemical.  Exhale is still pretty thin.\n\nAt 5%, this is heavily dry and floral without too much more actual mango flavor.\n\nJust based on these tests, I'd say the suggested 2% isn't far off.  Doesn't have the body for a primary flavor, but should work well between 1-2% as a realistic mango accent.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I\"d use this mostly to fill out flatter tropical flavors.  If you want to go full mango, this works pretty well to add a bit more dimension and pop to FLV Mango.  Should pair well with a heavier pineapple like CAP Golden Pineapple, one of the banana creams, or FLV Guanabana.\n\nOutside of tropicals, I'd be sticking with fuller, juicier fruits as this might dry out or add some floral notes with another drier, top heavy fruit.\n\nGood choice for subtle mango in creams, but it's a bit dry and thin for bakeries at least solo.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  Still fairly new.\n\n[One note on the ELR page.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/197392)  User \"juice junkie\" writes: \"Mixed at 2% and steeped a month.

It's more of a bright, acidic fresh pineapple than the heavier canned pineapple of something like CAP Golden Pineapple.  There's a nice, bright tartness to this that captures the fresher parts of a pineapple pretty well. There's a bit of a floral edge in the top notes though, and it ends up tasting a bit chemical next to that brighter pineapple.\n\nThe actual body of the flavor does taste a bit artificial, but it's not quite the thick white gummy bear kind of candy pineapple, at least solo.  It's tarter and sweet, but the lack of body almost makes it feel like the candy pineapple they use in a lot of Mexican drinks and candies.\n\nThe mouthfeel here is thinner and dry.  While you get some pineapple juice kind of flavor, the texture is much drier than that.  The finish here, like the grand total of the other 2 FR flavors I've tasted so far, is fairly light. With the floral, artificial edge gets almost a bit astringent.  Sweetness level is pretty dead on for an artificial pineapple but it feels a little chalky from the dryness of the flavor.\n\nComparing this to some of the other available pineapples, this feels like it's somewhere between TPA and INW.  There's quite a bit of that candy tartness like the TPA, and some of that pineapple juice body to it like INW.  Substantially less concentrated than the TPA version, although it's probably just a bit weaker than INW at the same percentage.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  A bit chemical and floral.  Not wildly out of line for thinner pineapple flavors, but it's an issue.  These brighter pineapple flavors also have a bit of a sulfur-y garlic off-note, although it's really subtle and shouldn't really call attention to itself mixed.  I'd call it less prominent than INW Pineapple.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Moderate.  This feels less harsh than something like TPA Pineapple, but it does still have a bit of a bit to it.  The dryness doesn't help.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 1%, I'm not getting much out this.  There's a light, soft pineapple on the inhale, and the exhale feels pretty dead. Light sweetness, tastes fairly realistic if incredibly soft.\n\nAt 3%, this isn't a whole lot more vibrant.  Maybe a bit more saturated, but still pretty soft.  A bit sweeter, and turning over to more of an artificial pineapple.  Starting to get fairly dry for me.\n\nI'm honestly not getting much in the way of additional flavor at 5%.  Still feels soft, but those artificial floralish notes are kicking up and the sweetness is higher but it still feels thin.\n\nI was a little stumped, so I ended up mixing this at 8% and 12%.  It only has 2 days worth of steep on it, but it doesn't really seem to help the situation.  Just dryer, more artificial, and slightly sweeter.  Just based on these tests, I'd probably give up after 4% with this flavor, higher concentrations don't seem to help.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I'm not sure if there are any applications that this is going to be your preferred pineapple.  It doesn't really have much vibrancy or punch to it, and the flavor profile is available from fuller pineapples.\n\nWith that said, I'd use it like a weaker version of INW Pineapple... which is a bit scary.  It's probably best for light pineapple top notes, leaving the actual body of the flavor to other concentrates.  Should blend well with mangos, or a deeper pineapple like CAP Golden Pineapple.  Really, it should blend fairly well with just about any fruit you throw at it, although I'd watch for stuff that was already dry or floral.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  [One note on ELR, substantially more positive than my experience.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/204209)  User \"juice junkie\" writes: \"Mixed at 2% and steeped a month.

The description calls out floral notes, but they aren't too overwhelming or perfumey. More of a light floral accent that stays pretty manageable even at higher percentages.\n\nAt low percentages, it's a softer raspberry without much depth, but it tastes quite a bit like a ripe raspberry if you can past the sweetness.  Cranking up the percentage starts to really bring the candy out, and it picks up a more aggressively sweet, bright candy edge.  At those higher percentages it reminds me of a gummy raspberry flavor with a minimal amount of that gummy texture.  It's bright, and a little sharp.  Doesn't have the warmer, juicier hard candy notes from FA or INW Raspberry.\n\nThere's a pretty intense tartness here, burnishes some of the authenticity at lower percentages, and starts to feel like the base of a sour raspberry type candy at higher percentages.\n\nThis is a bit dry and top heavy.  I'd call it relatively full in the middle and up top, but it doesn't have much in the way of a deeper, juicy base.  The finish on the flavor is a bit thin.\n\nSweetness really ramps up quickly and gets fairly dry.  At lower percentages it's sweeter than an actual raspberry but the flavor feels fairly true.  At higher percentages it's a pretty solidly candy-sweet raspberry.  Starts to pick up a heavy cotton-candy type of dryness.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Nothing completely out of line for a raspberry.  Finish is thin, starts to get dry and harsh up high.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Light low, although still a bit harsh and dry.  Harshness picks up quite up quite a bit up higher as the flavor dries out more.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 1% the actual raspberry tastes fairly close to realistic, but that sour candy baggage is starting to creep in.  Light floral notes, fairly aggressive tartness, and a softer actual raspberry.  Not much body, but some light dryness. Still fairly sweet here.\n\nAt 3% this is starting to get pretty heavily sweet and tart.  Raspberry is a bit deeper but still is struggling a bit in the base. Getting dry.\n\nAt 5% this is bright, sharp, and dry.  Very sweet and tart.  Nothing overwhelmingly floral or off, just a bit too intense.\n\nJust based on these tests, I'd be using this at around 2-3%.  It's pretty sharp and intense, but the base needs some fullness so I wouldn't use it as a solo flavor.  Would work lower at 1% as a tart raspberry accent.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  The thinner base or finish on this could work well for layering.  Still realistic enough to work as a raspberry syrup or topping in bakeries.  Creams should also help smooth this out quite a bit.\n\nFine mixed with juicier fruits.  I'd avoid anything too floral or too dry, so be careful with additional berries.  Nice \"bright\" fruit for pairing against something syrupy and dark.\n\nHas the sweetness to pull of a candy raspberry with one of the candy texturizers to fill in the base.  Dry, bright, sweetness is going to work really well with bubble gum bases, or something pixie stix-ish with FLV Candy Roll or TPA Sweet and Tart.\n\n**Second Opinions:** Nah.\n\nAFAIK, these are only available through Nicotine River.

These are apparently DAAP free, so it may be a function of the steep, but I'm not getting any sour or butryic type notes.  Some slightly funkier cream notes with a very light tartness, but they lean toward realism for a heavy cream as opposed to the anything vomity.  I will say, this seems like the most realistic of the creams I've tryed from Flavor Revolution so far.\n\nStill some vanilla in this one, coming in on the tail end of the exhale.  It's less pronounced than their cream and vanilla cream, playing more of an accent to those richer cream notes instead of being right up front.  Still not a deep, spicy vanilla, but maybe a moderately rich vanilla like you'd get in a cheaper vanilla pudding or custard. Still has some of that bright frosting type vanilla but he richer notes help to keep it from tasting like marshmallows.\n\nTexture is less fluffy and wispy than their Vanilla Cream, but still feels a bit more like a whipped cream rather than a flatter heavy cream flavor.  Full mouthfeel with a moderate density and just a little bit of dryness.  Pretty heavily sweetened, and with that fluffier texture and richer dairy notes reminds me more of a homemade whipped cream as opposed to the Kool Whip kind of vibe from their vanilla cream.\n\nComparing this to some of the other sweet cream flavors, I think is more in the more \"whipped cream\" realm of FW Sweet Cream as opposed to CAP or TPA sweet cream which are definitely heavier on the dairy notes.  Seems fairly similar to FW Sweet Cream, but not quite as rich.\n\n**Off-Flavors:**  More of a vanilla whipped cream than straight sweet cream.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Nah, not really.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 1%, this feels maybe a bit watery?  The texture is probably closer to a non-whipped sweet cream but the flavor is a bit weak and doesn't really feel saturated.  I think I'm still tasting some my base through this.  Vanilla doesn't stand out too much against some of the richer cream notes.\n\nAt 3% this fills more filled in.  Fairly sweet, with some buttery richness.  Texture gets just a hair dry, and it's definitely leaning towards whipped cream. Vanilla also seems pretty prominent here.\n\nJust based on these tests, I'd probably be around the suggested percentage of 2% with this as an accent flavor or cream base.  I feel like it's a bit bland under that, and taking it higher reinforces the whipped cream aspects.  If you were going to use it as a whipped cream, I'd step up to 3%.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This is pretty close in profile to both FW Sweet Cream and CAP Vanilla Whipped cream and could be used a slightly less rich sub.\n\nThis has enough body to stand up some of the more intense bakery flavors as a whipped cream layer.  Should work okay with the yellow or chocolate cakes.\n\nAnd again, good pairing with brighter fruits like strawberries, but could probably stand up to some heavier, darker berry flavors.\n\n**Second Opinions:** [There is a note up for this one on ELR.  User \"juice junkie\" writes: \"Mixed at 2% steeped a month. Using an entheon 0.3 ohms 35 watts.  This flavor reminds me of fresh cream more than a sweet cream. I do get a little bit of the sweet cream notes or bitterness that most sweet creams have. This is a decent flavor at 2%. It has really nice mouthfeel and thickness. I can imagine that if you go higher on this the bitterness of sweet cream would come through a little more.\"](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/197672)\n\n[Here is the product page from Nicotine River.

So here's some speed dating notes on [Flavor Revolution's tobacco flavors:](https://www.nicotineriver.com/collections/flavor-revolution-concentrates/tobacco?sort_by=title-ascending)\n\nAll tested around 50-60 watts in a Mutation X v2. Mixed @ 2% 60/40. Tasted fresh, then 2 weeks steeped. \n\n**Leafy Tobacco** - bright and leafy. Maybe a bit of a citrus note. Pretty strong at 2%. Sweeter type of tobacco. Decent. Surprisingly decent actually. 2 weeks: the citrus note has calmed down quite a bit, and there might be a hint of some kind of under ripe fruit. Maybe imagine taking the skin off of a purple grape and just eating that. Definitely has a leafy Tobacco taste to it, but their Tobacco Morning is probably a bit more leafy. These all seem to have a similar sweet type of \"tobacco\" base. Not a bad thing if you're after some sweet tobaccos. \n\n**Sweet tobacco** - very similar to Leafy. Probably too similar really. I actually don't taste a difference. 2 weeks: about the same, but a bit more dry, and actually a bit less sweet than the Leafy Tobacco. \n\n**Tobacco Morning** - tastes a bit like the other two, but has a bit more tobacco taste. A pretty authentic tobacco taste too. Almost like a TA. 2 weeks: sweet tobacco leaf taste. Bites the tongue quite nicely. Still has that TA taste to it. Maybe like a Flue Cured Absolute. I definitely think this is usable. \n\n**Woody tobacco** - not an oak tobacco. More  like pine? I don't know. Getting a bit of gin feeling from it. Not bad I suppose. 2 weeks: the gin vibes are gone, but it's not left with much that I'd call \"woodsy.\" Not as earthy as I like, and was hoping it would be. \n\nOverall, if you're in to tobaccos and you're shopping at Nicotine River, maybe throw one in the cart. I'd suggest Tobacco Morning, and I'd probably test it closer to 1%. 2% for these was a bit strong. According to the SDS on them, they are flammable, so will have to ship FedEX, so keep that in mind if you weren't planning on shooting for the free shipping for orders over $50. \n\nI haven't used any of them in a mix yet, but I'll probably try out Tobacco Morning first. Not quite sure what I'll be aiming for with it just yet. Probably add something a bit more bitter to try to combat the sweetness of it. If anything works out, you'll probably see it in the October recipe thread. \n\nAnyone else try any of these yet? ",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Flavor Revolution Vanilla Cream, 1% and 3%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 33 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Light, fluffy vanilla whipped cream.  Does most of the things that [FR Cream is trying to do](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/7wkal0/flavor_revolution_cream/), but a bit more successful at it.\n\nAgain, more vanilla than cream here.  Where the vanilla from their normal cream seemed a bit bitter and dry, the vanilla here is a bit fuller without necessarily being all that much more aggressive.  Pretty mellow, lighter vanilla.  Nothing dark, robust or spicy, but a softer frosting type vanilla.  Kind of struggling to find anything really \"creamy\" here.  Very light richness, but nothing that tastes all the much like a cream.  Definitely nothing funky or buytric.\n\nTexture is light and fluffy, without some of the more pronounced dryness from the normal FR Cream. Pretty insubstantial, but in a good way.  Full but light mouthfeel, with no weirder dead spots.  Slightly rich base, slightly dry middle, and a fairly vibrant top end with all the vanilla.  Feels very much like an extremely light whipped cream.  Feels fairly sweet with as light of a mouthfeel as it has. Keeps from going cloying mostly from that lightness. \n\nComparing this to some of the other available whipped creams, this seems maybe a bit lighter and more delicate.  If CAP Vanilla Whipped Cream and FW Sweet Cream both have that richer, fattier base like a whipped cream, this can feel a bit more like Kool-Whip (or your whipped non-dairy topping of choice.)  Same basic effect but not as robust.\n\n**Off-Flavors:**  Nah, not really.  Fluffier, lighter texture if you were expecting a thicker, richer cream.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  I'm not getting much of a hit.  Maybe some slight dryness, but pretty minor.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 1%, this doesn't really stand out to me.  Lighter, wispy vanilla with a pretty neutral body.\n\nAt 3%, some of the richness starts to show up.  Vanilla is solid but not overbearing. Fluffy texture, with just a light hint of dryness.\n\nJust based on these tests, I'd probably be a bit higher than the suggested 2% on this one.  I'd be using this around 3-4% as a whipped cream layer or accent for stronger, dryer flavors.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I'd use this for the light whipped cream instead of trying to make it richer.  Good with brighter fruits like strawberries as a whipped cream layer.\n\nWould also pair well with lighter cake bases like FW White Cake or WF Princess Cake.\n\nIn the comments for FR Cream, patg55 talked about pairing FR Cream with FLV Cream to tag some more flavor onto that thicker body and bending FLV Frosting to lighten it up a bit.  While FR Cream wouldn't be my choice for that, I think this concentrate would do a great job of that.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  Can't really find any other notes on this.\n\n[Here's the product page from Nicotine River.

Feels a bit bright for a custard, lacking some of the darker spicier notes from a vanilla bean type flavor.  Vanilla here is kind of a bully, pushing around the lighter custard notes. I do get just a bit of eggyness but not much buttery richness.  Butryic kind of milky taste hiding in the background.\n\n[Flavor Revolution's straight Custard](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/7xcujp/flavor_revolution_custard/) is pretty much swamped by an abundance of butyric acid.  It doesn't seem as severe here due to the really prominent vanilla, but this has some of the same kind of sourness going on.  Again, with a month-long steep most of the more aggressive, vomity parts have pretty much steeped out, but there is still a tart sourness to the base of this.  I get the sourness the most on the inhale, the ehxale is heavy on vanilla that it covers up the worst of it.  The vanilla here covers a lot of sins, and in general this is much more pleasant to vape than the straight custard.\n\nThicker mouthfeel without too much buttery richness.  With the sour, milky notes feels more like a pudding mouthfeel rather than a custard.  That vanilla gets a bit dry for me with extended vaping.  There's a heavy sweetness to this, along with all that vanilla.\n\n**Off-Flavors:**  Sour tart note, feels like a milk base instead of a cream.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Nah, not really.  Some slight dryness to the vanilla, but nothing major.\n\n**Percentage testing:** At 1%, this mostly feels like a strong vanilla with a little bit of a tangy dairy.  Not much richness or depth but nothing too sour.\n\nAt 3% the vanilla here is pretty intense. Strong vanilla, and that tanginess feels a bit sour.

Probably the best \ncompromise on flavor and sourness.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Decent option for a relatively rich vanilla pudding base with a lengthy steep, especially if you've got a more realistic fruit in there to soak up some that tartness.\n\nMore vanilla forward DAAP free custard option than normal FA Custard.\n\nShould work pretty well with a yogurt base and some cooling to make a frozen yogurt.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  I'm not finding a lot of documentation out there.\n\n[Here's the product page from Nicotine River.

The tobacco note is most prominent on the front of the exhale. It’s a bright, sweeter tobacco sort of similar to something like FLV Cured. The wood takes over about halfway through the exhale, and carries on until the end. Exactly what kind of wood is a bit hard for me to place. There might be a bit of oak in there, but what I’m getting most is something else. I want to say maybe a smoky cedar? When nobody was looking at work I sniffed some cedar shims, and I’d probably say that’s closest. It’s got a moderately dense mouth feel that rolls over the tongue nicely, and gives a hint of a bite on the back end. The smoky element here is most likely [guaiacol,](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guaiacol) which I’ve been able to pick out pretty easily after buying some and testing on its own. \n\n**Off flavors** Nothing really jumping out at me. Everything that is there, I’d expect to be there in something called Woody Tobacco. \n\n**Pairings** I think this would work pretty well with some darker tobaccos, but just keep in mind that the tobacco note that is in there is pretty sweet. So if you’re wanting to avoid that sweetness, maybe grab a different wood additive instead. Or if you were going to do something like FLV Red Burley and Cured, either leave out the Cured or bring it down a bit. \n\nI could see this going quite nicely with a bourbon flavor as well. \n\nButterscotch or caramel might be interesting. A build your own RY4 might get a bit wild with this. \n\nGet weird with some florals? Maybe. Might be cool. \n\n**Percentage** I’ve got this mixed at 2%, which is what the suggested percentage was. It’s a bit strong. If you want a pretty intense wood note, 2% should be plenty. I’d most likely mix with it closer to .5-1% though. \n\n**Notes** I did a [first impressions](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/6zcj0n/flavor_revolution_tobaccos_some_tasting_notes/) write up on the Flavor Revolution tobaccos already, and I really felt compelled to give this one a fair shot. What I ended up finding out is that this one is a steeeeeeper. 2 weeks compared to a month has changed my mind on this one. After I wrote that up, I pretty much left it to be forgotten. While preparing for the tobacco additives show for Noted, I gave it a little drip and thought, “damn, I’m gonna need to revisit this.” So far the others seem to be pretty much the same, but this one surprised me with how much it changed over time. \n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FW Beetle Juice, 3 and 6%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 5 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Another mysterious flavorwest fruit blend, this time made famous by [CaptainCannibal's mythic Shurb Clone.](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/22318#shurb_by_captaincannibal)  If I had to guess at the flavors in here, I'd probably say pineapple, some kind of citrus, and raspberry or cherry... but that's a just a guess. It kind of tastes like a combination of [FW Magma Current](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/60x8bc/fw_magma_current/) and [FW Big Stick](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/6ox840/fw_big_stick/) but somehow measurably better than either.  Thicker mellow base, but most of the brighter fruit flavor seems like it's top notes. Seems like a good candidate to adsorb other bright fruit flavors.  The fruit here tastes artificial, but in a brighter, artificial fruit flavoring way as opposed to a duller candy flavor.  I'd either this relatively low around 2-3% to add some complexity and interest to bright fruit mixes, especially tropical flavors.  I'd start cranking things up to 6-8% for a primary note, either accented by another bright fruit flavor or as a candy base.\n\nInhale is pretty heavily sweet with tart and bright pineapple and citrus top notes. Sweetness builds really quickly.  Some thicker mouthfeel to this as well, but I'm not really picking up a distinct flavor to it, more of a just smooth neutral base. Exhale seems to have a sweet raspberry or other bright red berry up right up front, with that tartness coming back in after.  Some of that white gummy bear pineapple candy flavor, and maybe some sharper lemon or orange citrus top notes. Fruit fades a bit on the middle of the exhale and that thicker neutral base kind of takes over. Seems to need a slightly stronger base flavor, and it feels just a bit hollow after that really intense opening.  I pick up some of that plastic-y cherry off note on the tail end of the exhale, and that lingers for a while. Pretty heavily sweet. SDS has no sugar syrup or anything untoward and I don't really taste sucralose, but the sweetness is definitely reminiscent of it.  That neutral base keeps the entire thing from feeling too one-dimensional, but definitely feels like it's a bit top heavy and the rest of the vape is struggling to catch up to bright, artifical fruit top notes.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Feels like there is a light benzaldehyde cherry / plastic off note in here.  Also doesn't taste much like beetles.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light.  Those fruit top notes have a bit of a bite, but that thicker base smooths things substantially.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  [Maybe just mix up that Shurb Clone?](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/22318#shurb_by_captaincannibal)  That seems flippant, but it basically does a lot of what what would probably work well with this flavor. I think this would go well any fruit that isn't really floral or grassy. I could see this with any of that raspberry, cherry, pineapple, citrus, or mango that's already in there.  That recipe also bolsters the thicker neutral base in here with some added whipped cream and vanilla swirl.\n\nOutside of slavishly riffing on that recipe, this seems like it would be a decent basis for a slush flavor, as well as a good base flavor for some kind of mixed-flavor candy where you're getting a handful of different colors at once.\n\nAlso, I could see vaping this solo.  Maybe a bit \"blah\" in the middle but otherwise pretty solid.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, this varies a bit on percentage.  At 2%, there's a decent amount of sweetness and some generic fruitiness, but it's really non-descript. It's even harder to pick out individual fruit notes this low, and has sort of generic juicy fruit gum kind of vibe. 4% is already a lot clearer.  Most of what I'm getting tastes like candy pineapple, but there's some syrupy red berries in there as well. Very light cherry off-note to it.  At 6%, it's on the sweet and bright side, and there's actually a little bit of definition to that fruit blend. I'm picking up some more clear citrus-y notes here.  It's getting pretty heavily sweet.  The weird cherry twinge to it hasn't really kicked up from the 4% test. At 8% it's pretty heavily sweet, bordering on over the top. The lack of definition on that smooth base is getting a little odd as well. 10% is personally too sweet for me, and 12% is starting to push chemical.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[So I realize I've linked the recipe for the Shurb clone twice already, but the reddit post with the development notes are pretty interesting.

I get a pretty mellow indistinct candy-ish fruit flavor. Lighter, sweet pineapple candy base.  I'd go with the white gummy bear analogy, but it's actually a bit softer than that.

Nothing realistic, which is probably a fit for the profile but it's also not quite as syrupy and bright as I'd like for a proudly artificial fruit flavor.  No cooling that I can detect, so it doesn't really end up feeling like a popsicle flavor.  Between that gnarly cherry and  the lack of brightness and flavor saturation, kind of a tough sell for mixing. If you are going to end up using it, I'd go for maybe 5%.  Those cherry off-notes are pretty offputting as you go higher.\n\nInhale is mostly warm candy pineapple, but a bit soft and indistinct. The pineapple tastes a bit muddy and flat. Almost has a hint of a candy banana to it.  No real tartness that screams pineapple.  You can maybe taste some of that cherry, but it's an accent more than a discrete component. That sweetness builds and the inhale picks up medicinal cherry notes.  Exhale opens with that candy pineapple, and a bit of detectable cherry. Top notes build in the middle of the exhale, bringing in a solid but not completely overwhelming medicinal plastic edge to the entire thing. Pineapple flavor seems to soften up quite a bit and get unsatisfying as those cherry off-notes kind of take over. Vape is on the sweet side, but it's a muddy, dull sweetness instead of a bright, syrupy sweetness. Lingering cherry off-notes.  Not particularly harsh, but those cherry top notes are a bit bitter and tough on the throat.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Cherry off-notes. Medicinal and plastic. Stops short of full gasoline, but it's the familiar struggle with cherry flavors.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light? Not really harsh but unpleasant throatiness and a bit of bitterness from those cherry off-notes. \n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  If you can past the cherry off notes, I feel like this needs some cooling and some brightness to really pull off a popsicle. If you don't mind the extra citrus, this could be a job for my only friend INW Lime.  But any kind of syrupy bright fruit would probably work.\n\nOutside of accentuating the profile, not quite sure what to do with this. It may be a decent candidate for turning into a slush or whatever if you don't hate fake cherry flavors.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, this is all about how much of that artificial cherry you can take. At 2%, it's a lighter flavor overall. Feels really undersaturated but the cherry off-notes are fairly subtle. 4% is a bit sweeter, if not really brighter. Cherry off-notes are fairly noticeable but that candy pineapple is okay but muddy. 6% is prety high on those off-notes for me. 8% is getting robotussin-ish, as that fake cherry is getting too aggressive and the off notes are unpleasant.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nBrand New!\n\n[Here is the product page.  It is not useful. Worth noting FW doesn't have a SDS up for this yet, so no firm indication if there is anything weird like sugar syrup in here.  I know FW Boom (their bomb pop flavor) has sugar syrup, and this could conceivably have some in there.  If it does, it doesn't necessarily seem overwhelming or anything... but if you're super cautious about that kind of thing I'd wait until they publish the SDS.](http://flavorwest.com/index.php/big-stick.html)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**\n\n[Bonus video first test for this, FW Sprinkles, and FW Star Candy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvX1V5-8BD0)",

White cake note is fairly mellow. Decent texture but the cake taste seems a bit light. No real rich or eggy notes to it. Frosting has a little wax to it, but seems a bit underdone for a birthday cake, not quite that obnoxious sweetness I want. Pretty heavy artificial taste to it.  Just a theory, but I think they are trying to emulate that weird bitter note from using way too much food coloring or sprinkles... but my palate could just be broken. I'm not 100% sure what constitutes \"a birthday cake\" specifically, but I associate the flavor with FW Cake Batter Dip and this doesn't really have that obnoxious frosting note. I'm not 100% sure on usage for this, it doesn't really scratch my itch for obnoxious birthday cake flavor and I think you could get there using other concentrates. If you are going to use this, about 6% seems to be the sweet spot.\n\nInhale is sweet.  Some frosting here with a lighter vanilla and a pretty artificial edge. Some waxiness to the frosting note. A little light for a cake flavor but not too airy.  Exhale has dry white cake up front. Decent amount of texture without a whole lot of richness. Good separation between frosting and cake notes. That same aggressive artificial top note, getting a little bitter and chemical tasting.  Fairly dry mouthfeel from the cake with and a bit of bitterness from the frosting.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  The \"birthday\" part of this tastes artificial and slightly bitter.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light. Fairly smooth except for that artificial edge.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I'm not sure that I'll be using this.  FW White Cake seems like a better white cake flavor, and the frosting note is pretty weird and doesn't really scratch the birthday cake kind of itch.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, 2% seems too light. Kind of bitter and chemical without much body. 4% is a bit more full, but still doesn't really have a full sweet frosting note. Cake is present and textured without being dry. 6% is fairly dry overall. Frosting note is sweet but that artificial edge is kind of killing it for me. 8% is maybe a bit too dry and it's getting a bit bitter. 10% is too dry overall.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nIt's a new flavor, so not really.\n\n[Here's the product page from Flavorwest.

Tart.    \n**Off-flavors:** Tart rind aftertaste.       \n**Pairings:** Fruits. Candies. Tobaccos. Desserts.    \n**Position In The Recipe:** Top note. It'll cover 1/2 of the flavor up front in just an orange recipe. It's rich. \n**Notes:** To me this is a hybrid of a naval orange and a ruby red grapefruit. It just blossoms with a ton of natural orange upfront. The end note is just like a grapefruit would leave. Bitter. Rind. If you've never had grapefruit, this end note is like biting into the white strings of rind in an orange. The stingy portions in the center of the orange. Or just taking a bit of a nip into the white colored portion of the inner skin of an orange. As off putting as this may sound it's what makes this flavor so unique and part of my ADV. The tart sour notes hit fairly quickly into the middle and with the right amount of sweet added, this sweet and tart dances on your tongue in heavenly unison. It's deep, it's got some dark notes and full bodied. I simply mask the way, way, way at the end bitter note with some:\n\nCap Sweet Tangerine 3% |FW Lemonade 1% (Not totally necessary, bump the Cap ST up 1%) |FW Blood Orange 6%|     \n:--|:--:|--:    \nAlso, if you want a visual on what happens when you don't shake your juice, try this one. It will dye every bottle you mix it in. It leaves a floating deep orange ring at the top which will remind you how much you need to shake all your juices before use.  \n**Throat Hit**It hits the back and upper portion of my throat just like when smoking a cigarette. For some it's intolerable.  For me, it's perfect. It definitely has a strong throat hit.  \n**Rating:** 4.5/5 That's a tough love 4.5. I like this flavor so much and I wanted to give it a 5. However the bitter note on the end may very well ruin this flavor for a lot of people.     ",

    "markdown": "**Setup:** Recoil w/ flavor barrel, Dual 15 wrap 26g 3mm Nifethal 70 coils @.18 ohms.  60w power, 450F temp limit. Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FW Blue Raspberry, 3 and 6%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 10 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Just a disclaimer up front, I'm not here to rehash the great blue raspberry wars.  I came only to try a flavoring.  I liken Blue Raspberry to pornography: I know it when I see/taste it.\n\nFW Blue Raspberry does taste \"bluer\" than the normal FW Raspberry.  It's a little sweeter and fuller with a bit of syrupy, thick edge to it.  It's also tarter overall, dragging it away from a more realistic raspberry flavor.  So it fits the bill in that way, but it's not really a satisfying blue raspberry flavor. It's a little soapy overall, and there is a pretty heavy bitterness on the top end of the flavor.  The bitterness feels like it's maybe an attempt to emulate those heavy candy flavors, but it just doesn't really cohere and ends up tasting strange.  It's another flavor that is a bit hard to find a use for.  It's too candied for a realistic raspberry, and the artificial blue part of this is harsh, bitter and doesn't really endear itself.  If you are using this, it feels like it would benefit from sweetener to counteract a little of that bitterness.  I'd also keep it at 4% or under, the soapiness tends to increase pretty quickly after that.\n\nInhale does have some sweet candy raspberry flavor to it which builds on itself.  It manages to get up to a bit syrupy, and it has a heavier mouthfeel.  There is some tartness in the top notes which seems more accurate to profile, but there's a bitter edge to it all.  It doesn't taste overtly plasticy but it has sort of an undefined chemical edge to it. The combination of that heavy, thick sweetness and that bitter chemical top note ends up tasting soapy overall. Exhale is largely the same as the inhale.  The flavor seems to work best at the beginning of the exhale, where you get more of that sweet raspberry with a tarter accent.  The top notes come in a beat later, and they are all sorts of bitter.  Those bitter top notes dominate the back half of the exhale and manage to linger for a while. Sweetness level is actually pretty good, and the texture is relatively thick and syrupy.  The blue raspberry flavor underneath the bitter weirdness is actually pretty solid, but that chemical taste is all just a a bit much.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  The blue part of this tastes a bit more chemical and bitter than a tarter candy blue raspberry.  It also starts to get soapy around 4%.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Moderately harsh.  Between that bitterness and the normal throat hit it's a bit tough to vape.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This doesn't really scratch that blue raspberry itch for me.  It ends up tasting artificial in a bad way, unlike the artificial in a good way taste you're supposed to get from blue raspberry flavors.  It pulls off the sweetness okay, and it's pleasantly tart, but it's a bitter mess.  My usual fallback is to use something in your coffee, but that probably won't work here.  Maybe learn to make candy?\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, I haven't really found a percentage where this works. At 1% and 2% this feels pretty light overall.  I get a fair bit of that bitter taste, but the actual blue raspberry is pretty faint. At 4% the blue raspberry feels quite a more filled out.  The bitterness is still there, but there is a nice syrupy texture and the tartness seems like it's just prominent enough. At 6%, I'm getting some weird soapy vibe to this, as that chemical edge has picked up some detergent. 8% feels even more bitter, without a comensurate increase in the raspberry underneath. 10% is like a cotton candy soap.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  [Here is the ELR Page.  Pretty thin, but user \"protard\" offers this: \"@6%: Fresh berry drink mix flavor, slight candy. Refreshing aftertaste, a little sour, hangs on the tip of the tongue. Like it!\"  \"Krazy.mixin\" writes: \"Blue Raspberry candy flavor, very sweet on its own so DON'T ADD EXTRA SWEETNER it will mute the flavor more than anything else.\"](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/23040)\n\n[Mostly positive reviews on BCF.  User \"Jay Maher\" writes: \"Love this flavor. So much so that it's starting to creep into all my new recipes. Pairs really well with lemon and moreso with Capella's hibiscus. Stomps all over TPA's blue raspberry which was too alcoholic/medicine-y for me.\"  User \"AJ Fox\" isn't a fan though: \"This has a chemical taste that seems to over power anything resembling anything else other than drinking a random beaker of mystery stuff in the science lab.\"](http://www.bullcityflavors.com/blue-raspberry-fw/)\n\n[ECX is largely positive, but kind of all over the place.  User \"Andrea\" has found a new soul-mate: \"This is by far the best flavor I ever used. I have over 150 flavors and this one is my all time favorite. It tastes clean and bright, no funny tastes. I love it made REALLY sweet with Flavor Wests sweetener. THIS IS GREAT STUFF !!!\"  User \"Max\" is similarly enamoured \"I'm not normally a fan of blue raspberry flavored anything, but this one is awesome! I've noticed it pairs extremely well with Raspberry Sweet by TFA.\"  Some solid dissent on there though, user \"Matthew\" suggests: \"2%-3%. It tends to taste a little plastic-y, but that fades away with a several days of steeping. It's still a decent flavor, and tastes like the name implies.\"  And \"Wood\" one-stars with: \"I think this is an odd, bitter, and more artificial flavor than I was thinking itd be....not that its too sweet candy-like artificial but its like a cheaper brand artificial.\"](http://www.ecigexpress.com/diy-e-liquid/diy-e-liquid-flavors/flavor-west/flavorwest-sweet-flavors/blue-raspeberry-by-flavor-west.html?p=2)\n\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**\n\n[Bonus video first test of FW Grape Soda, Grapeberry Ice, Raspberry, and Blue Raspberry.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzZaNvjo6Bg)",

As for the smell, I get a strong whiff of sweet blueberries with some candy backnotes... actually, it really smells like those AirHead candies I used to devour as a kid. It's definitely reminescent of blue raspberry candy instead of an actual blueberry cotton candy.\n\n**Taste:**\n\nOh wow, first impressions. This is a tasty flavor! The blueberries aren'y exactly 'fresh tasting'. Instead, what I get tastes more like a blueberry extract used in many of my favourite blueberry candies. I don't get much cotton candy to be honest. Maybe just ethyl maltol. \n\nBut this flavoring does show a lot of promise at 5%! \n\nIt's sweet, fun, juvenile and kind of reminds me a little of when I was a kid. My parents would take me to the carnival snack booth and dad would say I could pick one thing. I would always, hands down, go for cotton candy. Even tho the pink ones always tasted like the blue or purple ones (probably just food dye without actually changing the actual flavor LOL!) \n\n**Standalone/Mixer:**\n\nIt's really tasty as a standalone although I would lean on the higher side of things when mixing (try 7 - 10%). As an accent, this works pretty much the same way as TFA Cotton Candy. It definitely sweetens up a mix but it does something extra, an almost underlying candy-like taste. IMO, TFA Cotton Candy just moistens a recipe and gives it the impression of sweetness. FW's version actually has a more genuine candy taste to it.\n\n**Pairings**\n\nFruits, desserts, candies!\n\n**Is it 4oz-worthy?**\n\nA word that comes to mind when vaping this is fun! This is a very simple and comforting flavoring. There's not much complexity to it but rest assured, it'll always leave you vaping with a smile. Because it's such a linear flavour, you definitely need to play around with it and flavor bend in order to alter its properties. Try adding some bubblegum or swedish candy to it to make it a full-fledged candy!\n",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FW Butterbeer, 2 and 4%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 15 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Undercooked sweet bakery dough and cream soda.  Kind of hard to describe, but almost like a much less intense version of FA Joy or a butter rum mix minus the actual rum. Warm, soft dough taste with a slightly liquid texture.  Tastes like there is a bit of yeast-risen vibe to it. Sweetness is pretty non-descript, not really a bakery or frosting sweetness, more like a heavy sweet top note on that bakery-ish base.  I'd primarily use this to punch up sweeter bakeries, especially cinnamon rolls or other breakfast-type pastries at around 4%.\n\nInhale has some warmer bakery taste to it, but not really the grainy texture I'd expect.  Almost like a warm sweet dinner roll, or the middle of an undercooked cinnamon roll minus the cinnamon.  Kind of a generic moderate dense body instead of a fluffy bakery. Building flat sweetness.  Exhale has a stronger bakery taste.  Feels like there is some actual buttery richness in here, with a lighter, warm yeasty note.  Sweetness is a little more defined than on the inhale, and tastes a bit like cream soda.  Not really dense enough for a frosting note.  Texture overall doesn't fit the taste.  That might be where the \"beer\" part of the butterbeer comes in.  It isn't quite solid enough to really taste doughy, more like a sweet bakery dough soda.  Finish is pretty clean overall.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  No idea what butterbeer is supposed to taste like.  A bit odd overall, but nothing offensive.  Mostly a pretty heavy mismatch between the thinner texture of this and the richer bakery notes.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Nah, not really.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I'd use to thicken and sweeten other bakery concentrates.  Seems like it should be pretty spot on with cinnamon rolls.  It has a certain breakfast pastry vibe to it that would also work cereals.  This feels like it has a lot of promise as an additive in general, so I could see this being pretty widely useful working with bakeries.\n\nIf you wanted stick with the idea that this should be some kind of liquid, seems like a good starting point for a hot buttered rum or similar.\n\n**Notes:**  This doesn't really seem to work at 2%.  Light sweet bakery dough accent, but it's a bit dry and underflavored.  4% works substantially better. Bakery note is a bit more solid.  Still not bakery textured, but there is some more warmth, buttery nuance, and richness to it. 6% is still pretty solid.  Heavier bakery but a lighter texture.  Seems to be getting a bit dry again.  8% seems pretty dry and is starting to taste a bit chemical. I'd use this around 4% as a backup note for other bakeries, or maybe 6% if you want to accent around this as a primary note.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nNah, still new.\n\n[Here's the Flavorwest product page.](http://flavorwest.com/index.php/water-soluble-flavoring/butterbeer.html)  SDS sheets are up for their newer flavors, it looks like they just list propylene glycol and benzyl alcohol.

It definitely smells like a candy cherry, and the herb/tobacco notes behind it make it appear vaguely medicinal on the nose. The flavor on the initial vape is a bit more spice or herb heavy than the nose of it. Almost like there’s a clove note behind everything else. I actually rather like this in an odd sort of way. It isn’t particularly good as a stand alone cherry, and I’m not really getting a particularly present tobacco flavor.\n\n**After a week:**      \nThe clove notes are kind of… gone. The inherent bit of tongue numbing sensation that’s associated with clove does continue to exist here. That makes it functionally unusable as a solo cherry, but does remain a candidate for use in a more robust recipe. Sadly, despite sitting on my desk for a week, no tobacco notes have really come to the fore here on their own, which leaves this at the very least mis-named. There is a bit of body here, feeling almost syrupy.\n\n**Off notes:**    \nI don’t know that clove could really be considered an off note for balsam, but it was unexpected in my view. The cherry is not truly authentic, but more like an unsweetened (or at most very lightly sweetened) candy syrup.\n\n**Suggested pairings:**      \nI plan to lean into this to sort of blend the strangest aspect of cherry cheyenne cigars with what might be the most appealing aspect of Djarum’s clove cigarettes for something I could use as a change of pace type recipe. Past that it is sort of herbal and sort of fruity, so it could be useful in an abstract pastry or somewhat “off the rails” mix of fruits and herbal or floral flavors. I can’t imagine this being used as a true focal point in a recipe, but it could be the square peg that can be shaved down to fit through a round hole under the right context, with the caveat that you’ll very likely be working against it as much as you’re working with it.\n\n**[DIY_Ejuice's list of flavor reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Anyhow, onto the important stuff.\n\n**Tested at:**     \n3% Single Flavor, approx 75% VG\n\n**Tested with:**    \nVandy Vape Paradox   \nsingle coil    \n3mm ID 6 wraps   \n4/32g flattened twisted SS316l   \n50watts\n\n**Initial Impression:**     \nThe smell is a dead ringer for a cherry popsicle brand ice pop, or cherry slush puppy syrup. Decidedly artificial, and candylike. At 3% shake and vape it’s not overpowering by any means, a bit weaker than I’d have expected. The flavor does follow the scent pretty accurately, though it sort of lacks body, not quite “wet” enough to make it a candy in and of itself. It’s actually quite reminiscent of a Luden’s cherry cough drop or a cherry lifesaver. I don’t get any strong medicinal or plasticy off notes at this stage, but it also isn’t quite sweet enough to muster a fully formed “candy” note on its own.\n\n**After a week:**      \nThings have become a bit more artificial, and a bit softer.That is allowing a bit of a waxy flavor/mouthfeel to come through. This is a very much still in the flavor profile of a Luden’s cough drop but it might be bordering on cherry wax lips or some form of store brand cherry starburst.\n\n**Off notes:**    \nNot so much “off” notes as it is just too thin to stand up on its own. After a week though, the slightly waxy note that becomes more noticeable is unfortunate.\n\n**Suggested pairings:**      \nThis flavor begs to have something behind it to sell either a syrupy iced drink or a hard candy. I can’t imagine using this with a cream unless you’re aiming for something odd like an alternate universe creme savers candy where they actually made a cherry flavor. I don’t think you could sell this into a black cherry ice cream, at least not without some serious help. Similarly, because this leans so heavily toward a candy flavor I can’t imagine it being particularly valuable for bakery or *most* tobacco applications. Maybe something of a Starbuzz style fanciful flavored shisha tobacco.\n\n**[DIY_Ejuice's list of flavor reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

It's actually a very good coffee, it's by no means a dark roast or espresso but it has got body. I think it's more of a creamy coffee definitely cream in here oh and sugar it's definitelysweet. It's also pretty weak tasting no way is 5% enough as a Standalone bump this up to probably 10% if you want flavour. \n\nSo it's pretty ok coffee good as a Standalone I could easily vape this it's enough flavour to know what it's doing without it getting boring or unpleasant.

Zero effervesence (which I was really hoping for), very slight vanilla maybe, a mild sweet-creaminess. I don't see this flavoring offering anything that other flavors don't already do better.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FW Creamy Chocolate Cake, 2 and 4%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 8 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** It's an attempt at Hostess Ding-Dongs.  Lighter chocolate, more noticeable in the actual room note than the vape. There's a sweeter filling here that seems to be pushing around the chocolate quite a bit. Some wax to this, but not the heavy, waxy chocolate you'd expect from a the chocolate coating on a ding-dong.  Not a ton of grain to the cake base, or at least it's having some issues with texture coming through that filling. Doesn't really come across as a chocolate cake flavor, for me at least, more of just the filling with a bit of cake accent and that light chocolate. I'd probably stay in the 5-7% range for this as a primary flavor with maybe some help in the chocolate department and texture.\n\nInhale is sweet, with that filling note kind of taking over from the chocolate here. The combination of whatever chocolate they're using and that sweeter twinkie-esque filling tastes a little bit fruity to me. Moderately dense, with a little bit of harshness. Seems like a fairly warm vape, and responds well to some extra temperature. Exhale has a chocolate cake but it seems a bit on the subtle side. Nothing that really seems like a chocolate coating. Not sure why exactly, but the chocolate really seems to come and go for me.  Heavily sweet filling note, no heavy vanilla or anything. Fairly close to profile. Texture is okay, letting you get a little bit of that cake graininess along with that sweeter filling. Some waxiness to this, but with the lighter chocolate it feels like it's working more with the filling than a chocolate coating.  This vapor on this smells more like chocolate than it tastes, if that makes any sense. I think the filling is kind of stomping on the chocolate and the combination has a errant bit of fruitiness to it.  Fairly clean finish.\n\nThis is a fairly dark concentrate, but about 15ml in and I haven't been noticing any drastic coil gunk, so this may actually be fructose or whatever free.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  I'm a getting a light fruitiness from the weaker chocolate and the filling. Nothing overwhelming, it just has a touch of like a black cherry or maybe raspberry edge to it.  Also doesn't seem to have a heavy chocolate coating that I'd expect from a ding-dong.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light. Nothing crazy, but it's a bit warm and harsh.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  To use this as a ding-dong, I think this desperately needs a bit more AP.  It should help a bit with a clearer texture on the cake and AP tends to work really well to boost chocolate. I'm partial to FA Cookie in small percentages, but just straight Acetyl Pyrazine would probably work as well.\n\nThat chocolate coating is a little harder. This already has some wax, so you may want to go for a more syrupy chocolate flavor that doesn't bug you and hope it latches onto that wax in the filling.\n\nJust enough chocolate here that this would be pretty distracting in an accent role for anything but a chocolate cake/cupcake type mix. Used at a lower percentage it may bring in some of that filling sweetness to a richer, more robust chocolate cake mix..\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing. at 2% this actually seems to be a bit heavier on the chocolate, or at least the filling isn't getting in the way. Feels a bit thin though, and it's fairly dry. 4% has a more solid filling note, starting to step on the chocolate. Lightly fruity, but the actual texture and body is pretty good. 6% has a more solid filling note than chocolate cake, at least solo. 8% is a bit too sweet, waxy and warm.  Getting really muddy and sweet up that high.  I'd use this between 5-7% as a primary note, or maybe 3% as an accent.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nNah, still new.\n\n[Here's the Flavorwest product page.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FW Creamy Sponge Cake, 2 and 4%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 9 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** It's a twinkie flavor, at least according to the picture FW put up with it. Seems to be heavier on the filling than the sponge cake.  That filling tastes pretty authentically artificial.  Lighter, bright artificial vanilla cream flavor. I'm not getting that much on the sponge cake, but what I can taste is okay if a bit dry. It has some richness, but that could just be the vanilla filling bleeding into the cake. Maybe a tiny bit of drier artificial butter flavor in there.  Fairly waxy mouthfeel. Sweetness level seems pretty dead on for twinkie filling.  Gets a bit muddy towards the end, with maybe a bit of anise-y bitterness to that artificial vanilla, but I get that with most cake concentrates. I'd use this for the filling and build around it with other bakeries, somewhere around 4%.\n\nInhale is sweet and fairly fluffy. I'm not getting a ton of flavor to it beyond that light artificial vanilla twinkie filling.  If you told me there was a hint of banana in here I'd believe you, but I feel that way about actual twinkies.  Drier texture, not too much sponge cake grain taste, but it hits the texture. Exhale brings in some light sponge cakes notes with maybe a bit of movie-theater style butter.  Solid, drier, slightly grainy texture. Vanilla cream filling dominates again on the ehxale.  Waxy, dry mouthfeel with a twinkie-accurate level of sweetness. Lingering waxiness and sugar lips, with some of that artificial edge getting a bit bitter.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  This has a slightly bitter artificial edge to it overall, but it feels fairly authentic to the profile. I also get some of the muddiness from yellow-ish cakes, but it's not as pronounced as something like CAP Yellow Cake.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light, mostly from the dryness.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I'd use this mostly for the filling.  I think the sponge cake part of this is subtle enough you could drag it in a different direction by pairing with another bakery. Definitely feels closer to an artificial pastry cream as opposed to a bavarian cream or something custard-ish, but I could see it in more commercially sweet versions of filled donuts or cannolis.  I also think it would work with some good old fashioned FW Yellow/Cancer Cake to get closer to a more balanced twinkie, maybe with a bit of INW Creme Brulee to mimic the more cooked part of sponge cake.\n\nAlso seems like a good fit for the cream filling inside something like a swiss or strawberry shortcake roll.  Basically all of your obnoxious commerical pastries.\n\n**Notes:**  Another flavor that seems mostly limited by the dryness. 2% feels like almost all filling. The bitterness on that artificial edge stands out a bit more for me down low, but it's still plenty sweet and present. 4% has a small but noticeable amount of sponge cake taste to it. Filling seems slightly fuller and that bitter edge doesn't stick out as much to me. 6% feels pretty dry overall.  Filling note is still okay, but that sponge cake feels too dry and I'm getting more of that weird muddiness at the end. 8% feels pretty dry and that artificial edge is a but much.  I'd use this at around 4%.\n\nReal Flavors has a deep fried spongecake super concentrate, but I'd take this one. Some people swear by the RF SC bakeries but they all feel underflavored to me and whatever base they are using doesn't work for me. Based on other peoples reviews, that might be a better route to take but this works better for me.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nNah, still new.\n\n[Here's the Flavorwest product page.

As for the smell, I get a faint whiff of peppermint (because creme de menthe is typically derived from peppermint or corsican leaves). Not much else to say about it, I reckon.\n\n**Taste:**\n\nTastes just like peppermint! There's a mild creaminess in the background, it's also a touch sweet. I don't get much or any boozy or alcoholic taste to it (creme de menthe is supposed to be a mint-flavored alcoholic beverage).\n\nThe mint is also very, very mild. I prefer my mints on the stronger side, to the point where it chills the back of my throat (INW Eucalyptus, <3). This one does not accomplish that. It's more on the lighter side.\n\n**Standalone/Mixer:**\n\nI believe this is more of an accent than a standalone. Wayne from DIYORDIE used it in Cuprian to great effect at 2%. Personally I would use it a lot higher.

    "markdown": "**FLAVOR WEST DOUBLE DUTCH CHOCOLATE**\n\nHello everyone, it's time for another flavor review. My paycheck finally came in the other day and I did what any reasonable man would do, I spend it on a shit ton of different flavorings. One of those flavorings was FW Double Dutch Chocolate. Here is the review. Oh, also, I would like to mention that I will be trying out some new things with the \"review template\". Chrisdvr did an awesome job at spearheading this and setting a ubiquitous style which everyone has used. However, I feel like it's lacking in certain areas. So again, without further ado, here is the review.\n\n**My build:**\n\nKayfun 5 with Therion 75w, Vaped at 30 watts on a single coil build.\n\n**Percentage Mixed**\n\nMixed standalone at 5%\n\n**Steep Time:**\n\n4 days. This one does not need a long steep for the chocolate to come out.\n\n**First impressions:**\n\nNow most people will not find this surprising but I think it's still worth a mention. This flavoring is BLACK, like tar black. It is most definitely without a doubt a coil killer. I'm sure you'll find that a lot of chocolates are plagued with this malady. \n\nUpon taking a quick sniff, I pick up notes of rich cocoa. There's an apparent dark chocolate note to it with a soft undertone of what I assume can only be cream. \n\nSo we've established that it looks like chocolate and smells like chocolate, how does it vape?\n\n**Taste:**\n\nI took one puff. I took two more puffs. Before I knew it, I couldn't put my atomiser down. This flavoring is incredible! It's tasty, full-bodied, borderline-malty and it perfectly represents what a good chocolate should be!\n\nIt's slightly bitter and sweet, like dark chocolate. I also pick up a faint backnote of cream. I don't think I've ever had Dutch Chocolate so I can't draw an accurate comparison. With that said, I can definitely claim with the utmost confidence that Flavor West hit this one out of the park.\n\nThere's none of that fake Tootsie roll chocolate like TFA Double Chocolate Clear. Instead, you'll find a rich, comforting chocolate, like a cup of hot cocoa your mum would make for you when it's raining heavily outside. \n\n**Standalone/Mixer:**\n\nThis definitely works as both! It would be a great standalone because of how nuanced it is. You get some cream, you get that tinge of bitterness, a little maltiness and of course, sweetness! But it never goes into cloying territory, I would say it has high ADV potential!\n\n**Is this 4oz worthy?**\n\nYup! My only regret is not picking up a bigger bottle of this (I only got a vial). This flavoring works as a good base for many chocolate type recipes. It can also work as an accent to give other flavorings a touch of dark complexity. YMMV.\n\nEdit: Someone requested that I vape more of it to see what effects it would have on the coil. So I vaped like 4.5mls of it in my Kayfun. The coils are SLIGHTLY charred but surprisingly, it still chugs fine. No burned taste of any kind. However one thing to notice is the cotton. Black as tar!\n",

    "markdown": "**Setup:** Recoil RDA. Dual kanthal clapton coils @ 0.339 ohm. 55w power, Cotton Bacon wicks. \n\n**Testing:** FW Dulce de Leche @ 2%, 4%, and 6% 70/30 VG/PG, Steeped 6 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Milky cream taste without milky cream texture or much thickness, accented with a touch of caramel at lower concentrations that grows into a dry, cocoa-esque thing at higher concentrations. Testing this next to a jar of actual Argentinian Dulce de Leche (DDL) courtesy of ATF user NaCHeF, this is not DDL. Actual DDL is thick, sticky, and super sweet. It's very close the caramel fruit dip sold next to apples at the grocery store. This is pretty much none of that. \n\n**Off-flavors:** It's called DDL and it's not DDL, so... the whole thing? It gets extra milky caramel like DDL but it's not sticky or sweet, just a disembodied milky sweet cream flavor with caramel notes. \n\n**Throat Hit:** Not really, but at 6% it's a dry and that dryness makes it a little scratchy with prolonged vaping. \n\n**Notes:** 2% you get just a weak hint of milky caramel but no creamy mouthfeel or body, and nothing approaching the sweetness of actual DDL, or even the sweetness of FW Sweet Cream, for that matter. It acts like it might kinda develop into a DDL at a higher concentration, but that's a lie. 4% is a fuller version of the essentially same flavor, with the caramel starting to take on a slightly sharper edge. At 6%, the absence of a creamy mouthfeel becomes much more noticeable. It's still primarily a milky and not very sweet caramel flavor but it's bit dried out, and there's just a little of that distracting cocoa note similar to the one that's very prominent in TFA's DDL.      \n\n**Uses & Pairings:** I'm probably not going to use this flavor at all, honestly. But if I had use it for something, I might try using it as a bridge between cream and a caramel, if I wanted those two blended into something like a caramel milk or caramel ice cream instead of caramel on top of ice cream. Don't know how well that will work, but it's worth a shot, though one of the other known emulsifying flavors would probably work just as well if not better. It's not caramelly enough to serve as a primary caramel flavor (an accurate DDL would be). And it's certainly not creamy enough to stand in for a heavy cream, but it has a milky flavor that I can't imagine wanting in too many other places. Might have some cereal with milk applications, as long as you don't ask it to be to be the only milk or even the main milk.  \n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nELR notes (to date, 33 ratings, 3.5 stars):\n\nA Kopel of users say their preferred single flavor mix is 7.0%, and there's the obligatory 10% in there as well.  \n\nTheFlavorSeeker loves this flavor and describes it as \"like (thick) milk cream sweetened with a hint of honey\" and uses it at 3% \"as a cream base for fruit mixes\" in place of \"classic plain creams or the vanilla based ones.\" \n\nMofogger writes, \"Solo tested @ 7% (6wk cure) If you took FA Condensed Milk (which tastes like chalky, sun-dried dog shit)..and added cardboard with sugar.... You'd get this... Nasty....\"\n\nHollywood VApes says, \"Its not bad, it has a bit of a twang to it that may fade over steep but I prefer Jungle Flavors over this. Pairs well with milks/creams, berries, bakery flavors and one of my favs is butterscotch(FW nat. is my preferred)\" \n \nThree reviews on [Bull City Flavors](http://www.bullcityflavors.com/dulce-de-leche-fw), link provided to prevent the mobile user's thumbnail for this post being a large portion of my large bald dome. \n\n\"This is a 'go to' for me.

First thing that comes to mind is rind but also sweet.. Naval orange seems to be the flavor this is trying to mimic. But its like taking a bite of a naval orange, unpeeled without getting that cottonmouth feeling.. Which Imo isn't that bad. I enjoy it. \n\nGoing to drop it down to 8% see if the rind-y-ness goes away. \n\nRegardless tho this is a decent stand alone and would be great in citrus mixes and beverages as well.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FW Funnel Cake, 2 and 4%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 10 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  [French Toast Crunch.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Toast_Crunch)  Nothing offense here, but it doesn't really remind me of funnel cake.  No fried note here, a cereal grain instead of a bread or dough, and a more syrupy sweetness than powdered sugar. Sweetness seems to have a light maple twinge to it. Maybe just a hint of cinnamon and vanilla in here, but pretty mellow on any kind of spice notes overall.  It's a fairly light and subtle flavor overall, I'd use this a primary note for that glazed cereal thing and accent it to really make it punch a bit harder. Seems to work best around 5-6%.\n\nInhale is sweet but kind of muddy. Sweetness seems to have a light maple to it. Less pronounced than the maple in TFA Bavarian Cream, but that same kind of taste.  Seems like a syrup or glaze more than a powdered sugar.  No real grain on the inhale, but a medium body.  Exhale has some cereal grain to it. Not really a crisp grain texture, but more like the smelling a bowl of freshly poured cereal. Tastes like there is some sweeter, flatter corn cereal in there.  Maybe a hint of vanilla and really light bakery cinnamon. Sweet sugar glaze, with that light maple in the top notes. Clean finish overall with some sugar lips, but this doesn't really do anything close to a funnel cake for me.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Doesn't fit the profile at all, at least for me.  The body here isn't aggressively flavored and has a lighter warm malt / corn note to it that can come across like those edible conrnstarch packing peanuts (I can't be the only one to have tried those.)  Sweetness also seems to have a light, very commercial, maple note to it.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This doesn't do funnel cake for me.  I wouldn't try to use this as a funnel cake.\n\nI do think it tastes a lot like French Toast Crunch. Whatever grain / bready note they are using here tastes a lot like breakfast cereal.  That and the maple from the sweetness, it's kind of odd. I think you can play with that quite a bit. I think if you added a bit of CAP Cereal 27 or maybe a tiny hit of straight Acetyl Pyrazine or FA Cookie you could reinforce that cereal note enough to hold up to milk.  The maple isn't really overwhelming, so I could easily see this working as a corn-pops type cereal.  I wouldn't call it straight corn flakes, but you may also be able to get close to that profile with a heavier hand with the AP.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, this seems pretty linear although that maple note to the sweetness seems to really come out at relatively higher percentages.  At 2%, this still feels pretty underflavored. I taste mostly that light maple glaze sweetness, with a really weak cereal body.  Like tossing those aforementioned edible packing peanuts in a bit of syrup. 4% has a stronger cereal body, still feels a bit weak but it's a bit more balanced with that sweetness. A bit more maple to it though. 6% has a firmer ceral texture but that maple has definitely come to the party. 8% doesn't seem to have a better cereal, but that maple is stronger.  I'd mix around 6% as a primary note, I don't feel like this concentrate really hits hard enough to use an accent.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nNah, still new.\n\n[Here's the Flavorwest product page.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FW Glazed Donut, 2 and 4%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 11 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Mostly glaze, very little donut. Glaze note is obviously on the sweet side.  Fairly close to a donut glaze, although at lower temperatures it seems to have a bit of earthy maple thing going on around the edges, and at higher temperatures it starts picking up a marzipan cherry. Either way, it's fairly subtle compared to the main glaze note but I feel like it's at least noticeable. Very little donut  taste here, and almost no donut texture. Some vagueish donut essence, but the darker outside of the donut without necessarily tasting fried.  Like scraping the glaze of the donut and have a couple of crumbs come with it.. i'd use this a generic bakery royal icing type glaze, I don't feel like the little bit of donut is really going to detract too much from another bakery profile.  I'd probably crank this up around 7-8%.\n\nInhale is sweet.  Not a dry powdery sugar, pretty true to the \"glazed\" part of this. At lower temperatures it tastes a bit muddy, with a light earthy note to it an a bit of something that tastes a lot like the maple I was getting off that FW Funnel Cake. What's strange is that when I start to bump up the tempature is starts to pick up some of the same bakery cherry that comes through in INW Marzipan. No real donut or grain though. A little on the airy side, and right on the verge of being cloyingly sweet.  Exhale is just a bit more complex.  I do get some really light airy donut in the top notes, but I'm still mostly tasting all that glaze. Glaze seems a bit cleaner on the exhale, either maple/cherry notes are still present, but not as pronounced. Texture is fairly close to that sugary glaze.  I'm not sure if they tend to add anything beyond sugar to donut glaze, but this seems like a very \"glaze\" flavored glaze.  Finish tastes pretty clean overall, maybe some lingering sugar lips.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  I'm used to the light maple with sugary tasting flavors, but I have no idea where that cherry came from.  I picked it up kind of randomly after some prolonged testing, and now I can't untaste it. I'd also say this doesn't really hit the profile for a glazed donut.  It's definitely more a donut glaze.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light.  Not particularly smooth, but nothing unbearable.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Well, you could run with it and just add it to a breadier donut base for the glaze note. Seems like the obvious solution.  I think this would probably work well as a royal icing as opposed to frosting note in lighter bakeries.  It doesn't have the texture, creaminess, or vanilla of a thicker frosting flavor, but it does manage to capture some of that bizarrely specific glaze character.\n\nSince my mind is on cereal, I could also see this being added to cereal recipes to get a sweeter coating on the cereal.  Kind of like the weird way that some breakfast cereal is vaguely shiny from the corn syrup or whatever they spray it with.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nConcentration testing, 2% is definitely light. Some sweetness here, but really generic and with pretty heavy off notes. 4% fills out quite a bit. Still geting those off-notes but they seem a bit further in the background. No donut to be found, but recognizable as the glaze. 6% is getting pretty cloying, but I feel like that's appropriate to a donut glaze.  Off flavors seem less pronounced again. 8% is starting to pick up some dryness for me.  That syrupy glaze is starting to take on a thin, unsatisfying meringue character but the off notes are still pretty tame. 10% tastes like spoiled FA Meringue to me with a hint of marzipan.  It's a donut glaze, so I'd probably go big, sweet, and dumb at around 7-8% with the expectation that you're going to be filling this out with a lot more body to stand up to that sweet note.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nIt's a new flavor, so not really.\n\n[Here's the product page from Flavorwest.

Check out the second opinions.\n\nHoly sucralose.  There's an artificial grape flavor in here. Seems a lot closer to a powdery kool-aid rather than a effervescent but still sweet grape soda.  The big difference between those two is probably mouthfeel, and this is dry.  Beyond the dry mouthfeel, the candy grape here has a bit of acetone grassiness.  It's a pretty full artificial grape flavor, but that sucralose is a bit much.  This feels like it goes well beyond the point of a tasteful accent.  This tastes like sucralose with grape flavor, as opposed to the other way around.  Flavorwest's SDS sheets are a bit hit and miss, but the [SDS for Grape Soda](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0542/2249/files/Grape_Soda_Flavor_N_A_FW-GSO.pdf?2777920788105979831) lists sucralose at 30-40% by weight.  Seems absolutely insane... but there's an issue with that SDS.  Given the numbers they've listed for everything else, their numbers don't add up to 100%.  They add up to 122-149% unless I I'm totally misreading what is actually going on there.  Judging by taste and coil gunk this has a ton of sucralose in there.  If you do want to rewick constantly and need a bright candy grape, the balancing on this is tricky.  I get way too much sucralose before the flavor fills in.  It's going to gunk at any percentage, but you'll probably get better results staying under 3% and using it as a grape sweetener for another less sucralose-laden grape.\n\nThe vaping experience on this varies wildly based on how much you vape. On fresh-ish wicks, the inhale is dry but vivid artificial grape flavor. Not really a harsh dryness, but it feels fairly well powdered. Like inhaling purple koolaid drink packets.  Exhale has that same dry, sweet, grape up front. Manages to avoid going full dimetapp, but it's lacking any sparkling or acidic character you'd get with grape soda. Lighter acetone top note.  Sucralose base, to the point that you're getting some artificial sweetener bitterness and chemical taste.  But that's all on fresh wicks. This gunks incredibly quickly, and by 3ml the flavor starts getting flat and muted.  Sweetener is slightly less taboo in DIY lately, but oversweetening has some really noticeable effects on how flavor works as everything just gunks all to hell.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Grape note isn't as bright and acidic as grape soda.  Incredibly dominant sucralose note, which drys out the vape substantially and leads to muting and flat dull flavor.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light from the acetoneish grassyness in the top notes, but then the sucralose kicks in and smooths everything out.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I would really just use this as grape flavored sucralose.  It's a profile specific sweetener for other grapes, berries, and fruit mixes.\n\nGrapes and creams or bakeries aren't really much of a category, but it'd probably work as a sweetener in there as well.\n\nMaybe keep it for the days you want to turn your brain off and don't mind rewicking.  There is no way I would want this near a tank where I was buying prebuilt coils.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing with this was weird. At 1%, there isn't much grape flavor here, more of a straight sucralose note with some light, dry artificial grape. At 3% you get a bit more grape, although I'd still argue it's pretty dominated by the sweetener. Grape underneath the sweetener feels a bit grassy and thin. At 6%, the grape has filled in quite a bit, but it's starting to taste incredibly dry.  I can also only get a couple drips in at this percentage before I want to rewick. At 10% the sucralose has a bitter chemical edge.  I don't know, I'd probably be closer to 7% with this as a primary note, but this will work as an sweetener at any percentage you want to try.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nPeople dig this stuff, apparently.\n\n[Here are the reviews on BCF. All positive, most note the coil gunking. User \"Chris\" says: \"Tastes spot on like grape koolaid. Great as a single flavor vape. I also use t to make grape bubblegum. This is a sweet flavor so be prepared to change coils more often.\" User \"Kate Herring\" is effusive: \"This flavor is everything I hoped that it would be. A tangy grape flavor that mixes perfectly with bubblegum! I used it at 10% which was perfect in my recipe. It could probably be cut back some with equally delicious results.\"  \"Devin Cook\" is just a bit more measured: \"It is very tasty but because of all the sugars it burns wicking material and gunks coils fast unless used as a mixer at low percentages. Ive found about 2.5% as mixer works great to sweeten. Or 5% for stand alone any higher and youll be changing cotton or coils very constantly. Dont get me wrong it is a great flavor though.\"](http://www.bullcityflavors.com/grape-soda-fw/)\n\n[Why not quote ID10-T.  \"FW Grape Soda. So much sucralose, it's insane. Major coil gunker and tastes like diet grape soda. Probably pretty yummy if you're into that sort of thing but it actually gives me a headache. \"](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/6fkj5g/participation_is_lagging_lately_its_time_to_make/)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FW Grapeberry Ice, 3 and 6%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 6 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Candy grape and a whole lot of cooling.  I'm definitely getting the grape loud and clear here, although I'm searching a bit for the \"berry\" part of it.  There might be a tiny bit of a mixed berry thing going on, but it's damn hard to tell past the cooling.  The cooling is pretty intense. Tastes like more of a heavy dose of Koolada than a menthol.  Ice might be an understatement. It's more a glacier of koolada.  This has a thicker heavy mouthfeel, but it definitely has that cardboard edge that shows up when overflavoring with Koolada.  Not terribly complex stuff, but it does the job well enough. The cooling here is a bit much for use as a single flavor, but you could cut it down with some additional fruit and come up with something perfectly vapable, if not really interesting.  I'd probably mix with this at around 3% solo, and a bit lower to taste with a fruit mix.\n\nInhale is candy grape.  There's a sweeter, grape base here although the cooling comes across really sharp and builds through the inhale.  The candy grape base is actually pretty well done, although it's hard to taste much nuance as that cooling ramps up. Exhale is just dominated by the cooling. It basically starts from your sinuses and just builds from the beginning of the exhale. Some candy warm, flat candy grape up front.  That warmth almost has a bit of a candy raspberry richness to it. Not a lot of nuance, but nothing really wrong with it either. Koolada on the back half, with a thick mouthfeel and intense cooling. There's some patented koolada cardboard on the tail end, and at higher percentages there's a bit of a bitter aftertaste.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Feels like a lot of koolada, and the off flavors are most due to the cooling getting weird at a relatively high percentage.  Cardboard edge to it, and some chemical bitterness.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Not much sting to it, but a pretty solid koolada icy throat hit.  Probably a feature and not a bug with that level of cooling.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  If FW Grape Soda is grape-flavored sucralose, this is grape flavored koolada. The balance is a bit better than Grape Soda, and the base candy grape comes through fairly well through the cooling.  I could see using it as the base for an easy fruit mix, adding some strawberry, kiwi, or something else bright.\n\nThis could also be used in a grape candy or bubblegum recipe at a low percentage. Some cooling tends to help those flavors pop a bit and cleans up the exhale so they don't get too sticky or cloying.\n\nIt's also not a bad solo flavor if you're into candy grape and a lot of cooling.\n\nSlushes are so June, but this does have a pretty impressive thicker mouthfeel if you can get around how flat this feels on the end of the exhale.\n\nThe amount of cooling here and the cardboard tendency would probably get more pronounced when mixed with anything creamy, so maybe avoid those.\n\nNot really a compelling reason to pick this up instead of getting a grape and some cooling separately, but what's here isn't bad.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nConcentration testing, this is going to be pretty intensely personal and it's all about how much cooling you can take.  At 1%, this feels about equivalent to .5% TPA Koolada in terms of cooling. Grape flavor is pretty light at this percentage. At 3% the grape is actually coming through pretty clear. Decently sweet and full, the cooling feels a bit too aggressive for me though. The grape flavor is just fine at 6%, but it doesn't seem like that much of an improvement over 3%.  There is substantially more cooling though, and it's a bit disconcertingly thick and tastes like cardboard on the end of the exhale.  10% is uncomfortably cold, and it's tasting bitter and chemical.  Everything is subjective, but cooling is extra subjective.  I can't see going above 3% with this, but this tastes largely fine higher around 5-6%.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Here's the ELR Page.  Percentage suggestions are closer to 10%.  User \"HighPlainsVaper\" writes: \"Grape flavor with Koolada. Not overly sweet. I add 1-2% sweetener.. Really good with sweet cream, or vanilla bean gelato, or Greek yogurt for a cool, fruity, creamy good vape.\"  I don't like this level of koolada with cream, but to each their own. User \"BandWheels\" adds: \"Good flavor for grape candy lovers, has a mild menthol kinda taste too. nice change from the norm....\"  Mild isn't how I would describe it.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/68364)\n\n[Mixed reviews on BCF.  An unknown user: \"The flavor was really good, but way too much ice. I can't use it. It really hurts the lungs.\"  User \"GBH\" is more positive: \"What can I say except for some reason I'm really I n love with this dumb flavor lol. Tastes like juicy grape candy with a slight cooling effect. Swear the vapor produced looks extra blue too. Tried it alone at 10% with 65% VG and I really enjoy it. No weird fake berry tastes just a nice grape candy vape without the sugar.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FW Green Goblin, 4 and 8%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 5 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  [Spot on OG Green Monster](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/27/99/41/279941af922dd02de61599d21b7e516f--monster-energy-nails-monster-nails.jpg), at least flavor wise.  Sweet, tastes like whatever unholy abomination of fruityish candy flavors normally in straight up monster, and even a surprisingly accurate version of that weird plasticy \"energy\" taste that monster has to it.  I still have no clue what real-world monster flavor is based on, but this definitely has that smarties dissolved in a vaguely citrusy battery acid thing that's true to profile.  The texture has some issues for a beverage vape though.  I think the sweetness level is pretty pleasant for a sugary profile, but solo it's a bit dry.  The bottom end of this has that heavy chalky sweetness, and the top notes are lit up with some citrus and that weird monster plastic flavor, but it feels a bit thin in the center though. I wouldn't overthink this... It's a solid base for an energy drink flavor that will play well with an added bright fruit flavor and some cooling. I'd stick to using this a stronger base for a mix, and probably mix around 6-8%.\n\nInhale is tart and sharp.  There's maybe some citrus in there, but it's honestly a bit hard to pick up much beyond that kind of plasticy \"monster\" energy flavor. It's certainly accurate to profile. Building sweet-tarts/smarties chalky candy sweetness underneath. Inhale seems a bit dry overall. Exhale has that same kind of non-descript tart, bitter top note right up front in the top notes. Accurately sweet monster-y base underneath those top notes. Seems to be a bit of hollow space in the middle of this flavor between where the top notes tail off a bit and the lower sweetness of the base.  Overall a bit dry and chalky in terms of mouthfeel. Lingering plastic monster taste.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Nothing really off from the profile.  With that said, monster tastes bizarre.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light, more from the dryness than the actual tarter parts of this concentrate.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I'm not sure there is such a thing as a \"hint\" of orginal monster flavor. Even the non-standard monsters just ditch the flavor entirely.  I'd just accent around it and fill it out a bit.\n\nI'd probably start with adding something a bit wet to kind of cut this a bit and moisten the vape.  My bet would be TPA Champagne, because the citrus in there should fit in pretty well and it helps to give a watery volume. INW Cactus or CAP Cucumber would probably work, although they'd drag the profile in a different direction.\n\nI also think some cooling would help.\n\nIf you're going add in an accent flavor I'd stick with a big, bright, and non-floral fruit.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, this seems to be a weaker flavor but it's pretty linear.  It's definitely on the light side at 2%.  More just a hint of that monster plastic taste, and some watery sweetness. At 4% it still seems thin and watered down.  6% seems fuller overall.  A little sweeter, decent body, and suffiecently monstery.  I'd stop here if you don't plan on adding something to thin out the mix.  At 8% it's a solid sweetness and it feels like it's getting drier.  Flavor is bold but not quite overpowering. At 10% this is getting too sweet, dry, and maybe just a bit bitter. 12% feels like eating monster-flavored kool-aid mix.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Here's a reddit thread from a couple years ago about using this concentrate.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FW Hard Candy @ 1% and 3%, Others noted. 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 35 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Tasting this solo, I get mostly hairspray with a sticky mouth feel.  If you want weirdly specific, it tastes like manual pump hair spray smells, as opposed to the stuff in pressurized cans.  A bit of sweetness here, but definitely an additive as opposed to a distinct flavor. At least solo, this is pretty overwhelming at 3%. Gets a bit harsh and that hairspray taste is really aggressive.  More subtle at 1%, with most of the same sticky kind of mouthfeel.  That mouthfeel is a bit hard to describe, but it likes the midway point between gelatin and normal sugar lips.\n\n**Off Flavors:**  Yeah, the chemical hair spray thing. The entire thing is an off-flavor to deal with to get to the mouthfeel.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  At 1%, not a ton. Gets moderately harsh at 3%.\n\n**Additive Tests:**  I've used this an a couple of test mixes at varying percentages to feel out it's use as an additive.\n\n**2% DIY FS Holy Vanilla, 1% FW Hard Candy:** The surprise hit. Mutes some of the maltier, sour notes I get from Holy Vanilla and really rounds out and thickens the mouthfeel. Reads a bit like a creamsaver, which is a good thing. I don't get any of the hairspray taste from the hard candy at this percentage. Worth exploring creamier concentrates a bit more with this at 1%.\n\n**3% FW Root Beer, 2% FW Hard Candy:**  It was hoping for root beer barrels, I'm still not sure exactly what I actually ended up. This is odd. The spicier parts of the Root Beer have been kind of hollowed out, and 2% of the Hard Candy is enough to make it a bit weird and chemical. The sweetness of the root beer and the sweetness of the hard candy also seem to working against each other and getting really muddy.  Maybe a bit too much mouthfeel and a bit too sticky.\n\n**4% OSDIY Blue Raspberry Slush, 3% FW Hard Candy:**  Definitely too high on the Hard Candy. Clear hairspray taste. Again, the sweetness in the blue raspberry and the hard candy are kind of fighting each other and muddying everything up substantially. Hard Candy taking down some of the brightness of the blue raspberry. Stickyness is a bit off-putting here.  I was thinking jolly rancher, but this is kind of a mess.\n\n**Notes:**  So based on the additive testing, I'd keep the use of Hard Candy relatively low at about 1% or under.  Based on the tests, I'd pair this with non-candy flavors, trying to make those more candy-like rather than starting with really sweet candy flavors and pushing those even further towards candy.  Hard Candy seems to do a good job of toning down floral and sharp notes, so maybe through something relatively floral like peach, pear, raspberry, or apple at this.  Also surprisingly okay with creamier concentrates.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[ELR Page has a couple notes. Wildly varying percentage recommendations. I definitely lean toward the low side here.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/18859)\n\n[ECX reviews net out to positive, but the opinions vary quite a bit.

Some balanced tartness and lighter perfumey top notes.  A bit of cooling herbal mint and anise kind of bite.\n\nInhale is all deep, almost syrupy dark candy blueberry. Dense and heavy with just a bit of harshness. Exhale is sweet, with blueberry syrup right up front. Higher, floral blackberry notes with a slight cooling herbal mint tinge and a spicy anise / basil bit of spice.  Fairly subtle blackcurrant tartness and funk. Sweet, but reads as mostly natural with no aspartame edge.  Dense but just a bit dry, lacking a really juicy, syrupy edge.  Lingering spicy, dry notes and a bit of waxy mouthfeel. \n\n**Off Flavors:** Light cooling spearmint / anise on top. Not ovewhelming, but it's there.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Nothing major.

Heavy enough body to stand up as a good primary note in mixes.\n\nGood candidate to provide most of the body for a blueberry cream or custard mix with some help from something like FA Bilberry for a more realistic blueberry or FW Blueberry for a candy blueberry.\n\nIn bakeries, I think this should work as a kind of commercial \"blueberry\" kind of flavor. With some added liquid amber or a jammy fruit in the mix it should do a good job of pulling off some of the deeper sweet flavor of a blueberry jam.\n\nGood candidate for a blueberry-esque berry note for a dry sweet tobacco. Strong enough to stand out, but not juicy enough to swamp a mix.  Doesn't seem to have any of that red berry woodiness or heavy syrupy texture.\n\n**Notes:** S&V concentration testing, seems to be best between 1.5-2%. I get a fairly weak flavor at .25 and .5%. Just some light indistinct berry sweetness. 1% has a fairly full flavor, but it lacks some definition. 1.5% is good, with a nice mix of sweetness and a clearer dark berry flavor. 2% has those cooling herbal mint show up, but as a light accent to the blueberryish depth here. 3% is a bit sharp and floral, still workable but I'm getting some harshness. 4% is pretty solidly floral, and the berry sweetness isn't really any better or stronger than 2%.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Good reviews on BCF.

Smooth through the nose and lungs. Slight creamy mouth feel.\n\n**Flavor Properties**- Nutty, almost earthy with a creamy back note.\n\n**Relatable Flavors** - Doesn't really taste like any macadamia nut I've had. It's obviously not unsalted, it has some sweetness to it (not honey) but it just tastes very off.\n\n**Off Flavors** - There is a strong aftertaste on the exhale. I'm not sure if its just me but I can discern the taste even after using it in one of my mixes. It almost tastes burnt, like when you leave bread inside a toaster for a minute too long, and you can't shake off the taste even after scraping the black edges.\n\n**Position In The Recipe** - This will probably work as an accent note. I can't see it being a base note just because of the color (its black as tar) and the odd chemical taste.\n\n**Pairings** - In small amounts, you could probably use this in some trail mix recipe or honey roasted nuts. Although again, I don't know anyone who would find this taste appealing.\n\n**End notes** - In my humble opinion, you can ignore this flavor. It's not a good macadamia flavoring, it's not a good flavoring, period. Because of the color alone, it will fuck up your coils in a day or two. And it leaves a super unpleasant exhale taste which I just can't see working anywhere... Someone just posted that this contains corn syrup (which is unsafe to vape), avoid at all costs.",

I don't know, I'm going to split the difference. I can see how this is a cherimoya flavor, and I can see this as a kind of bad mango and floral blackberry mix.\n\nInhale is fairly thin candy banana with sharper floral berry notes.  Exhale has a banana candy tinged dry mango base.  Higher artificial berry or apple top notes. Moderate density, but again dry as opposed to fluffy. Sort of medium sweet, but with a hollow kind of sweetness you get from diet sodas.  No real juice to this, more like a candy flavor without the level of sweetness you'd expect. Lingering perfumey top notes.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Even at 10% tastes thin and artificial. It has an asparatame kind of edge to it without a heavy sweetness. Not enough juicy body to really carry that flavor without tasting astringent and weird.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Light.  By the time you get a full flavor out of this you have quite a bit of a perfumey edge to deal with.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I'm kind of at a loss. There are multiple good cherimoya flavors out there that are more concentrated and have some actual body, so I'm not seeing much of a use for it.\n\nIf this is indeed some kind of a berry and mango mix, it's not a particularly good one.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nMy first test of this was at 3%, and it was really weak. Light flavor all around.  6% was a bit better, giving a more solid bottom end here, although you start notice that artificial edge on that mango-ish flavor here.  It took going up to 9% to really get a full flavor out of this. 12% is getting too floral and sharp.  If you're bound and determined to use this, maybe start at 10%?\n\nI'm always wondering if I'm missing out on something with the obtusely named flavorwest flavors, but it doesn't really seem like it with this one.  Too weak to be useful at low percentages, and too weird to be useful at high percentages.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[/u/l33fty/ calls it a real cherimoya type flavor on a review of FLV Soursop.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/5ahfyh/flv_soursop/)  [Continues with \"FW Magma Current 15% mic drop\" on the FOTW for Custard Apples.](\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/5n4rli/an_exotic_flavor_of_the_week_the_custard_apple/)\n\n[Not much popping on ELR.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FW Malt, 2 and 4%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 16 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Fairly funky, aggressive malt flavor.   Solo, I'd say it's closer to the malt from malt liquor rather than the malt from a malted milk but missing the roasted note I'd want from either.  On the green, vegetal side like it's the whole sprouted grain instead of a cleaner tasting powdered malt.  The combination of that greeness, and that malt liquor sweetness is a bit odd.  Very distinct flavor, but the actual vape seems a bit airy.  In terms of usage percentage, this flavor works better at higher percentages around 6%, but I don't want all that much of it, so I'd probably be using this an accent lower at around 1.5-2%.\n\nInhale is actually about as clean as this flavor end ups tasting.  Warm malt up front with a pretty heavy building sweetness.  This is less green on the inhale, but you still get some of that vegetal astringency especially as the flavor builds with a long inhale. Exhale is more green than the inhale.  Sweet malt base in there, but it doesn't really have the toasted note that would make this more pleasant. Top notes are all that greener flavor.  This is an aggressive, clear flavor, but it seems to be a bit dead and airy in the middle. Some light throat hit to it.  Lingering vegetal, astringent note.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  This has a real green edge to this.  Almost like a celery/rhubarb astringency with some earthiness and almost a boozy sharpness.  There is some or the more mellow malt I'd want, but it's definitely funky and green.  Green note is less prevalent with some extra heat, but it's still there.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light.  Nothing major but a bit sharp.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I think this would probably work better on the adult beverage side of mixes rather than trying to blend into in a sweeter bakery profile. A small percentage of this could add some body and interest to whiskey heavy mixes.  FLV Bourbon in particular does a great oak note, this could help sweeten and fill that out a bit.  I think the boozy notes from liquor concentrates will help take some of the green edge of this in a mix.  For the elusive beer vape, I feel like HS Beer is probably a better malt flavor that'll fit better with the profile.\n\nFor sweeter mixes, you may be sneak a little bit of this into a cream to get a bit of a malted milk effect. I'd start low to try to stay away from overwhelming the cream with that greener note, but it could be fun especially if you end up vaping warmer.  Should work a little bit better with chocolate, letting you go in an ovaltine kind of direction but again, with a very light touch from this flavor.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, 1% is just too light, I don't want a ton of this flavor to come out, but it's kind of bitter without that sweeter malt.  2% has some actual malt to it. Still a bit thin, but it's a bit more green than better. 4% is getting sweet, but that green note is pretty prominent. Flavor still feels like it's filling in.  At 6%, this flavor actually works really well.  It feels nice and full and the green note seems balanced. But it's not necessarily something you want to taste a whole lot of.  8% is feeling pretty bitter and sharp.  So I'm kind of torn, if you want sweet sprouted grains, crank this up to 6% and it works beautifully.  If you want just a light malt accent, stay low with this an work up.  Flavor doesn't work as well, but you probably don't want it to.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nNah, still new.\n\n[Here's the Flavorwest product page.](http://flavorwest.com/index.php/malt.html)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**\n\n[Bonus video first taste of FW Wild Berry Cobbler, S'mores, Butterbeer and Malt.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAPpFYNfptI)",

The inhale is the best part of this one, like smelling a freshly sliced mango. The exhale is where it gets slightly weird, it starts off great and kind of fizzles out. Its got a lot of the mango top notes, which is good, but its lacking anything juicy or nectar like. I’m getting a decent flavor in the beginning, slightly floral/sweet/bright/creamy but on the exhale I lose a lot of those positive notes and I’m left with a lightly mangoed, slightly creamy vg taste. This one lacks any real body or juicy factor to it.\n\n**Off-flavors**: Not a 100% spot on mango, maybe it’s just weak but the VG peeks through, also just a smidge floral but not overwhelming at all (possibly expected even)\n\n**Throat hit**: Smooth, almost nothing.\n\n**Uses**: This can pair with many fruits to provide nice mango top notes, IMO it’s weaker so I’d start at 3% as an accent in mixes and maybe go up to 6-8% as a mango base. TBH, I would start somewhere else if you’re looking for mango, I’d give this one a 70/100.  I don’t think I would pair this with creams as it would probably get lost. \n\nAs of now the only other mango I have is INW. This doesn’t work well with INW, they’re both a bit floral so not a great mix. I’d pair this with a more sweet nectar / meaty mango flavor like CAP sweet mango, TFA Philippine mango, or HS mango.\n\n**Pairings**: Most fruits, other mangos. Maybe cream but I haven’t tried. \n\n**Notes**: Works as a shake and vape doesn’t change much, I actually had an older bottle and I mixed it again to make sure but the older bottle (maybe 2 months) didn’t taste much different. Again, I’d look to another concentrate for mango stuff but this one worked nicely for me with strawberry and pineapple and a little EM. Have not messed too much with it but I will give it another try after I pick up some other mango flavors to mix it with. \n\nIf this were anything I’d say it’s a mango juice or maybe the flavor of like a mango slushy, just not as sweet. Lacks any real meat to it.\n\nMight get the job done in certain mixes.\n\n**Second Opinions**\n\n[Good reviews on ECX,  one touted it as a strong and true mango flavor, maybe they used it at a higher % or maybe I’m broken]( http://www.ecigexpress.com/diy-e-liquid/diy-e-liquid-flavors/flavor-west/flavor-west-naturals/natural-mango-by-flavor-west.html#review-list)\n\n\n[Some notes on ELR one saying “natural, but not fleshy; little sweet”]( http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/25461)\n\nedit: grammar, % used\n\n[FW site says natural citrus flavorings will vary from batch to batch](http://m.flavorwest.com/item/333232)",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FW Martini @ 3%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 16 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Dry vermouth, all the way.  No gin here. Legitimate aromatics and some slight white wine sourness. Thin and dry, suprisingly accurate, at least on the vermouth front.\n\nInhale is herbaceous with being green or vegetal at all. Slightly sharp and bitter with a delicate sourness. Thin exhale, again with that light sourness and just a tiny bit of sweetness toward the back end.  Exhale has that light herb note which is damn near impossible for me to nail down.  What i do get clearly is some sort of quinine bitterness that shows up on the back end of the exhale..  It's also floral but not perfumey at 3%.  That floral note has almost a soft violet or maybe even lilac taste.  Really complex here, but it's accurate for dry vermouth.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Nothing feels out of place here.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Very light to none. It's a slightly bitter and thin flavor, but it in that context it's pretty damn smooth.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:** Honestly, I'd consider this a single flavor vape at 3%.  It manages to be floral with being too perfumey, and the light sweetness is really pleasant.  If you have any interest in vaping a dry vermouth, give it a shot.\n\nThe other obvious use is a cocktail vape.  As it stands, a really solid dry vermouth.  If you add in a little heavier spice (i'm thinking INW Shisha Punch) and a sweet boozy note like FA brandy you could pull of a sweet vermouth.  Those quinine notes would also work as a stand-in for lillet if you need it, with maybe a drop of FLV Bourbon to bring the oak back in.\n\nHaving a decent vermouth on deck ends up bringing a whole bunch of classic cocktails into play.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nS&V concentration testing, 3% seems like the sweet spot here. Under 3% and those soft floral and herbal notes are a little muted and soft.  You're missing some of the light sour mouthfeel that sells this as dry vermouth as well.  Above 3%, those florals seem get a bit aggressive and you pick up the hits of lilac perfume and the sourness gets a bit much.  I'd either vape this solo at 3%, or mix at 3% and rely any heavier boozier flavors to throw enough elbows to muscle up to the front.  Also of note, this is super harsh as a S&V.  You get a hot alcohol note along with much sharper florals that could pass as the missing gin portion until it calms down in a straight dry vermouth after a 5 days to a week.\n\nIf it isn't clear, I'm a fan. If it sounds even remotely interested in a dry vermouth, or really any kind of apertif/digestif type of vape this is good call.  As far I can tell, there isn't a ton of competition here and this is solid.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nNah, man. Not that I can find. Again, don't go expecting anything but a dry vermouth experience and I think you'll be happy with it.\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

The Flavor West page shows the same graphic, but lists it as \"Menthol (Liquid)\" with the description \"Natural Menthol (Liquid) Flavoring\".\n\nFW states \"Usage Rate 15-20% for E-use\".  ELR shows 1 to 2.5% for Percentages in recipes and  8.1 to 10% for single flavor mixes.  Reddit posts were all over the map.  Where to start?  I went with 2%.\n\nAbout a year ago, I got 2 bottles of Banzai Subzero at 18mg/ml nic.  I tried it and liked the cool sensation, but the nic was way too high for me.  I'm currently vaping 3% nic.  Subzero's menthol flavor is harsh and not particularly tasty, but that cool sensation is fun.\n\nA 2% single flavor mix vapes really nice in a dripper.  I get the cool sensation, and the flavor is equal part menthol and part light peppermint.  Much tastier than Subzero.\n\nI plan on increasing the concentration and testing in a tank, and testing in a MTL setup, too.\n\n* 24 hours later: tried the 2% mix in the Goblin Mini V1 tank.  The Goblin Mini is a pretty good flavor tank, but most of the cool sensation is not there.  Tested again in a dripper and the cool is still there, no change,  just as good as yesterday.  Tomorrow, I'll make a 4% mix.\n* 24 more hours later: the 4% mix is noticeable and pleasant in the Goblin Mini.  It is at least twice as strong in the dripper.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FW Mojito, 2 and 4%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 7 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Sugar with lime.  I can't find any mint in here, maybe a light bit of cooling on the exhale, but no real taste of mint. Nothing that tastes like rum. Just a sort of generically fruity white sugar taste with some lime in the background coming through clearer on the back end.  With all that sugar, the lime note tastes a lot like the lime from fruity pebbles.  Very sweet. I've got that DIY palate where sweetener tastes a little weird, but this is just stupid.\n\nInhale is sweet. Just sweet. Dry, grainy texture. Turns out vaping sugar syrup is like eating white sugar raw, at least texture wise. Some lighter lime building through the inhale, but that sugar is up front. Exhale tastes a lot like a bowl of dry green fruity pebbles. Lighter lime, no real zest. Dry grainy texture. Lots of sweetness. Heaps of white sugar.  Lime is a bit clearer right at the end, i can almost pick out a zest note. Maybe a hint of cooling?  Lingering sugar lips and a gnawing sense of regret.\n\nAlso worth noting that [FW's SDS for this has it listed at 15-25% sugar syrup](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/6pon5hhbk4aasnu/AAAlb_B4drZ2XyTnwsuf_RtTa/SDS?dl=0&preview=Mojito+Flavor+N%26A+FW-MJI.pdf)... so that's probably not good. Diketones are awesome, but the sugar syrup is probably a bridge too far.  Cancer cake is up at 20-30% fructose, so I guess it's no more unsafe than that?\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Most mojitos have some kind of simple syrup or sugar thrown in while muddling the mint. This has no mint, just simple syrup. So all that sugar, and then all that sugar being burnt.\n\n**Throat Hit:**    Light until the burned notes from your coil gunk show up.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  FW Cancer Cake kind of gets a pass on the fructose because it's delicious.  That one might be worth the health risk.  This just straight tastes like sugar. I wouldn't use it in a juice. Use it to sweeten your iced tea or something.  If the health risk doesn't bother you, then it's probably just not worth having to rewick multiple times a day.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, this seems linear. White sugar at 1%, light lime. More white sugar at 2%, lime is a bit less light. 3% is getting really solid and grainy. 4% is intensely sweet, more lime flavored sugar than sweetened lime. 5% is pretty much just burning.  Sweet, burnt, sugar with lime.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Here's the ELR Page. Multiple copies of the same review, so I'm unsure who to credit, but: \"Smells like margarita, but doesn't taste completely like one. A hint salty. Semi Sweet. Spits a fair bit off the RDA.

Pretty intense zest up front, with a sweeter grapefruit base.  Manages to capture the \"ruby red\" part of the grapefruit pretty well. This is quite a bit heavier on zest than FW Blood Orange, but it works in a similar way to give a bit of earthiness and sweetness with that citrus flavor.  Nice balance between sweetness and citrus tartness. It's a bit harsh to use solo as a grapefruit flavor, but it pairs really well with sweeter grapefruit concentrates and syrupy, dark fruits to add some citrus freshness and tartness that isn't lime or lemon. I'd use this as a supporting flavor around 2%, and up to 4% as a primary flavor if you have something to kind of round the harsh edges off this.\n\nInhale has sharp, tart grapefruit zest up front.  Sweet grapefruit base underneath with a bit of juicyness if you can get past the harshness here.

Exhale again starts out with a pretty intense zest. Accurate grapefruit zest all up in the top notes. Sweeter but nicely tart grapefruit base underneath. That \"ruby red\" earthiness and sweetness comes out clearer in the exhale. Less like a white grapefruit with something extra than a full ruby red flavor. A little bit of sticky, syrupy sweetness and some actual juice there. Still moderately dense, but on the harsh side from that zest note. Lingering zest and sugar lips.\n\nThe name, on BCF at least, has either changed from Ruby Red to Natural Ruby Red... or I'm just dense and noticed it recently.  Even if it did change and I'm not dense, I'm fairly sure they are the same concentrate, or at least comparable. Testing an older bottle I have around alongside a freshly ordered bottle it seems to be identical if maybe a bit flatter out of my old bottle.  It's a 1/4 full 120 that I've had for at least 6 months, so it's probably just the top notes evaporating off a bit. FW's website only lists the Natural version, but I'm not sure if that is a recent development.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  This is pretty zest heavy. I think it's a pretty accurate grapefruit zest, but it's definitely a a bit distracting from the ruby red grapefruit underneath.\n \n**Throat Hit:**  Moderate to Harsh. I love this stuff, but solo it's a bit harsh.  You know it's a citrus, basically.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I think this is a accurate ruby red grapefruit, but it definitely needs something to calm down all that zest. It benefits a lot from either some straight ethyl maltol at around .25% or another flavor with a good deal of maltol.\n\nIn terms of pairings, it's pretty much standard citrus. The earthyness from this tends to do weird thing to cucumber flavors, but it goes well with strawberries, cranberries, and raspberries. Also works pretty well with medium body creams. It's a bit of bully for something like FA Fresh Cream, and the buttery notes in custards don't really work.\n\nThis pairs really well with FLV Pink Guava for a realistic grapefruit. [Shameless plug time.](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/13499#terrorhawk_by_concreteriver)  If you pair with something like CAP Grapefruit it gets closer to something like grapefruit juice.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, this is mostly zest at 1%. Not much body to it, just harsh zest. Body fills in a bit more at 2% but it's still zest heavy. 3% is fuller overall. Not much harsher than 2%, but has an earthier, sweeter note. It definitely feels more ruby red at 3%. 4% is getting a bit sticky in the sweetness. Not unpleasant, but it's starting to feel a bit disjointed between the zest up top and the sweeter base. 5% pushes that disjointed thing a bit further. It's a bit too earthy here.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Here is the ELR Page for the natural version.  User \"LostMarbles\" says: \"Very close to the real thing. Not overly tart but can overwhelm other flavors if percentage is too high. Recommend start at 3%.\"  User \"Chewy\" weighs in with: \"Now this IS a great red grapefruit taste.

    "markdown": "**Flavor West Peach Review**\n\nAs you all probably already know by now, I purchased a shit ton of flavorings recently. However, I made a conscious decision to pick flavorings that are not constantly spoken about. \n\nOne of the companies that comes to mind is Flavor West. Flavor West has been one of the few companies that have gotten a lot of flak in the DIY community. And of course, with good reason. They lied to the masses about potentially unsafe ingredients in certain flavorings. Also, a lot of the flavorings are just really juvenile sounding and lack promise (Monkey Fart, Reindeer Poop, Pig Sap and many others come to mind). Couple that with a lot of bad reviews on the internet and you're gonna have a bad day.\n\nAll those things do not concern me though. As a mixer, my job is to find flavorings that deliver exceptional flavor. So I'm going to view this entirely objectively. Let's get to the review.\n\n\n**My build:**\n\nKayfun 5 with Therion 75w, Vaped at 30 watts on a single coil build. 0.5 ohms.\n\n**Percentage Mixed**\n\nMixed standalone at 5%\n\n**Steep Time:**\n\nIt's a fruit, so no steep time is necessary although I let it sit for 24 hours/1 day.\n\n**First impressions:**\n\nThere's not too much to say about the color. It's pretty much clear as day, which is to be expected with fruit flavorings. \n\nThe aroma reminds me of a ripened peach, it smells so sweet that I can almost taste the nectarine. I am also immediately reminded of a popular gummy peach candy. \n\n**Taste:**\n\nOh wow, this is a pleasant surprise. It smells the way it tastes. I get ripe, sweet peaches with an underlying nectar taste. But wait, what's that hitting the back of my throat. Oh no, I'm getting a dreaded perfume taste. I can't shake it off. It's faint and you can probably mask it with creams and desserts, but it's definitely there. \n\nDid I mix this too high? Perhaps. I might have to revisit this at a lower percentage... \n\n**Standalone/Mixer:**\n\nIt's actually both. It could work as a good standalone if you lean that way. But I feel it would shine exceptionally well with a cream or bakery back note. I am also pretty convinced that this is the peach they are using in FW Peach Tobacco. \n\nIf you can get past the perfumey taste, this is a decent flavoring. Try adding another peach into the mix like FA White Peach or FA Peach to add a little dimension to it.\n\n**Is this 4oz worthy?**\n\nUnfortunately, no. Because of the dreaded perfume taste, I don't see myself vaping much of this. However, take note that this could be entirely my fault for mixing it at 5%. It could be one of FW's stronger offerings. I'll need to revisit this one in the future.",

Another Super dense flavor 8 out of 10.\n\n**Throat Hit**\n\n4/10\n\n**Flavor Properties** \n\nThe flavoring can be broken into two parts pineapple and Peach.\n\n*Pineapple - this flavor comes out sweet and juicy with just a touch of citrus. Pineapple is very realistic fresh crisp pineapple not that canned garbage you get on a pizza. It has a juicy slightly syrupy aspect to it adding to the density of the flavoring.\n\n*Peach - slightly candied Peach flavoring similar to Peach gummies rings. But I also get that slightly fuzzy fantastic Peach skin. I'd say the peach in this is halfway between a candy and a very authentic flavoring.\n\n\n**Position In The Recipe**\n\nFlavoring is super dense and because of that I believe will work best as a base note. \n\n**Off Flavors**\n\nThe fuzzy flavoring about Peach skin comes off very dry and although this flavoring is wet and juicy, it still somehow still dry on the inhale.\n\n**Pairings**\n\nFlavoring should pair well with most Citrus flavorings. A few fruits such as Apple, and dragon fruit. Vanilla and tobaccos should also pair nicely.\n\n**Notes**\n\n\nPurchased this on a whim, I was interested to see how flavor West, combined these two profiles.  I have to say I am pleasantly surprised. This could easily be a single flavor mix or part of a complex profile. Reminds me a lot of Coke cans nebula recipe.\n\n**Rating**7\n\n80/100\n\nPlease if your opinion differs, or you have another review for this post , then leave a fucking comment. ;p\n",

Smooth through the nose and lungs. Moderate creamy mouth feel (no homo)\n\n**Flavor Properties**- I get swirls of caramel and nutty undertones with bits of crushed pecans. For those who have never had Pralines & Cream (in which case, I would ask what the fuck is wrong with u?), its actually caramel mixed in with pecan nuts with vanilla bean ice cream. unfortunately, i do not get much, or any at all, of vanilla bean ice cream\n\n**Relatable Flavors** - almost like a butter pecan ice cream, but less buttery, with more gooey caramel upfront \n\n**Off Flavors** - There is a bit of an aftertaste which i can't put my fingers on. I get the same taste with fw macadamia nut and a few other fw flavors. since it's so mild, i believe some basic layering will make it go away\n\n**Position In The Recipe** - Like a lot of FW flavors, this would be great as a base note. I could imagine making a really creamy and nutty ice cream with this. It could even work as an accent note, creamy, smooth, sweet and nutty. Similar to FW Hazelnut.\n\n**Pairings** - I would imagine this going well with other nuts (peanut butter, almond), or some kind of cream base (vanilla bean, fresh cream, etc). It might even work with fruits (if you like the juxtaposition of fruits and nuts). Feel free to add some FA Caramel or FW Caramel candy in there to reinforce the caramel notes.\n\n**End notes** - This is a great flavoring. If you like nutty and creamy flavors like FW Hazelnut or TFA Pistachio, I would recommend this one for sure. Also, be patient as I have a few more flavor reviews in the pipeline. Will be posting 'em later after I come back from dinner. ",

I would give it 8 out of 10. Sharp and a little dusty.\n\n**Throat Hit** 5/10\n\n**Flavor Properties** \n\n Alright here we go. Pumpkin spice, a combination of nutmeg, cinnamon, and clove. This particular flavoring is heavy on the cinnamon and you get an earthy, woody, flavoring along with that cinnamon, which is very realistic in that regard.\n\nNutmeg is tricky, especially with all these other flavorings going on, but I'm definitely getting the perception of nutmeg.\n\nThe clove is almost non-existent which is perfect for me, as most pumpkin spice or holiday spice flavorings are far too heavy on the clove. Clove is a flavoring that is hard to do in small amounts and I would commend Flavor West for near leaving it out of this pumpkin spice. I taste it but it's just a whisper. With all other pumpkin spice flavorings I have tested, there is an overpowering clove that needs to be dumped down.\n\nAs far as the pumpkin flavoring goes, I'm not getting any squash. This more of a mixture of spices but it is creamy and dense along with the spices, giving some perception of a nice thick pumpkin pie with just an idea of the actual squash flavoring.\n\n\n**Relatable Flavors** \n\nFlavoring reminds me of the spices that go in pumpkin pie. As far as a standalone pumpkin pie flavor, it's going to need some help..\n\n**Position In The Recipe** \n\nThis flavoring could be very useful as an accent, but I feel the intent behind the flavoring was to make it a base flavor, and build off that. It's going to need some help.\n\n**Off Flavors**\n\nSuper dusty cinnamon and nutmeg combination was a little off-putting but authentic. After vaping about 5 milliliters, I'm unclear whether I would consider this an off flavor or just a really authentic representation of spices.\n\n**Pairings** \n\nFruits, berries, bakeries, vanilla, coffee, cream, and maybe some candies such as caramel and butterscotch.\n\nCould also pair well with a lot of other herb and spice flavorings.\n\n\n**Notes** \n\nI purchased several of these flavorings looking to make a spiced latte or pumpkin chocolate chip cookie. I'm afraid that the search goes on for that pumpkin flavoring I'm looking for to do the chocolate chip cookie.\n\nHere is a little information from Wikipedia if you're interested:\n\n https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumpkin_pie_spice\n\n Oh look there's allspice in here as well. That may also have been added to the dusty flavoring.\n\n**Rating** 85/100\n\n**Please if your opinion differs, or you have another review for this flavor add it in the comments.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FW Raspberry, 3 and 6%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 7 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  A very artificial raspberry flavor.  The raspberry itself definitely tastes more in the raspberry candy family, but it's missing some of the richer, warm, juicy sweetness you can get with other raspberry flavors. I don't really taste a floral note, but there's this off-putting perfumey and bitter chemical taste in the same space in the top notes where the florals usually show up.  Closer to an artificial mixed berry flavor than a realistic raspberry.  Mouthfeel is actually a little dry and chalky.  Overall effect is sort of medicinal and odd.  With better raspberries available, I'd be tempted to skip this one.\n\nInhale is bitter and sharp.  Flat candy raspberry sweetness builds through the inhale with a dryer mouthfeel.  Feels a bit airy overall, not quite dense and coherent even at 6%, but it's all sorts of bitter and chemical up that hight. Exhale starts with some candy raspberry bordering on generic mixed berry flavor.  Sweet, but dry.  Almost like a raspberry smartie or pixy-stik. Top notes are kind of a mess. High, bitter flavor with a distinct chemical edge.  That chemical taste lingers for quite a while after the vape. Stil feel airy. Raspberry flavor is okay but the combination of the drier, airier mouthfeel and bitter edge seem pretty off-putting.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Not a realistic raspberry, but too sharp and dry for a convincing candy raspberry. Pretty heavy bitter chemical edge to it all.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Pretty harsh solo.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I'm not sure there are any places where you wouldn't be better suited by another raspberry.  If you want an artificial, candy raspberry both FLV Raspberry and TPA Raspberry Sweet do a better job without that weird chemical bitterness and a thicker mouthfeel.\n\nThis doesn't taste much like a realistic raspberry, so I'd stick with INW or FA Raspberry.\n\nThis doesn't really do a rich enhanced raspberry flavor for bakeries or creams like INW Shisha Raspberry would.\n\nIf you were going to use this, I'd try to hide in the background of a busy fruit mix somewhere and use that drier texture and the sweetness it brings to the table.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, this doesn't really have a percentage where it works well. 1% isn't actively offensive, but I'm not getting much raspberry out of it. Tastes sweet and bitter without much actual flavor. At 3%, the raspberry is a bit more prominent and full, but that bitter edge is staring to get really obtrusive.  I'm not finding enough raspberry in here to really balance out that sharp chemical edge.  At 6%, the raspberry that is in here tastes a bit muted, it's more up front but it's missing some of that warmer sweetness from at 3%.  The bitterness is starting to chemical as well.  At 10%, it's kind of a mess.  Sweet, dry off notes.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nApparently people like this stuff well enough, I could just be off-base. \n\n[A three and five star on BCF.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FW Reindeer Poop, 2 and 4%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 9 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Flavorwest describes this as \"Warm Cinnamon Roll Topped with Vanilla Ice Cream and Chocolate Syrup Flavor.\" Why is it called reindeer poop? Googling for said reindeer poop points to chocolate covered peanuts.  It is a mystery.  This basically tastes like a softer chocolate cinnamon roll.  The vanilla ice cream component of this ends up making the drier cinnamon roll base taste a little softer and a bit richer, but not really doughy.  Bakery cinnamon is pretty similar to straight FW Cinnamon Roll and actually pretty well balanced without drying out the vape.  Chocolate is interesting, I'm not getting a discrete layered kind of chocolate syrup.  Tastes more like their was some sort of cocoa powder in the actual cinnamon roll dough.  The flavor description makes it sound layered, but it's all kind of a big lump of flavor. It's all fairly well executed and not a bad solo flavor, but I'm sort of at loss about what to do with because there is already quite a bit going on here. Seems to need about 6% to get going.\n\nInhale has some pretty solid AP type of vaguely acidic bite to it, which is odd because I don't get much distinct breadiness through the entire vape. Some building chocolate and cinnamon underneath that.  On the sweet side, but not too cloying for a cinnamon roll.  Exhale has bakery cinnamon up front, with some higher cocoa note. Medium dense but softer cinnamon roll body without any real bready or yeasty notes but still a bit of grainy texture. Tail end of the exhale is mostly a light vanilla and a heavier chocolate. No real frosting or topping that I can tell. Just kind of an amorphous (but pretty good) wad of chocolate cinnamon roll.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Inhale is a bit odd overall. No real off flavors on the exhale, but it doesn't seem layered in the way that the description would make you think.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Not a lot on the exhale, but this has a sharp inhale like overflavoring with AP. No heavy corn-chipish flavor like I'd expect with that level of sharpness, but it's still a bit odd.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Again, I'm not even sure. It's pretty busy and full already.  It's not a bad bakery base if you need both chocolate and cinnamon for something. I could see maybe adding some softer caramel or nut flavors to this, but it's a pretty distinct chocolate cinnamon roll.  Maybe add some tobacco?\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, 2% seems like mostly bakery cinnamon and texture without much other flavor. 4% has a clearer chocolate flavor shot through the entire vape. Cinnamon doesn't seem much heavier and the the texture feels a bit more like an actual baked good. 6% has a sharper inhale, chocolate feels a bit more filled out. Bakery cinnamon still feels pretty well in balance. Texture is still soft, but it has some actual flavor attached. The inhale at 8% feels a bit too sharp, chocolate has filled out nicely and is taking over any of the cinnamon roll underneath it. 10% has a really sharp inhale, probably a better with a long steep but feels almost too heavy on the chocolate.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[The ELR Page. One note from user \"SunnyD\": \"Used at 12% and got a cinnabon taste from the vape. Needs a cream to add a little to it.

A mix of candy cranberry, peach, and pineapple seems like a close enough approximation. I do get some clearer, creamy coconut out of this.

Pretty mellow cranberry top notes first, then a creamier coconut candy. Rough boozy base, with some actual alcohol heat and bite underneath. A touch astringent and seems to leave your mouth a bit raw. Flavorwest's website lists triacetin as an ingredient, and you can feel that whipped cream kind of gelatin-esque stickiness to mouthfeel. Lingering boozy coconut note.  I don't taste much peach here, but you can definitely smell it afterwards, which is a bit weird.\n\n**Off Flavors:** Strong booze bite and astringency. I'm seeing it as more of a feature than a bug, but it's probably a lot stronger than it needs to be to sell this as a tropical cocktail.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light? It's not particularly harsh, but that hotter booze note gets a little weird on the throat. \n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This isn't a good flavor, per se. The fruit notes border on terrible, and that booze note is pretty sharp for solo use.\n\nI'm going to be using this a booze enhancer.  That actual bite and heat does a better job of simulating an actual cocktail than anything else I've run into. The non-distinct fruitiness is going to be a problem, but should blend in fairly well with juicy, more authentic fruit flavors. This may be the missing link in making umbrella cocktails really pop.  I'm thinking Mai Tais, Daquiris, Pina Colodas, and even margaritas if you have a strong enough lime base.\n\n**Notes:**  S&V Concentration testing, I get a full boozy heat starting at 1%. Light, chalky fruit mix, but primarily just that bite. 2% still has a bite, but you feel this gettig smoother and picking up some of that gelatin emulsification. 3% is getting fairly sharp, and the fruit here is getting a bit more separation, letting you pick up the coconut pretty clear. 4% is a bit more complex, as the bitterness from that boozy note is popping those deeper cranberry notes. 5% is fairly overwhelming, mostly just hot booze and messy, chalky fruit.  I'd start with this at 2% and work up. Your usage is going to vary wildly based on how well that fruit note is blending and how boozy you want your mix.\n\nSo could that authentic alcohol note just be the Ethyl Alcohol in the base? I'm guessing that there is something more than that going on.  Based on [this list](http://juic.org/aroma-volatiles/ethyl-alcohol/) from abdada's juic.org, this is somewhere between 1-5% Ethyl Alcohol. FW Martini is 55-65%, and I didn't get nearly as much of a hot booze note off of that. Same thing with FW Ruby Red Grapefruit at 20-30% or FW Pink Champagne at 10-20%.  [The SDS from Flavorwest confirms that this is between 1-5% ethanol.](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/6pon5hhbk4aasnu/AAAlb_B4drZ2XyTnwsuf_RtTa/SDS?dl=0&preview=Ruby+Relaxer+Flavor+N%26A+FW-RRX.pdf) (Side note, it looks like Flavorwest has all of their SDS sheets up now, which is pretty handy.)\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nNothing that I can find.\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FW Rum, 3 and 6%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 5 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Tastes more like the top notes from butterscotch than anything else.  I could maybe theoretically see this a butter rum flavor because it has a bit of warmth, but I'm not getting the molasses and spice notes from a dark rum or the agricole bite and funk from white rum.  Sweet, but thin and top-heavy.  Back end of the exhale, especially if you're using a higher percentage to chase a full flavor, picks up a subtle fruitiness and sourness that doesn't really sit well with the heavy butterscotch character on the front. There's maybe a tiny bit of boozyness and warmth in here, but it seems to reinforce the butterscotch vibe as opposed to come across as an actual booze note.  It's a weaker flavor without any real body to it, probably better used as an accent for butterscotches and caramels than trying to bludgeon it into an actual rum. I'd crank it up to 6-8% even as an accent.\n\nInhale is warm and thin.  Basically tastes like butterscotch but no real richness or body. Sweet, but no real base to it.  Exhale has more of those butterscotch top notes.  It's not really a rich, actual butterscotch or even a drier caramelized sugar. It's more like smelling a bag of werther's originals. There's a small bit of boozy warmth, and maybe a hint of bite, but it's really subtle next to the butterscotch up front.  Sour fruitiness on the back end of the exhale that starts to stick out quite a bit after 8%.  Airy and thin exhale overall. Sweetness level is okay for a butter rum type of flavor, but it's all living up in those top notes.  Again, no real base to this flavor.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  More of a butter rum than anything else.  There's this weird, subtlety sour fruitiness at higher percentages that seems to be tasting just a hair rancid with that buttery note up front.  It's similar to the fruity note from INW Jamaican Rum but dialed way back and playing off that butterscotch-ish taste to get a bit a weird. \n\n**Throat Hit:**  Not really.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I will continue to fruitlessly try rum concentrates hoping to finally pull of a boozy rum cocktail.  I realize FA Jamaica Rhum is delicious, but it doesn't really have a bite to it and the less said about INW Jamaica Rum and TPA Dark Rum the better.  The rum base from SA Lime Rum probably came the closest, but it had a distinct cheap cologne to it that was kind of gnarly.  This isn't the answer to my rum dreams.\n\nAny booziness in this is pretty subtle, I wouldn't try to use this as a rum and it doesn't quite have the body to use as a butter rum type of flavor solo.\n\nI could see using this punch up a butterscotch flavor or pull a caramel closer to a butterscotch, but honestly I feel like you can get similar results without having to go with a flavor that has such limited use cases.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, this is weak, even for Flavorwest.  At 2% I'm having problems tasting much besides maybe a light butterscotch type of butter rum flavor.  It's all top notes, and it's really light. At 4%, still coming across as light. No more body, no more presence. At 6% still just top notes, but their starting to fill out a bit at least. At 8%, those top notes are at least present.  I'm getting a bit more pronounced warmth but nothing really approaching boozy. Weird sourness and fruity note showing up a bit on the back end. At 10%, still no real base. Sourness is a bit heavier. Starting to taste weird. At 12% it's kind of a getting a bit rancid, but I'm still looking for a full flavor. I'd use this between 6-8% as an accent. Doesn't have the body to carry the whole full flavor thing.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nSo this is apparently one of three flavorwest rums, the other being Jamaican and butter.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FW Salt Water Taffy @ 3% Solo / others noted, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 23 days.\n\n**Flavor Description (Solo):**  Solo, this kind of tastes like a slightly greasy, denser marshamllow.  Actually pretty spot on to a taffy base. Inhale is mostly just sweet with some warmer non-floral vanilla, although it has a building sharpness to it that doesn't really have a flavor attached. Exhale is pretty mellow flavorwise. I get maybe a hint of a vanilla up front more in the top notes, and a deeper hint of a waxy margarine fattyness in the base that comes through on the back end. Mouthfeel is pretty solid though. Like a denser TFA Marshmallow on the bottom end without really spreading through to the top notes.\n \n**Off-flavors (Solo):**  It's probably not the most descriptive, but this tastes a bit muddy to me on the back half of the exhale. Like the flavors here kind of bang into each other a bit and get a light anise tinge which clears itself up by the very tail end of the exhale.  I get the same thing from a lot of Capella flavors in general, which is interesting. It's not an off flavor I usually associate with Flavor West. I don't think it's a dealbreaker by any means, as salt water taffy usually tastes a bit chemical and off anyway. The anise-y part of this shows up in mixes, for sure but that muddyness doesn't seem to carry through.\n\n**Throat Hit (Solo):**  Moderate at the beginning. Flavor \"settles in\" fairly quickly though. Light after after the first couple draws.\n\n**Additive Tests:**\n\n*2% DIYFS Holy Vanilla, 1% FW Salt Water Taffy:* At 1% the Salt Water Taffy is definitely adding a bit of volume, although it seems fairly indistinguishable from adding some marshamllow. Maybe more \"jellied\" like corn syrup than just straight marshmallow fluff.  Seems to prop up the vanilla here while rounding off some of the more delicate floral notes and replacing them with a pretty clear anise. I'm using Holy Vanilla as a stand in for creams and flroals here, and based on these results I'd have to say it largely works, although even 1% seems to be pushing a lot of anise into the equation.  Maybe keep vanilla or creams relatively low as an accent flavor if you're using Salt Water Taffy.\n\n*3% FW Root Berr, 2% FW Salt Water Taffy:*  I get a clear, spicy root beer flavor with a moderate body.  I think something here might be pushing those spice notes from the root beer up a bit in the mix.  The anise-y muddiness here is giving me just a hint of fresh tires.  Also sweetening up the root beer a bit. I don't really pick out any of the flavor from the taffy base, but I\"m definitely picking up some good texture and it seems to be softening the base flavor of the root beer as well.  S&V, seems like it's handling 4% Salt Water Taffy pretty well.  For sharper, sweeter flavors I'd use Salt Water Taffy up at something like 4%.  It's a solid volume, and the composition of the flavor definitely feels like taffy.\n\n*4% OSDIY Blue Raspberry Slush, 3% FW Salt Water Taffy:* Pretty intense. Sweet, Sweet Blue Raspberry. Anise isn't as prevalent under that syrupy candy flavor. A pretty passable version of a blue raspberry taffy, although I find myself wanting just a bit more vanilla and butter here to really pull it off. Getting a hint of watery thiness down low that mucks with the texture a bit. Adding in about .5% TFA Marshmallow really helps sell the taffy effect.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nBased on those additive tests, this isn't bad. I think the limiting factor is going to be that weird spicy anise note.  For brighter flavors, starting at 3% and adding a low percentage of marshmallow seems like a pretty solid starting point. As low as 1%, this starts bringing in some solid texture that isn't nearly as fluffy as something like Marshmallow or as gritty as Meringue.  Maybe start low when using this as a texturizer, and see how far you can push it without picking up the anise spice here.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nSurprisingly sparse.  A couple mentions as a good option for a taffy base, but no real detail.\n\n[Older review dump.  Obviously I feel like 20% would be waaaay overkill for pretty much any setup now, but I concede the point that this can get plastic and artificial with other flavors. I mean, it's salt water taffy (not really known for natural flavor), and I get more anise than plastic, but still a valid point:](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/2h68c7/random_flavor_reviews/)\n\n\"Salt water taffy: to me this was a bust. 20% by itself was ok but I couldn't find anything that mixed well with it.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FW Salty Butter Balls, 2 and 4%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 8 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Flavorwest calls this a \" Salted Chocolate Brownie with Swirled Butterscotch Flavor.\"  I get mostly a sort of metallic, but impressively salty thinner butterscotch flavor bordering on maple.  Seems like it isn't full butterscotch, so much as just difference between caramel and butterscotch, if that makes any sense. Some lighter dry chocolate brownie in there, especially at higher percentages and on the tail end, but that salty butterscotch is pretty dominant.  I'd use this at around 6% as a primary flavor with a brownie accent, 2% with a soft caramel for a salted butterscotch, or maybe around 1% if you just want the salty note for a caramel or whatever.\n\nInhale is sharp and and kind of acidic. It's not like a sour, citric acidic, but has a definite bite to it that kind of leaves your mouth a bit raw. I'm pretty sure that's the salt here. It sort of mimics that bite you get from overseasoned food. Theres some butterscotch notes behind that, but with that salt bite you don't get much body from it.  At higher percentages kind of builds to a commercial maple flavor. Pretty solid sweetness and overall vape is moderately dense but that sting from the salt makes the butterscotch seem a bit thin and metallic. Exhale has that butterscotch almost maple right up front.  I'm getting more salt on the inhale than the exhale, but that salt sting carries through and makes the entire thing lightly metallic.  At high percentages I get a little bit of a softer caramel or butterscotch sauce body but it seems relatively light compared to that salty sting. Salt tails off pretty quickly on the back half of the exhale.  There's some lightly chocolate bakery here, texture doesn't really come in until higher percentages. Sort of a lingering rawness from that salt.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  I get a pretty clear metallic taste from anything going after salty, a lot like what I get from nutty concentrates. This tastes pretty metallic.  I could be wrong, but this feels like it's doing the same thing that [FLV Beer Nuts](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/63k1eo/flv_beer_nuts/) does to pull off \"salty.\"\n\n**Throat Hit:** Moderate. This feels a fairly harsh, and that salty note almost feels a bit acidic.  It's especially noticeable on the inhale.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  If you're chasing the original profile of this concentrate and using this as a primary flavor, CAP Chocolate Fudge Brownie seems like a bit of a no-brainer to support the brownie notes in there. I'd also use a softer caramel flavor, like CAP Caramel or FW Caramel Candy / Salted Caramel (RIP your coils.)\n\nUsing this an accent at a lower percentage, I could see using this to go after a salted caramel or butterscotch flavor. Chocolate level here, at least at 4% and under, seems about like that chocolate note from dulce de leche concentrates so it should be possible to work around.\n\nI think this could also do some interesting things to ry4 style desert tobaccos.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, the salty butterscotch note actually seems pretty consistent through the percentage testing. The brownie on the back end seems to be main thing that changes over 2%.  At 1% i get some of that salty tang and a good bit of sweetness with maybe a light buttery note, but there is very little definition to the flavor. 2% has a bit more definition. Butterscotch is coming through more clearly around that salt. Still not much chocolate taste or brownie texture. 4% tastes like that butterscotch is about as fleshed out as it's going to get.  Salt is still pretty prominent, but doesn't seem all that much more intense than 2%. Chocolate is still pretty light. 6% has a consistent salt note, butterscotch feels about the same. Some light texture on the back end, filling out that brownie a bit. 8% feels a little more acidic and salty, starting to get fairly metallic. Chocolate brownie is coming through moderately well if you're looking for it. Doesn't really jump out. 10% is unpleasantly metallic, at least for me. Not a whole lot more brownie. I'd use this at about 1% to salt up your caramels, 2% as a butterscotch booster, and around 6% as a primary flavor.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Here's the ELR Page. Not much. User \"JoJo\" says: \"5% SnV ok but weak. I think it’s chocolate, PB, and caramel; 1 week good but a little weak. ~3 weeks, same but has potential.  Preferred single flavor mix: 77.0%.\" I'm thinking that was supposed to 7%... 77% seems high even for ELR.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/46443)\n\nHell has frozen over, I disagree that a FW flavor is potent. Quick mentions on reddit [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/3691p5/tfa_butterscotch_advice/crbypvx/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/367ktd/anyone_have_ubadgerfacedcat_s_cereal_recipes/crbn7i7/) about this being potent. I agree that a flavor shows up at sub 1% percentages, but it feels thin and harsh and needs a bit more to flavoring to really get going.  Or maybe my palate is just feeling extra dumb today.\n\n[u/0ptimusRhyme calls it \"a great accent for the buttery notes in any butter toffee/pecan recipe\" in the Pecan FOTW.

Relatively dry herbal flavor, earthy almost musty notes and a molasses sweetness.  It's hard to describe this without mentioning root beer, so it tastes like an herbal version of the sharper note from root beer.\n\nLight, herbal and slightly sour on the Inhale.   Exhale is herbal sassafras.  Dryer musty notes like a natural licorice flavor pushing almost into an oak or cedar.  Similar to horehound. Tastes like bark, but in a really good way.  Sweetness is there, but not overwhelming.  Almost a light molasses or even a real maple syrup sweetness.  Gets a lot more pronounced with extra heat.  Exhale is smooth and moderately dense. Lingering bitterness, with just a bit of a medicinal vibe.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Nothing I wouldn't expect.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Light.  Bitter medicinal vibe on the exhale isn't harsh on the throat but it does sort of anethestize your mouth a bit.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  The obvious one is a more herbal punch in a root beer.  Would take a root beer barrel candy flavor into a more realistic root beer.  Should also be a good main note for building your own root beer with some added mint and vanilla. Using something like FA Oakwood or TFA Red Oak would give you more of a birch beer flavor.\n\nJust mixing this with a spearmint will give you a pretty awesome wintergreen flavor. Especially cool, just because all the wintergreen flavors I've tried have been really weak.\n\nMixes well with TFA Horehound to give you a fuller, sweeter herbal cough drop kind of flavor.  In the same vein, I could see this being used in a licorice or anise candy flavor to give more herbal depth.\n\nMixing at 2% and under will lend a more natural, less HFCS kind of note to colas, dr. pepper, or whatever else kind of dark sodas.\n\nMixing beyond that is going to be interesting, just because this comes off so strongly as \"root beer\" flavor.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nS&V concentration testing, I get mostly molasses at 1% and under, with that bitter finish. Herbal notes are present but indistinct at 2%. 3% starts gets you to root beer, while keeping the balance between molasses and herbal flavors. 4 and 5% push that molasses down into the backend and come across as sort of musty root beer.  Anything above that just starts to come apart.  The actual herbal flavors get a bit too sharp and spicy for me after that. I'd mix this at 4-5% as a primary note in a root beer, just knowing that it'll be a dominant root beer taste.  I'd mix at 2% if you just want that molasses and herbal complexity, and 3% if the hint of root beer isn't going throw your recipe off.\n\nI was a fan of LA Sassafras, but unfortunately that's oil soluble.  This, according the the Flavorwest website FWIW, specifies that it's water soluble.  It's less sharp, and there is quite a bit of molasses here.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nMy googling has come up short of actual reviews of the concentrate.

Relatively heavy toasted note without too much fluffy or sticky marshmallow. Heavier dry graham cracker.  A bit hard to pick out over the toasted part of the marshmallow, but I feel like there is maybe a bit of cinnamon to it.  Chocolate is weak here.  Not really the richer melted milk chocolate thing I'd want from a smore, more powdery and dry.  Seems like a decent base for a smore flavor if you want to go light on the chocolate.  The marshmallow thing should be pretty easy to fix, the chocolate not so much. The ends up tasting pretty toasted and dry at higher percentages, I'd mix around 4%.\n\nInhale is a bit dry and almost spicy from that toasted marshmallow note. Pretty heavy graham cracker grain and texture to it, if maybe just a hair light on graham cracker taste. Seems like there might even be a bit of smoke to that slightly astringent, warm, toasted part of the marshmallow. Some sweetness but not really heavy or sugary. Exhale opens up with some more recognizable graham cracker.  Not a lot of softer marshmallow here, but it does show up, with that toasted top note. Chocolate hits on the end of the exhale.  Drier chocolate kind of disappears into the graham cracker texture. Not really harsh but a bit dry. Lingering slightly chemical toasted marshmallow note.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Balanced more towards dry and toasted, without anything too rich or gooey. Toasted note has a bit of a chemical edge to it, but not too much more aggressive than something like TPA Toasted Marshmallow.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Not really harsh, but a bit dry and sharp.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Needs some more gooeyness, both from the marshmallow and a richer chocolate flavor.  Crazy idea here, but [FLV Smore](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/6awla6/flv_smore/) does the chocolate and the fluffy part of the marshmallow really well.  This does the toasted and the graham.  Combine them and profit?  As a S&V at 4% FW and 1% FLV, this seems like it has some promise.\n\nThis would probably be a pretty decent s'more note for mixing with creams or other bakeries.  It's a bit drier but still conveys a s'more pretty well, so should theoretically let creamier dessert bases do their thing without dragging too much marshmallow to the party.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, this seems a bit stronger than the newer batch of FW flavors. I'm getting a fairly full flavor at 2%.  Not quite as toasted, and the graham cracker texture is a bit soft, but you can pick out all of the components here. 4% is on the dryer side.  More toasted, heavier graham texture. That dry toasted note pushes around the relatively weak marshmallow body and chocolate quite a bit, but it's not a bad tradeoff for texture if you're going to be bolstering those. 6% tastes a little too dry. Toasted note is becoming too aggressive and artificial. 8% has a pretty solid chemical edge to it from the toasting.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nNah, still new.\n\n[Here's the Flavorwest product page.

Drier, chalky and moderately sweet but still kind of airy. Light vanilla flavor bordering on anise-y artificial. That little weird artificial twinge at the end kind of tastes the actual food coloring in sprinkles, so good job there.  Thin and dry in a fairly accurate way. Kind of like a really dry, underflavored marshmallow. As accurate as this is, it isn't really aggressive or distinct enough to stand out in a mix.  Maybe some limited use to add some artificial birthday cake kind of sweetness to a normal cake mix, or some kind of poorman's FA Oba Oba to texturize syrupy fruits.  Pretty undefined under 2%, but this get's unpleasantly dry before it fills out.\n\nInhale is chalky with an airy sweetness. Some really light vanilla in there with a bit of chemical artificial taste in the top notes. Sort of mildly harsh and unsatisfying.  Exhale starts off with that light vanilla, top notes almost turn into a slightly bitter anise kind of flavor.  Dry, chalky texture and that flavor fades out quite a bit on the back half of the exhale. Almost feels like raw vg, even up at higher percentages.  It's like a hint of very dry artificial marshmallow. That dryness lingers for quite a while after vaping. \n\n**Off-flavors:**  This tastes uncannily like eating a mouthfeel of sprinkles, but somehow even less satisfying.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Light to Moderate, mostly from the dryness. It gets really weird when you start chain vaping this.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  An accurate sprinkles flavor, but I'm not sure how to use it. Using it with a heavier cake, you may get some of that weird artificial vanilla / food dye sprinkle note coming through in the top notes, but most of that body is going to be run over by almost any other flavor.  It may be enough to nudge a cake slightly more in a festive birthday cake direction, but it's going to be pretty subtle and subjectively that artificial note isn't really all that fun.\n\nWould probably thin out and texture syrupy fruits, but I feel like Oba Oba already has the market locked down on that and it does a better job.\n\nI realize it's not scientific or anything, but cross dripping this over another flavor, it basically disappears.  It's like a chalkier version of whatever flavor it's being dripped on top of.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, this is really light at .25, .5, 1, and 1.5%.  It's linear in that range, but it's mostly a light chalky mouthfeel and very artifical tasting vanilla. Around 2% you start to really get that artificial \"sprinkle\" note on the vanilla, but the base is still airy, thin, and chalky. 4% is a little sweeter, a little dryer, and a little more artifical tasting. 6% is getting distinctly dry for me. The sweetness is getting fuller, but it's still airy overall.  It's like a crazy dry light marshmallow flavor. Still doesn't taste like a full flavor at 8%, but it sure is dry. 10% is like sweet chalk.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nBrand New!\n\n[Here is the product page.  It is not useful.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FW Star Candy, 2 and 4%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 5 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  The taste of starbursts, if not the texture. A mixed fruit flavor, seems to be based on the classic orange, lemon, cherry, and strawberry starburst lineup.  Solid candy sweetness, with a really interesting tart note.  Seems a bit heavy on the citrus, but there may be more strawberry hiding in here that I can't really taste.  No real starburst texture to this, just kind of syrupy. Sort of like jamming all 4 colors of starbursts in your mouth and just letting them dissolve as opposed to chewing them.  Fairly accurate flavor though.  Seems like a good starting point for your candy vapes.  I'd use this as a primary note around 6%.\n\nInhale is tart and candy citrus heavy. Definitely tastes like the yellow and orange starbursts. Candy sweetness, but a syrupy as opposed to chewy texture. A little harsh and sharp, but that tartness seems dead on to profile. Exhale is has tart lemon right up front with that sweeter orange coming in right after it.  Some higher citrus top notes, but nothing like a citrus zest. Exhale starts to pick up some nuance on the back half as the red and the pink starburst flavor starts to show up. Supposed to be a cherry and strawberry, but just tastes accurately indistinct and \"red.\" No artificial cherry weirdness. Still syrupy sweet as opposed to chewy.  Lingering sugar lips and a bit of rawness from that heavy tart note.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Texture is pretty from starburst, but nothing off in the flavors.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Moderate. That tartness is a bit harsh overall.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Fairly accurate to all of the classic starbursts at least in flavor, just needs some texture.  This should take candy texturizers pretty well. Seems like some CAP Jelly Candy or a small percentage of FLV Candy Roll and some Vanilla Swirl should probably work for some starburstish texture.\n\nThis also tastes fairly close to the artificial fruit mix in skittles, although it would probably need some extra lime and grape to really fill out the whole rainbow.\n\nAlternatively they have those bizarre taco bell starburst slushies. You could totally do that.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, this seems pretty linear. Noticeable down at 2%, but seems a little light and pretty far towards lemon. 4% is quite a bit sweeter, with a little more nuance in that citrus.  Orange is quite a bit clearer here.  The red and pink starburst taste is more of an accent to the citrus. At 6% this feels pretty well balanced. It's pretty strongly sweet and tart, but that seems accurate to profile.  A bit on the harsh side, but the flavor underneath the harshness isn't bad. At 8% that harshness is getting to be a bit much, and the tartness is tasting a little acidic.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nBrand New!\n\n[Here is the product page.  It is not useful.

    "markdown": "Strawberry Lemonade by Flavor West  \n\nA very tart and sweet citrus flavor that is a spot on flavor for a strawberry lemonade. It smells and tastes exactly like a freckle lemonade from Red Robin or Simply Lemonade. The strawberry sneaks beneath the banner of lemon to enhance and bolster the mix as a whole. The lemon is natural and sweet with just the right amount of acidity. This flavor is in no way candy-like, Pledge-y, or Cough syrupy. It's flavor profile is excellent and stands on its own.  \n\nBUT!  \n\nThis flavor is incredibly oily. Upon adding this flavor to VG, the mix will turn cloudy and NEVER turn clear. At any percentage, it will be a pain and nearly impossible to get the flavor solute to dissolve completely into the VG. It is essentially an emulsion like salad dressing. Heating and shaking will dissolve a lot of the flavor but no all of it, especially at percentages >10%.  \n\nGiven that the flavor has a lot of trouble dissolving into VG, the flavor will be incredibly muted when vaping. This is due to the flavor never truly mixing to form a homogeneous mixture. The mixture is at best a colloid. Therefore, I do not recommend this flavor. I went through an entire 10ml bottle trying different %'s trying to make it work but alas could not. I am very sad. I love the flavor...but hate that it seems to be rather unusable with VG. ",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FW Tangerine, 2 and 4%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 8 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  A top heavy tangerine flavor. Solid tangerine zest top notes, which is probably a decent citrus zest because it's less sharp and intense than orange while being substantially sweeter. Not a ton of juicier base to this, but what is there is a sweeter base and it has almost a effervescent, sparkling quality. Sweetness level seems maybe a bit high for a tangerine but it's somewhere in the ballpark of a sweeter tangerine.  Almost has a candy orange taste to overall, but that's sort of what a tangerine tastes like anyway.  Light, waxy warmth to this but substantially less than something like FW Blood Orange.  Moderately to fairly harsh, it's definitely a citrus.  Actually reminds me quite a bit of FW Ruby Red Grapefruit in the way the flavor is constructed.  Seems like a solid choice for a lighter but still realistic choice for the citrus notes in a fruit mix, a sweeter base flavor for a citrus mix, or something to punch up citrus-based beverage mixes.  Useful for zest top notes as low as 1% but fills out and gets sweeter up to about 5%, although the harshness does increase.\n\nInhale is mostly Mandarin zest. Sweeter than a straight orange and a bit less intense, but still pretty realistic.   Fairly heavy building sweetness with a light touch of wax to it. Just a bit on the airy side, but that's not necessarily a bad thing for a citrus. Exhale is sweet tangerine up front, with that pretty heavy zest in the top notes.  Not really juicy or fleshy, but the base of the flavor has a realistic to maybe just a touch oversweet tangerine base.  Base feels pretty bright and lively, and has a bit of carbonation or effervescence effect to it. Decent throat hit on the tail end of this, and those zest notes linger for a while.\n\nFWIW, as far as I can tell Flavorwest just makes the one tangerine flavor, and anything sold as \"Tangerine\" and \"Tangerine (Natural)\" should be the same.  They only seem to officially append the natural thing on their flavors when they have both versions, but this is technically one of the natural ones.  The flavor separates quite a bit, so a more vigorous shake than you're already totally doing with all your flavors (right?) is probably a good idea.  [Also, they have this dispiriting note on the product page: \"Natural citrus flavorings will vary from batch to batch because of the natural aspect of the flavoring, the season of the crop and the raw material that is sourced at the time of manufacture. Also natural citrus flavors can separate when mixed with glycerin and other base materials.\"](http://flavorwest.com/index.php/tangerine.html)  I haven't ordered multiple batches of this, so I can't confirm, but maybe something to watch for.  Their Ruby Red Grapefruit is another natural citrus and doesn't have the same warning, so that's odd.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Nah, not really. I suppose it's pretty zest heavy, but it's an accurate tangerine zest.  Maybe a touch too sweet for an accurate tangerine, but I feel like it's close.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  A bit on the harsh side.  Not terrible for a citrus, but it definitely has a hit to to it.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Seems like a pretty good choice for a sweet tangerine note when you don't want the body of FA Blood Orange or FA Mandarin, or the heavy flat sweetness of CAP Tangerine.\n\nActually seems like a pretty good concentrate for just bringing a light, sweet citrus edge to busier fruit mixes. I could see this working well to add a fairly discrete citrus component in mixes with other heavier fruit flavors.\n\nIf you're a fan of citrus flavors, this actually feels like a fairly good base for a more complicated citrus mix with some tarter citrus like lime or grapefruit.  You're going to need some maltol or ethyl maltol somewhere in the mix to tamp down that throat hit, but it's a pretty solid sweet citrus base that should play well with others.\n\nThis does seem to have a bit of effervescence to it, useful to try to attempt something carbonation-esque with beverage vapes that can stand the orange note.  Could probably be some of the sparkling note for like an orange soda or maybe even a fancy gin drink with citrus.\n\nI also love mandarins with cranberries, but YMMV.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, this is mostly just a light tangerine zest flavor at 1%.  2% has a heavier zest, but there still isn't too much going on in the base. 3% is starting to fill out a bit, I'm getting more sweetness, and a clearer tangerine fruit taste if not the fleshy or juicy texture. 4% is a bit fuller, but still top heavy. Zest is pretty strong this high. At 5% the harshness is really starting to catch up to me, and it maybe feels a bit cloyingly sweet. At 6% this seems too harsh.  I'd use this as a tangerine zest accent at 1-2% and more of a primary note around 4%.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nNot a lot of help out there.\n\n[ELR Page is incredibly thin.

But \"MedicatedDeveloper\" put up a recipe involving FW Tangerine and FW Ruby Red Grapefruit.  When asked about how natural FW Tangerine tastes, they responded: \"More like a tangerine candy or tangerine concentrate (like the frozen juice barrels you get). It's very sweet and very potent. I started out around 1% and slowly moved up with it to give a sweeter grapefruit more like a 50/50 soda or Squirt soda than actual pink grapefruit.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FW Toasted Marshmallow@ %5, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 16 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Just some some slightly nutty toastyness and a fairly neutral sweet volume.  Doesn't seem to have much of a marshmallow kind of flavor underneath. I'm not picking the vanilla that most marshmallow flavors have, and the sweetness level doesn't seem as high as the other marshmallows.  Good mouthfeel, with that volume not having that same kind of dryness you can get out of marshmallows.  A bit weird solo, and can push towards cardboardy at a higher percentage.  As an additive, this is pretty intense and difficult to work with.  Useful at 1% and under to dry out, fluff up, and add a kind of gritty graham cracker texture more than a roasted flavor.\n\nSolo, inhale is dense with a good amount of volume. Not a whole lot of flavor. Dryer toasted top note. Fairly similar to the skin on a golden brown marshmallow with just a hint of a more chemical kind of smoke flavor.  Exhale doesn't have a really have a lot of flavor. Dense, lightly sweet base.  Doesn't have a raw VG taste to it, so it definitely has something going on there though.  Fairly light toasted marshmallow top notes. Starts out a bit nutty, gets a little chemical, and then finishes out with almost a graham cracker kind of cereal note.  Relatively clean finish, without any kind of overtly chemical taste.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Solo, the combination of volume and light flavor tastes a bit flat and grainy over 4%...t he dreaded cardboardy taste, pretty much. Doesn't seem to be an issue when mixed, although that grainy cereal note really comes out in other concentrates.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Nah, crazy smooth solo. Actually pretty cool, less dry and scratchy than other flavors that have this kind of volume.  In a mix, this does tend to try out other concentrates though and will add to throat hit as an additive.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  The big comparison here would be TFA Toasted Marshmallow, and this is worlds different. This is a lot more neutral in flavor, and it doesn't seem to have that weird warming thing that the TFA marshmallow has in spades. On the the plus side, the FW version doesn't have that chemical edge to it that the TFA Version does. So theoretically it should be a better fit for an actual toasted marshmallow, but it really knocks around the other concentrates in a mix. I don't know, I'd give this one a pass but I'm pretty weird about dry vapes and I don't want to have to be dumping a bunch of creamier ingredients into something to counteract the dryness here.\n\n**Notes:**  Talking about concentration, solo this seems to work best at 4% and under. Linear mixer, being noticeable at about 1% and just increasing in volume and (still light) flavor up until 4%.  Starting at 5%, it starts to get that flat cardboard tinge to it. I'm not digging this as a solo.\n\nS&V concentration testing as an additive to DIYFS Holy Vanilla @ 2%, This is noticeable down at .5%.  Seems to be lightening the Vanilla a bit, adding a noticeable amount of volume, and drying out the vape.  Also adding that graham cracker kind of dry, cereal note.  At 1%, volume is pushed up a bit more, vanilla is even more flat and dry, and that graham note is grittier. Seems to be about the useful limit here. I'm getting a whole lot of dryness when mixed over 1%.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nNot a whole lot out there.\n\n[The only substantive thing reviews I can find are on the BCF site, where this is getting pretty good ratings.

Sweet without being sickening, rich authentic toffee flavor, almost like a richly caramelized brown sugar and butter. So very close to a caramel candy. I was pleasantly surprised by a rather prominent toasted nut in this one. I can't place a specific nut, I believe it's mixed nuts. There are faint top notes of a medium vanilla flavor, not as dark as a baking extract, more like a vanilla cream or milk? It helps to add delicious layers to the toffee, making it a very good single flavor candidate. The cream is very light and doesn't provide much body at this 2 week mark, I'm not sure if it will come out more at a longer steep.

I think this will allow for a much more adaptable flavor, add a little cream or ice cream for toffee ice cream (better known as Butter Brickle to some of us older folk, and yes it really reminds me of it). Or coffee and yellow cake for a nice toffee coffee cake with nuts. 12% is a good strength for me on this one for a single flavor, although I've heard some people comment they really like it in the 15-20% range. That might bump the creamy mouth feel as well, but it would be too rich for my subjective tastes, so I would try adding 2-4% more cream, custard, or ice cream first.\n\n&nbsp;",

Steeped: 10 days.  \n\n**Flavor Description:** This is a very pleasant flavor. It reminds me of a dense cake that has been doused in sweetented condensed milk. Fairly thick mouthfeel, you can actually taste the cake in your mouth. Very smooth and creamy. Tres leches has plenty of sweetness on its own. The sweetness reminds me a lot of fw yellow cake it does have corn syrup in it so that explains the type of sweetness I am getting. It is not quite as sickeningly sweet though.  The sweetness is shown throughout but really shines at the finish of the exhale.\n\n**Off Flavors:** None to be had, this is a very authentic flavor. Well, I have never had tres leches but I imagine it is true to its name. Hopefully someone else who has had this dessert can clarify but it tastes how I imagine a tres leches would taste.  \n\n**Throat Hit:** 0/10, This flavor is super smooth and does not irritate the throat at all.  \n\n**Uses:** I can see this being used in decadent dessert vapes. Like maybe a duchess clone *ahem. It would be good to thicken up custard vapes or even be good to add some moistness to bakeries.  This is a very versatile flavor and is a must buy imo.\n\n**Pairings:** Berries, Stone fruits. I see this going very well with caramels and butter-scotches. This flavor is too heavy for most citrus or tropical fruit flavors. I can also see cinnamon working very well with it. It has a somewhat dark sweetness that I believe would also go very well with graham cracker.  \n\n**Notes:** I would definitely use this as a yc replacement in recipes that also have custards or creams in them. I have tried Jungle Flavors yellow cake as well as FLV Pound cake and although both good, they do not compare in flavor (FLV) or mouthfeel (JF) to FW Yellow Cake. If it is supposed to be a dryer bakery recipe this would not work however, due to how creamy and rich this flavor is, it is not a very \"fluffy\" flavoring.  \n\n**Second Opinions:**  \n-  [ELR flavor notes](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/4148)  \n-  Surprisingly, no one on atf has made a recipe public using this flavor, nor are there any notes on it. Maybe this is one of those hidden gems that is underrated?  \n-  [Alisa uses this ingredient just as I would in a sweet cake with caramel and butterscotch](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/recipe/457713/Leche%20Butterlicious)\n##[Other Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I get that burnt butter that I would associate with frying waffle batter but it is way too prominent.\n\nThe weird thing is the aftertaste is really good, after the exhale, and you let your palate rest for a minute. you get waffle covered in maple syrup.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FW Waffle Cone, 2 and 4%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 12 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  The middle ground between a waffle and a waffle cone.  Hot waffle iron flavor.  The sweetness seems really similar to what I was getting from [FW Funnel Cake](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/6q8mrs/fw_funnel_cake/) and [FW Glazed Donut](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/6qfl8h/fw_glazed_donut/) where I'm not sure it's supposed to be an actual maple flavor, but it has a maple edge to it.  Combining that with the waffle iron flavor, you've got a pretty identifiable waffle as opposed to waffle cone. The body here is a bit unsatisfying. It doesn't feel full enough for an actual waffle but it's not crisp enough for a waffle cone.  Doesn't seem to really crisp up all the way, and instead gets cardboard-y and dry at higher percentages.\n\nInhale is dry and sweet.  Seems a bit fluffy and underflavored for a crispier waffle cone. Plenty of volume, but it's getting pretty cardboard-y.  The sweetness here has that weird maple edge to it. Syrupy as opposed to a dryer powdered sugar type of sweetness. Exhale opens with that softer waffle flavor, with some hot iron waffle and maple in the top notes.  Sweetness comes in pretty heavy after that, getting a little dry and harsh. Waffle flavor, but not body fades out towards the back end of the exhale getting pretty bland.  Lingering dryness and some of that light cast-ironish waffle iron flavor.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Kind of misses the profile for a waffle cone with that maple and the less crisp body.  Body tastes kind of soft and thin instead of crispy, bordering on the dreaded cardboard-y.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light, gets a bit dry and harsh at higher percentages.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I'm not sure you're going to get rid of that light maple here, but you may be able to crisp this up a bit with some additional AP.  I'm not sure it's going to really come across as a cohesive flavor, though.  I've never had a lot of success mashing together a cardboard-y flavor and a crisp note into a single flavor.\n\n**Notes:**  At 2%, this feels pretty unsatisfying overall. Sweet, but undefined. Maybe like smelling some making waffles in the next room.  4% is a bit better, I'm getting more fluffy volume out of this, but it still doesn't have a really crisp texture to it. Maple is getting a bit distracting and prominent. At 6% that waffle iron flavor sticks out a bit more.  It's getting dry, but it's the closest to to crisp as this has tasted to me. 8% is dry, and it's getting really cardboard-y. 10% tastes like maple syrup and cardboard.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nNah, still new.\n\n[Here's the Flavorwest product page.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FW Whiskey @ 3%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 14 days\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Cheap whiskey, all the way.  A bit weird and dirty, but manages to get across your favorite bottom shelf whiskey fairly well. Has a bunch of interesting side-effects based on your percentages. Can be used as a dry, spicy, volume at lower percentages.  Good solid sweetness, medium density, interesting stuff.\n\nInhale is sharp and a bit odd, with some slightly cheesy instead of buttery oak in there.  Medium density and a bit of unpleasant sweetness.  Exhale is a lot better, with some higher spicy oak top notes and a warm, albiet cheap, bourbon kind of base. Relatively rich at 3%, with a pretty full density.   Sweetness level is pretty dead on for cheap whiskey, definitely on the sweet side but not sickly or cloying. A deep odd kind of body to this, with a deep,subtle almost sour milk kind of flavor that shows up right on the tail end at higher percentages.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  There's a deep funk here that's not entirely cool. It's not quite buttery, but it has that same kind of heft to it. Almost tastes a bit rancid, but not in a butryic acid kind of way. I think that's the dog food thing that manson was referring to.  It's subtle enough for me to chalk it up to the game here, but it may be an issue for some people.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Nah, pretty smooth.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:** As an actual cocktail vape, I think the primary use of FW Whiskey is to add a more blatant kind of whiskey vibe to a more subtle whiskey like TFA Kentucky Bourbon.  It's won't be a subtle combination, but it'll warm, rich, and definitely taste like a whiskey.\n\nThe richness here would mix well with caramels and butterscotches, although it won't help with any kind of dryness issues. I've found that really rich creams and custards don't work super well, as the deeper funk kind of clashes with any kind of eggy notes from custards.\n\nAt low percentages, I like this in bakeries because the dryness and volume works to boost up a profile a bit without getting your layers soggy.  The lighter spice notes end up drying out your bakeries a bit while helping to pop bakery spices.  ALso has that warming character like TFA Kentucky Bourbon where it helps to warm up your overall vape.\n\n**Notes:**\n  I dig this specifically because it's a bit of a mess.  It has a lot of really odd characteristics based on the percentage you're mixing at. S&V concentration testing, at .25%, this is light but noticable.  Mostly a light oak and a a bit of sweetness. .5% is quite a bit sharper on the inhale. Still oaky, with a bit more of bourbon bite. Fairly dry, but a fairly decent bourbon flavor. 1% has a pretty solid punch, with that oak kicking up a bit and a bit of a burn on the back end. Sweetness level hasn't really changed much from .5%. At 1.5% is starting to pick up that aforementioned funk, getting fairly unpleasant on the back end.  The vape is also drying out a bit.  By 2% this is getting a bit dry and weird. Those off-flavors are definitely picking up quite a bit.  3% has a decent bite to sort of off-set the funk there, but still pretty heavy on the off-flavors. 4% is super warm, with that warming kind of covering up the weirder off flavors. Personally, I'd keep this low unless you really, really want a boozy punch to your juice. I'd start with .5% as an additive for bakeries, and maybe 1% as a whiskey backup for another boozy flavor. If you want a strong whiskey flavor to complement other sweet mixers, maybe start at 3% and work up but watch for those off-flavors.\n\nSo how does this compare to other whiskey concentrates available? Well... i have links.  [Here's my favorite, FLV Bourbon, which is great and oaky, but doesn't have a ton of body.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/5axz0t/flv_bourbon/)  [Here's FA Whisky, which is like a sweeter scotch without much of that oak but with a pretty cool peat flavor.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/5oey1p/fa_whisky/)  [And here's wh1skey's review of TFA Kentucky Bourbon, which is useful but I agree with Wh1skey's initial assessment that it doesn't taste a whole lot like bourbon, opinions apparently differ though.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/4nyw0h/tfa_kentucky_bourbon_flavor_review/)  We don't have a review up for INW Whiskey, but this tastes fairly close to that, although a lot less intense.  I get a rich, kind of funky buttery note from that INW Whiskey that I don't like, and while it's present here, it's a lot further down in the mix and more subtle.\n\nI'm obviously biased, but I like this stuff. It's definitely odd, and not great solo but I think it has some uses and definitely conveys a cheap whiskey better than TFA Kentucky Bourbon solo.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n/u/notcharlesmanson/ thinks this comes across as dry dog food.  I can completely see where he's coming from with that. It's got a good deal of an almost buttery, but not quite funk to it and a weird, messy, dry, spicy note in there that can be a bit kibble-y.  There's also some mentions of cheap whiskey, and I'll 100% support that. This is not a sophisticated whiskey flavor. Bottom shelf all the way.  [This is DoD final judging round where my recipe had FW Whiskey in there, look at 40:20 for a good breakdown of some issues with this flavor.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSj0syf-y6s&t=2867s)\n\nOther than that, not a whole lot of information available.\n\n[There's a quick review by user \"Lastlokean\" on ECF:](https://www.e-cigarette-forum.com/forum/threads/flavor-west-my-experiences.345665/)\n\n\"Pretty Bad by itself, makes an OK whiskey coke. It really doesn't have the 'captain spice' I'm looking for and reminds me more of a light rum. 6/10\"\n\n[This has literally nothing to do with this, but someone really wants to vape whiskey.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FW White Cake, 2 and 4%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 7 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Pretty mellow cake with some light frosting. Pretty good cake texture without a really heavy \"cake\" favor to it. Doesn't really have any richer buttery or eggy notes to it. Not a lot of frosting here, but what is here doesn't have the weird artificial note that their birthday cake did.  I'd use this if I needed a really light cake note to pair up with more delicate flavors.  i'd stay at around 5%, after that it gets a bit dry.\n\nInhale is kind of nondescript. Lighter cake flavor with a fair bit of texture.  I'm getting maybe a light bit of vanilla but it's pretty subtle against that grainier note. A bit of wax from the frosting, but nothing really rich or heavy. Moderately sweet and fairly dense without tasting heavy or rich. Exhale has more of that lighter grain up front. Fluffy rather than dense. Frosting is still pretty light and the sweetness from the frosting note kind of feels like it's bleeding through the entire vape instead of staying put up top. Frosting has a light artificial vanilla,  but fairly waxy. Fairly clean finish overall.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  I think this is pretty accurate to the white cake profile.  It's a light flavor, but white cake is fairly light by itself. Frosting note is a bit thin and flat.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Nah, pretty smooth.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Even if this drops all the questionable stuff from FW Yellow Cake, it doesn't really seem like a satisfying sub.  There is a lot of texture, but not a whole lot actual cake taste here and I don't think it will work in the same applications as yellow cake flavors do. I think pairing this with heavy or aggressive flavors is going to basically bury this.\n\nI'd save this for when you want a lighter delicate cake flavor to pair with more intricate and subtle accents.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing this seems limited mostly by the dryness of that cake note. 2% is light and a little chalky. Kind of has a light raw flour taste to it. 4% tastes a little more cooked and like a (light) cake flavor. Frosting note still seems pretty light though. 6% is getting fairly dry for me, that grainy texture and underflavored cake base gets a bit weird.  Frosting is actually a bit better up here, but that cake base feels a bit cardboard-y. 8% feels way too dry overall and is starting to get some pretty pronounced bitterness.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nIt's a new flavor, so not really.\n\n[Here's the product page from Flavorwest.

    "markdown": "The journey truly began 7 years back, when I first experienced Dream Tea by Mt Baker Vapor. Fast forward to 2018 when I got into DIY, my first clone attempt was Hawk Sauce, which was fairly simple, but I definitely wanted to replicate my old favorite. I ended up trying a lot of different things and gave up on the original, instead going for my own peach green tea recipe, [Shinto](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/122804#shinto_by_selev).\n\nLast week I checked MtBakerVapor to see if they still sold it, but I learned from their chat support that it was discontinued. I ended up sending an email asking if it was possible to get the recipe, and got this response:\n\n> You have been on quite an adventure working on replicating this flavor. I was able to find the recipe but it is on a document from 2013 when we were not the most scientific group of guys. So things were measured in units of the tools we used back then. All the sheet showed me was a 2 next to each flavor name. So equal parts of each flavor. Flavorwest flavorings you typically want to go 15-20% flavoring to base ratio. \n\n> You are going to want equal parts of: Dragon Fruit, Mango, and White Tea. \nhttps://www.flavorwest.com/water-soluble-flavoring/dragon-fruit.html\nhttps://www.flavorwest.com/mango-natural.html\nhttps://www.flavorwest.com/white-tea.html\n\n> This should get you close. I know later in history we recreated it with another flavor manufacturer. I do not remember if we made any tweaks at that time or not. This should get you off to a close start in recreating that old favorite of yours. \n\n> We appreciate all the support. We have been exploring doing limited runs of some of the old favorites but nothing is concrete yet. \n\n> I hope I was able to help a bit.\n\nThere were next to no reviews to see for FW White Tea, surprisingly. It had been around this long and no reviews? So, here's my first flavor review for the compendium.\n\n---------------------------------\n\nSetup: Falcon 2 on an Aegis Legend at 46W\n\nPG/VG: 65/35\n\nTested at 0.5%, 1%, 1.5%, and 2%, steeped 1 day.\n\nDescription: Soft, white tea flavor with gentle floral notes of honeysuckle and elderflower, and noticeable honey sweetness. \n\n0.5%: Throat hit 1/10, like a very neutral tea, very fluffy, just slightly sweet but in a very natural, herbal fashion (honeysuckle?)\n\n1%: Getting clear notes of honey in the tea. 2/10 throat hit. This is a good spot for a primary or secondary in a recipe.\n\n1.5%: The perfect sweet spot for a prime flavor in the recipe. Just enough tea, floral notes, honey sweetness, 2/10 throat hit. \n\n2%: Now about 3/10 throat hit, pronounced honey notes, still enjoyable but very faint yet noticeable off-notes of metal/cardboard. Do not pass.\n\nPairings: Citrus, creams, florals, menthol. Imagine there's other amazing uses one could do with it. I feel that it could take on a neutral tea base for any recipe.\n\nYou'll probably see me post soon in the future with a Dream Tea clone.",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FW Wild Berry Cobbler, 2 and 4%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 13 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Accurate to profile, a berry cobbler. I get warm, dark, and jammy berries up front.  Berries taste closer to darker blackberries rather than something brighter like a raspberry, but they have a definite cooked, syrupy edge to them.  The cobbler in here is a little lighter and comes through mostly on the back of the exhale. Softer bakery note, tastes a little toasted but still pretty soft and soaked in that dark berry. Really solid flavor overall, and I think it pushes pretty close to a single flavor, especially at higher percentages.  Could maybe take a bit more of a soft bakery note to boost the cobbler part of this, and I wouldn't argue with some light bakery spice.  Could also go well with some whipped or ice cream.  I'd mix with this around 6% as a primary note.\n\nInhale is pretty heavy on the berries. Dark, jammy berries with a moderate but profile appropriate sweetness. It's odd, I don't really taste florals here, but I get some of that sharpness on the inhale I associate with floral notes. Berries carry through on the exhale.  Sweet, jammy black(ish)berries with a cooked warmth to them. Some more of that odd phantom floral sharpness in the top notes, but I still don't actually taste anything perfumey here. Cobbler comes through a bit clearer on the back half of the exhale. It's relatively subtle and soft, but there is some warm grain to this with maybe a hint of butter.  Almost like the muffin around the blueberries in a blueberry muffin or a legit cobbler. Beyond that sharpness, I'm not getting much in the way of throat hit, and while this is sweet it's pretty retrained. Some lingering pectin-y stickiness and and some of that cobbler bakery in the top notes.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  I don't taste florals here, but I feel them.  There is a sharpness to the way the flavor hits that doesn't really work with those warm, softer, sweet flavors. \n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light.  That sharpness isn't really a throat hit, but it keeps this from being 100% smooth.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This is really close to a single flavor. It's pretty well balanced as is.  I'm not the \"sweetener guy\" but this seems like it would be good to go with a little bit of your sweetener of your choice to soften that sharpness a bit and really saturate your palate.\n\nIf you did want to bolster this a bit, the cobbler is maybe just a bit on the light side.  A softer bakery like CAP Sugar Cookie may work to build up that cobbler a bit without any additional sharpness from a more AP forward bakery.  I also think this could stand a light touch of some cinnamon to it.\n\nIn terms of additions, this seems like a good candidate for some a la mode, with some ice cream or whipped cream. You could also add a whole bunch more creams and go for something like a blackberry cobbler milkshake.\n\n**Notes:**  This seems like the cobbler part takes a bit of a steep to come out. 2% seems a bit light. Nothing weird about it, just feels like the flavor is a bit turned down. 4% is starting to feel fairly full. Cobbler bakery is coming through a bit clearer and feels just a bit richer. 6% fresh is tasting a bit sharp, but judging from the steep at 4% should settle in pretty nicely. Berry is a bit fuller and the bakery that I am getting seems pretty solid. I'm starting to taste, as opposed to just feel, the florals at 8% and the bakery cobbler doesn't seem much better than 6%.  I'd probably stop at around 6% with this, although a longer steep and more creams would probably let you push it a bit higher.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nNah, still new.\n\n[Here's the Flavorwest product page.

( this could also just be the ginger it can take on citrus note depending on where it is grown )There is probably a little nutmeg in there as well considering that this is traditional but I'm not picking it up.    \n\n**Relatable Flavors** \n\nThis tastes like a sweet dessert wine with plenty of extras to give it character. \n\n**Position In The Recipe** \n\nBase or top note. This flavore should be easy to build on, and the spices are really going to take the top note in most recipes.\n\n**Pairings** \n\nMost citrus fruits in particular tropical and orange will pair nicely, also thinking that a mint will really bring this flavoring to life. Should also play nicely with tobacco's and dessert flavorings such as cake.\n\n**Recipe**\n\nhttps://alltheflavors.com/recipes/7027\n\n**Notes**\n\nThis is a pretty fantastic standalone flavoring with plenty of punch at 5%. Was hoping for more of a dark red wine not a big fan of sweet wines, may need to pick up something bitter to push it to that dry dark red wine place.           \n\nhttp://www.vaperstek.org/mulled-wine-aroma-flavor/            \n                            \n**Rating** 85/100                \n\n*Please if your opinion differs, or you have another review for this post it in the comments.

Not at all unpleasant just unexpected.\n\n**Position In The Recipe**\n\n 5% should make a fantastic candy base . Lower percentages should accent other candies such as butterscotch or caramel, and  take the top note position in any ice cream or creamy recipe.    \n\n**Pairings** \n\nOther candies, bakeries, tobacco's, creams, dark berries, and vanilla's.   \n\n**Notes** \n\nI pick this one up from Vaporstek one of the most highly rated flavorings on their website, thought it was an interesting profile. I think this could easily replace caramel or butterscotch and almost any recipe with little or no change to percentages.  \n\n\nhttp://www.vaperstek.org/toffee-aroma-flavor/\n\nhttps://sites.duke.edu/dukeresearch/2013/01/23/cooking-up-chemistry-with-candy/\n\n**Rating** 95/100\n\n*Please if your opinion differs, or you have another review for this post it in the comments.

Until today, the only watermelon I've been able to handle is from a commercial juice company made by the grand master /u/frock_donghammer. There's nothing really special going on here but the flavor hits the mark as far as what I would expect. Scrap any thoughts of a fresh watermelon and think candy. Normally, I'd oppose a candy based flavor but the way this comes through is fantastic. Remember the watermelon Jolly ranchers? Well this watermelon hits that exact flavor almost perfectly. It is smooth and full flavor at 3% but I did start to pick up some harsher notes on the 6% mix, sort of a dry burn sensation that I'd normally get from any Watermelon. So keeping this lower on the scale is a must for myself but as with any flavor, everyone is different so experiment for yourself. Overall, well done Watermelon that I am looking forward to playing with further.\n\n**Off Flavors**\n\n*Like I said, on the higher side of mix percentage I picked up a bit of a chemical burn that was noticeably harsh,on the lower side it was gone and overall very smooth*\n\n**Possible Pairings**\n\n*I think solo at 2-3% it would make a nice straight watermelon flavor, maybe a touch of Sweetener to give it some Pzazz. In a mix I'd say toss it down to 0.75-1.5% depending on how much pop you're going for. I tossed this together with Great Lakes Blueberry and Great Lakes Cheesecake and it turned out pretty interesting,the Blueberry watermelon combo is real nice and the Cheesecake provided a bit of a smoother, creamier feeling*",

    "markdown": "**Flavor description from Health Cabin:** *Strawberry tree, Panama · Berry, Jamaica · cherry, Buddie · tree, Singapore · Cherry, etc. have aliases such as those close to cherries in Japan* \n\n**Percentages Tested:** 0.5%, 1%, 2%, and 3% (two day steeps for all)\n\n**Testing Setup:** SXMini Faucon RDTA with a four-wrap SS316L single clapton clocking in at 0.35 ohms @ 30 watts.\n\nPersonally, I've never actually tried kerson fruit, so I definitely can't speak to this flavor's authenticity. After doing a little research, it seems like it's supposed to be similar to a cherry, and some even say it tastes like [cotton candy](http://tastylandscape.com/2013/04/26/aratiles-tree-cultivating-the-cotton-candy-flavored-fruit/).\n\n**0.5%:** \n\nThe overall flavor is very faint, but there's a notable, generic sweetness. Not a distinct cherry flavor at this percentage, but I can understand why this is sometimes called \"cotton candy fruit.\" It feels like I'm on the verge of getting a fruit snack type of flavor, and it seems like it would get juicier if pushed higher. Really too light here to provide much in the way of flavor, but could be used at this percentage to help sweeten berries or other fruits. No distinct or noticeable off-notes.\n\n**1%:**\n\nThis becomes a bit artificial-tasting, but not necessarily candy. We're definitely entering a cherry-like territory here. It's more reminiscent of a cherry juice than it is an actual cherry, and it's juicy property is a lot more noticeable. Still very sweet. It has decent mouthfeel for a lighter fruit flavor without being jammy or cloyingly sweet. The overall flavor is light enough at this percent where its flavor would probably be overpowered but its sweetness and juiciness wouldn't be.\n\n**2%:**\n\nIt seems like the flavor really opens up here. The juicy sweetness sits very far upfront, and there's a very, very slight bitterness/astringency in the backseat. It reminds me of a cherry version of TPA Raspberry Sweet. This is very much a sweet cherry flavor rather than a tart, fleshy one. It has the canned cherry taste without the jammy density and stickiness. At this percent, it's like the flavor is trying to be a jam, but it just doesn't have the heavier weight to throw around. This makes me think something like FLV Boysenberry could really nudge it in the proper direction. I still wouldn't call this a candy cherry, but it would do great in that type of profile. It's a solid middle note at this level- not quite bright enough to be a powerful accent and not potent or heavy enough to act as a sturdy base.\n\n**3%:**\n\nDoesn't change much at all from 2% (maybe the flavor is a hair stronger than previously), but the astringency is easy to pick up on at this percent. I don't think it's bad enough to ruin a mix, but it might need something to cover it up. While the flavor doesn't change much, it manages to get just a little it sweeter. Almost too sweet (maybe that's what's causing the almost bitter aftertaste?).\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\nThis flavor offers a decent artificial, sweet cherry note that will shine the most when used with other fruits. It'd be great in beverages, and with enough support, I could see this being used in certain bakeries. I think some people might find the sweetness a little cloying, and for this same reason, I'm not sure it's the best candidate to pair with anything dairy. Personally, I'd also avoid anything spiced and probably tobaccos, too. Overall, it's a solid middle note. You know how a lot of people use TPA Marshmallow to round out sharp edges? This could fill that same role in a fruit profile with sharp edges without sacrificing juiciness and without muting nuances. Frankly, I'm just relieved that I didn't pick up any sort of medicinal note, but there is definitely an astringency starting at around 2% of which you should be aware.\n\n\n\n\n",

    "markdown": "**Setup:** Recoil w/ flavor barrel, Dual 15 wrap 26g 3mm Nifethal 70 coils @.17 ohms.  60w power, 450F temp limit. Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** HS Apple Mix @ 3%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 31 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Instant apple cider from a packet, all the way. Some cranberry and cinnamon notes, but overall the effect is dead on for a rehydrated powdered apple cider down to the warm and thin mouthfeel.\n\nInhale is warm cinnamon and some nondescript apple. Cinnamon itself is nice and doesn't have that weird sour metallic note from something like CAP's Cinnamon Danish Swirl. More like a very mellow version of FA Cinnamon Ceylon.  Apple has that really basic dehydrated apple taste. No real juice or flesh here. Exhale starts with that apple note then a really mild cranberry type of tartness. Cinnamon shows up again on the tail end of the exhale, with a star anise inflection. Overall exhale is fairly thin without being astringent and dry without being too powdery. \n\n**Off-flavors:** None. Dead ringer for instant apple cider.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Moderate. Right off the bat it's pretty intense. Settles down a bit with extended use but never gets too smooth.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  So this is used in a couple of DIY-famous cider recipes, and with good reason.  It's the main component of /u/fizzmustard/ 's [Mustard Cider](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/3m3avb/mustard_cider_just_in_time_for_the_autumnal/) and /u/skiddlzninja/ 's [Arbor](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/22377#arbor_by_skiddlzninja). It's the obvious use in the best possible way.\n\nThe relative softness of the apple and the pleasant use would lend itself to a cider donut. This is fairly dry, so I'd watch the moistness in the recipe, but this should impart just the right level of fruit and spice to bump up a standard donut recipe.\n\nThe dehyrdrated apple part of this also makes think of mixing with a tobacco. It should give you a fruity essence without making the tobacco too juicy or adding too much spice.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nS&V concentration testing, I like this as a mixer around 2%.  You still get most of the actual flavor available, but the dryness isn't too pronouned. As a primary note, for a cider, 3 or 4% is the way to go. 3% is a little more subtle, with 4% bringing a heavier cinnamon and a distinct sweetness.  This by itself is complex and full enough to work as a pretty damn good cider at 3%.\n\nFigured that a solid review of this concentrate would help, given that we are pretty much past the holiday vape season and everyone (myself included) can go back to forgetting this exists for the next 10 months.  Really great, if really specific flavor.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[I know I linked already, but /u/fizzmustard provides an awesome description in his recipe notes:](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/3m3avb/mustard_cider_just_in_time_for_the_autumnal/) \n\n\"...it's a very clean and bright mix of tart apple, cranberry and a subtle bit of cinnamon spice. The marquee feature here is balance. None of the notes wash out the others and each is distinct and at the appropriate potency. It doesn't SMACK you in the face with apple...just like a cider shouldn't.\"\n\nMost of the other mentions are just people complaining it's sold out. Some discussion of a cider base [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/3n3i54/community_thinktank_apple_cider/)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**\n\nEDIT: I knew I had seen this in a donut recipe. /u/trevorxgage includes it his [\"Thankful Donut\" recipe.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/583wf0/recipe_thankful_donut_and_a_new_donut_base/) His notes are also worth reading: \"This flavor is one of the best fall flavors I've used. It's not really an apple mix, so much as a fall spice mix. Notes of apple, cinnamon, cranberry, and perhaps some other spices, maybe nutmeg?\"",

Aromatics are tobaccos that have toppings like cherry, vanilla, liquorice, etc.\n- This will blend very well in aromatic pipe tobacco mixes.\n- I prefer non-aromatic tobaccos so I won't be reaching for this often unless using it at very low percents. If you enjoy a bit of sweetness in your leaf, this could make for an interesting ingredient.\n- To be clear, it's not sweet like EM or Sucralose. It's sweet because of the molasses note.\n- If I was trying to clone Halo's Torque 56, I would definitely try putting this in there. Actually, when I think of tobaccos like Torque 56, this flavor starts to make a lot of sense.",

    "markdown": "##**HS Australian Chocolate**##\n\n*Summary*  \nAgain, thanks to /u/Vurve for finding this gem. To me, this is a nice, smooth, somewhat sweet, dark chocolate. It's got a great flavor, but if you bring it too high, it's going to get dry and a little funky, so I think this works best as an accent to other chocolates or to give just a touch of cocoa to a mix. It is quite nice by itself, but then it's just chocolate and can be a little boring. I don't find it to be grainy necessarily, but it does have a bit of texture like you would expect from a dark chocolate. Overall, I think this is quite a nice flavoring, but I don't feel it will work as a solo chocolate for a full chocolate flavor. This is a fairly concentrated flavoring, so start low.\n\n**On the Nose**  \nCocoa\n\n**Recommended Usage**  \n*Stand alone*: 1%\n\n*In a mix*: 0.25%-0.75% \n\n**Throat**  \nMild\n\n**Ideal Pairings**  \nOther chocolates, cream, coffee, tobacco, berries.\n\n**Steep**  \nGive this one a good 3-5 days to homogenize.\n\n**Recipe Idea: [Thin Mint](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/8207)**  \n*Ratio: 15PG/85VG*  \n*Steep: 3 days* \n\n**Ingredient**|**%**|\n:--|:--|\nFLV Creme de Menthe|1.75%|\nHS Australian Chocolate|0.5%|\n\nFLV Creme de Menthe is the star here, but I felt to capture the essence of a Thin Mint it needed just a touch more of that chocolate, preferrably a darker chocolate that's slightly crisp, hence the HS Australian Chocolate.  \n\n*Please if your opinion differs, or you have another review for this post it in the comments.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** HS Banana 1.25% 70/30 VG/PG, Steeped 2 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Banana, something between a candy like banana and banana taste that you find in baked goods. \nInhale and the actual smell of it is similar to LA banana cream, I get that banana runts vibe. The actual top notes remind me of banana peel and the flavor is very ‘soft’ giving a realistic banana mouth feel. What this reminds me of most is a baked banana, this is very spot on, delicate bakery banana flavor.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Anything above 2% and  I start getting a sharp alcohol/perfume like notes. This flavor is pretty strong and I saw on bullcity that the reviewer said he only needed .5-.75% to give his recipe a more authentic banana flavor, I find that at 1% it shows up perfectly in the mixes I have tried. \n\n**Throat Hit:** Light. Nothing really 1/10\n\n**Uses & Pairings:** Other fruits like strawberry, apple, or anything you like with banana. The definite pairing for me here is bakery or creams. This would work with brown sugars, nuts, caramels, definitely ice creams and all your other treats. \n\n**Notes:**\nS&V definitely more candy like slightly floral but this flavor quickly ages into a creamy semi real banana. \nMy favorite thing about this flavor is that its balanced and has a creaminess on its own. Definitely reminds me of LA banana cream but if someone held freshly peeled banana nearby, it hits a lot of the right banana notes. I am not a huge fan of banana vapes but I make a lot of things for other people and I have found this Banana to work in many applications… here is one of my favorites:\n\n**Banana Nut Bread**\n\n        1 \t(HS) Banana\n\n\t1\t(LA) Banana Cream\n\n\t1\t(TPA) Brown Sugar\n\n\t3\t(TPA) Cheesecake (graham Crust)\n\n\t0.5\t(FA) Cookie\n\n\t0.45\t(FA) Hazel Grove (hazelnut)\n\n\t3\t(TPA) Pistachio\n\n\t1.5\t(CAP) Sugar Cookie\n\nhttps://alltheflavors.com/recipes/24818#banana_nut_bread_by_vdevil\n\n**Second Opinions:**\nOne review on bull city saying how [potent and realistic it is](http://www.bullcityflavors.com/banana-hs/)\n\nCouple notes on ELR about how potent and realistic it is, also mentions [perfume and banana peel notes.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/14232)\n\nNot much on this sub about it but /u/CheebaSteeba used it in a good looking recipe [here](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/recipe/603504/Butterscotch%20Banana%20Frozen%20Custard)\n\n[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)\n\nEdit: removed a word",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** HS Beer @ 3%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 15 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Moderately sweet lightly roasted malted grain with a strong brandy like booziness to it.  Straight malt liquor. A malted base or fermented grape flavor to build on.  Solo, this is a lot like vaping a warm tall can of Steel Reserve.\n\nInhale is sour, with almost lambic hints of dark berries. Exhale is again slightly sour, with a moderate amount of lightly roasted malted grain.  It's definitely lightly roasted, like a blonde or pale.  I get just a subtle hint of caramel, unlike something deeper like an amber or even a stout.  Not really nutty enough for a straight barley, more like a corn blend that you get from macro beers.  The \"fermented\" part here is prominent and boozy, tasting a good deal like a brandy instead of a corn mash type of whiskey flavor with some white grape or deep apple notes to it.  I don't get any yeasty or piney hop notes here.  The dirtier fermentation and brandy notes start to drag this into malt liquor territory.  Builds into steel reserve on your palate pretty quick.  You get that brandy funk and sweatiness sticking around for a bit.  Moderate density vapor.  Sweetness feels pretty natural throughout the exhale, but it again makes you think of malt liquor.\n\n**Off-flavors:** No plastic or rubber notes, no pronounced \"chemical\" notes, or anything outright out of place.  Not too sure what else to call an off flavor here.\n\n**Throat Hit:** None? It feels weird to say, but this pretty smooth.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:** So, you're going to have to think outside the box here.\n\nSince there is no hops or other bitterness, I'd reccomend FLV Yakima Hopps if you want a fuller beer flavor.  You're also going to need something for some juiciness and water down that brandy funk, so a small percentage of CAP Cucumber or INW Cactus. Sweetness might be an issue, so FA Bitter Wizard is going to be your friend.\n\nPeople have also been cramming fruit in beers forever.  Dark berries are pretty common. Citruses are also way up there.  You then have radlers/shandies that are beer mixes with juices (especially lemonade) or ginger ale.  The brandy notes here take me more in the berry direction, but you could pull off citrus if you balanced it right.  In the same vein, people also add a lot of spices and florals into beers.  Since those tend to be pretty aggresive concentrates, balancing the recipe will be an issue. \n\nFermented malt flavor and brandy would probably be better in hard cider flavors.  FA Fuji/JF Fuji or even better FLV Apple Cider with this would take you most of the way to a boozy apple cider.\n\nThe roasted malt with aggressive brandy overtones could also have some use in more savory bakeries, although we are talking small percentages here and someone much smarter than me to figure it out.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nSo the concentration here is going to be key.  At .5-1% you get most of the malt with just a bit of than brandy note.  That hint of the brandy note is kind of thin and astringent though, so it almost comes across as cheaper and gnarlier tasting.  2% is right about the sweet spot, where that malt is still there, and the booze comes across as something more like a high abv slightly syrupy darker beer, as opposed to straight malt liquor or cheap beer.  3% or over will literally make you homeless.\n\nSo, novelty value aside, this is still pretty odd. I can't think of any other concentrates going after this profile and so it's kind of the only game in town. It's definitely not a good beer concentrate on it's own, but it may have some use if you are commited to chasing the specific profile.  Just expect to do a lot of work with it to get the good stuff out of it without crossing into tall cans and regret territory.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nNope.  Some talk about beer vapes [here,](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/5an802/alebeer_flavourings/) [here,](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/2sg2oj/looking_to_create_a_thorough_collection_of_craft/) and [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/4i2g54/where_can_i_find_a_flavor_that_tastes_like_beer/)\n\n[One note on ELR.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/59824)\n\n[And one review for the finished liquid on Fasttech.](https://www.fasttech.com/product/3671200-hangsen-e-liquid-for-electronic-cigarette-30ml)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

I feel like this is never going to be a main ingredient in any of my mixes, but I could see it being useful in a tobacco mix to bring a unique sweetness without detracting from the tobacco profile. There is an almost bready quality to this that is difficult to place. /u/ConcreteRiver, I think this might make it into a sexy, sexy Italian fruitcake recipe! \n\nOff flavors:This has a very funky smell (like wet dogs rolled in a grass pile left outside to rot) but it doesn't seem to be tasteable, and it goes away after the bottle is opened a couple times. If you were expecting tobacco then the sweet, bready, dried fruits are an off taste.\n\nThroat hit: pretty mild even in a 50/50 mix, the smell kinda stings the nostrils\n\nUses and pairings: unique sweetener in tobacco mixes, dried fruit accent in bakeries, Ry4s, and possibly other uses (none come to mind)\n\nNotes: I think that 3% is a bit low for a standalone but perfect for use in a mix, I wouldn't go lower than 2% as this seems rather weak. I could see this being used up to 7% if you wanted to try something crazy. \n\nEdit: /u/chemicalburnvictim is doing a test at 5% and I'm hoping he will chime in on this thread",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Hangsen Ginger @ %2, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 17 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** A spicy ginger flavor with a slightly syrupy neutral base. Definitely warm, moderately dense.  About halfway between a bakery dried ginger and a crystalized ginger candy flavor.  Warmth gets more pronounced on the exhale and is pretty consistent throughout.  Nothing too weird or complex, just ginger.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Nah. Has some syrupy body there, but it's pretty neutral.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Not really. I mean, it's ginger so there's some definite heat and spice there, especially on the exhale.  But... ginger, so that's kind of what you're going for.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:** Pretty versatile stuff. Should work damn near anywhere you want some ginger.\n\nGood way of getting ginger into your bakeries without dealing with all that holiday spice baggage.\n\nPairs well with fruits, especially apple, pears, and peaches.  Also works with citruses.\n\nPretty good potential for candies, tea, cocktails. The world is your gingery oyster.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nS&V Concentration testing, .5% gives you a nice little kick of ginger without much of that sweet body. 1% has a bit more spice, but nothing crazy. Mostly an increase in the sweet body of the concentrate. 1.5% is pushing ginger candy but no drastic ramp up of the spiciness. 2% is starting to get sweet, and that actually seems like it tempering that spice a bit.  3% is still spicy, but it's reading a lot like a ginger hard candy.  I'd start at .5% in a mix for bakeries or any other mix where you just want a touch of ginger spiciness. Bump it to 1.5% if you want some sweetness as well as ginger for a fruit mix. Go all the way to 3% for a ginger candy base.\n\nNot as strong as I expected.  Mixed this tester at 2% fully ready to cut it way back so it didn't blow my sinuses out. It did not.  Seems to lose just a bit of the punch on the steep.\n\nA really nice suprise. Just a ginger flavor, pretty cool.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nNah, not that I can find.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** HS Grape @ 2%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 6 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  A front-loaded grape candy bordering on dimetapp or grape chewable aspirin. Dense up front, light in the back with a chalky mouth-feel.  Like a reverse mullet, with a chalky mouth feel.\n\nInhale is syrupy-sweet, dense artificial grape. Mouthfeel borders on sticky. Exhale is a candy grape base note, with some bitter medicinal top notes. Mouthfeel is less dense than you'd expect from the inhale, and overall gets a bit chalky toward the end.  Relatively clean finish for something that starts this syrupy.  Flavor here is totally front-loaded, which is a bit weird. Exhale is nowhere near as sweet as the inhale.  Grape flavor also feels fairly desaturated in the exhale.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Chewable grape aspirin. Little chalky, and definitely medicinal.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Light. Little harsh around the edges, but nothing major.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Definitely a candy flavor. Sweet and a bit chalky. The one thing that excites me about mixing with this is the actual structure of the flavor.  The front-loaded nature of the concentrate is going to let you start the inhale mega-sweet and keep it going through the exhale with other candy fruit concentrates.  Pairing TFA Raspberry Sweet or INW Strawberry Shisha with this is going to be super sweet, but structured really well to hold a fairly consistent sweetness through the entire vape.\n\nThe chalky thing would be great for anything trying to emulate that kind of mouthfeel.  So like, sweet-tarts or something like that.  \n\nI'd avoid this for your grape-drank flavor, just because that medicinal notes are going to be a bummer... unless you want to go full sizzurp. I'd pair with a handful of vicodin for authenticity.\n\n**Notes:**\nS&V concentration tasting, this seems pretty linear. Flavor is just way less saturated at .5%. Starts to get a bit medicinal at 1.5%, although it still seems a bit thin. 2% is a solid percentage for a single flavor. At 3%, the grape actually seems to take a back seat to that medicinal flavor and it almost starts to take on a koolada type chill.  I'd mix this between 1.5% for a less descript candy grape mixer, and 2.5% for that sweeter, sticky grape candy flavor.\n\nSo personally, I'm not seeing a lot of need for this flavor. [SC Grape is already an awesome grape candy flavor](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/5dps5v/super_concentrated_grape/) and [FLV Grape has the grape kool-aid market cornered.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CloudCollective/comments/4j81r7/grape_flv/)  Maybe if you're after that powdery thing or the weird structure give it a shot, but it's pretty hard to recommend in general.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nAgain, not a lot of documentation on most of the the hangsen flavors.\n\n/u/contactclosure/ did leave a comment in a post on grape standalones [here:](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/3wjf6c/i_need_a_good_grape_or_a_grape_base/) \"Hangsen Grape is the best I've tried. INW Grapes helps round it out. Try 3% HS and 1% INW for starters. Lots of things mix well with that pair. Strawberry, apple, lime etc.\"  Actually, /u/contactclosure/ is the only person I've found talking about this concentrate on the sub.  Found about 3 references, so it's save to say that at least someone is more positive on this than I am.\n\n[Quick mention in the comments for this post on ECF. user michaelsil1 calls it okay, nothing special.](https://www.e-cigarette-forum.com/forum/threads/chasing-that-perfect-grape-i-need-some-help.510296/)\n\nLots of weird hangsen e-liquid reviews from british people on youtube. [Don't watch this because it's damn near useless, but WiltshireVape says it tastes like grape fanta.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN-NrCFPX8k) It's the finished liquid and not the concentrate, but I can't imagine it being more complex than like 15% HS Grape.\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** HS Green Orange @ 3%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 14 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  A full, robust tangerine bordering on orange flavor. Sweet without being overbearing and smooth for a citrus.  Moderate body, and some hints of actual fleshy citrus.  Restrained zest with some hints of lime along with the tangerine.\n\nInhale is mostly building tangerine zest.  Slightly bitter.  Could be the power of suggestion, but it does taste a little green or limey.  Very fresh tasting zest. The zest on inhale has a little orange sweetness sitting under it.  On the exhale, zest stays on the palate but you get slightly fleshy orange or tangerine.  Actual fruit flavor is medium sweet, and lacking some of the acidity you'd expect from a straight orange.  Again, more like a mandarin or tangerine.  Really lightly floral.  Some warm density on the fruit.  That zest lingers for a quite a while, staying a bit bitter but fairly realisitic.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  None.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Tiny bit harsh, but that's mostly the zest on the inhale.  Very little throat hit, especially for a citrus.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:** Mellow enough for both heavy and lighter creams.  Sweet enough for orange or more realistic mandarin candy flavors.  Would go well in sweeter fruit mixes, should blend with both bright and jammy fruits.  Floral notes are restrained enough for blending with small amounts of peaches and pears.  Zest component is relatively restrained, so maybe not a sharp flavor for cocktail vapes.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nS&V concentration testing, I get a sweet tangerine fleshy fruit flavor down at 1%.  Not quite dense enough for a primary note, but it's present and doesn't have a whole lot of zest there.  Zest just ramps up after that. Actual fruit flavor plateaus early, and you are just adding back in that sharper zest above 1%.  About 2% seems to be the sweet spot for the zest before it crosses into a bit bitter and too pronounced.  I'd mix at 1% if you just want the fruit part of this, and 2% if you'd like more of the citrus top notes for a fuller tangerine.\n\nPutting it in context, seems to take the better parts of FA Mandarin and FW Blood Orange and kind of splits the difference.  Quite a bit less harsh than both, and has some of the good full citrus notes of Blood Orange, with that mandarin sweetness.  Doesn't push into full candy like CAP Sweet Tangerine.  And it has some fleshy body and juice to it unlike CAP Juicy Orange or FLV Orange Citrus.\n\nIt's a bit indistinct as a single type of citrus and definitely more on the tangerine side of the fence, but it's a really solid realistic flavor.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nNot a whole lot to go off.\n\n[This is the closest I found to a review.  It's on vaping underground, user rchmx reports \"A nice and realistic tart orange flavor...a bit more just plucked from the tree.\"](http://vapingunderground.com/threads/has-anyone-tried-hangsen-flavor-concentrates-other-than-tobacco.287324/)\n\nSo, with a lack of other information, at least this is interesting.  [I'm guessing this is modeled on the Cam sành or King Orange.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cam_s%C3%A0nh)  Apparently it's closer to a mandarin.  Never tried one, but hybrid citrus is usually pretty damn interesting.\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

A sweeter base, but primarily a floral rose or geranium top note with some green underneath.  The significant other rates this as a 2 of 10 on the \"makes the room smell like cat piss\" scale, which is positive.\n\nInhale almost has a sour honey kind of taste, with some of that deep sweetness but a leafy green kind of sour top note. Exhale really just tastes like flowers. High floral rose/jasmine/geranium kind of top note. Some more of that leafy green kind of flavor underneath that, sort of like FA Jasmine.  Base sweetness is still there, and it could almost taste like honey I guess. Overall, the sweetness just moistens those floral top notes.  Lighter density, not unpleasant if you don't mind florals but this isn't anything close to a full honey flavor.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Not a lot of honey, so most of it?\n\n**Throat Hit:** Nah.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This is tricky.  It's not awful, I just can't think of a ton to do with it besides use it a floral sweetener.  Good to add body to a rose mix. Would work with INW Cactus to actually make it taste more like a cactus.\n\nTop notes here could stand in for like a floral raspberry top note, but I don't think anyone actually tastes a raspberry concentrate and thinks that it just needs to be more floral.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nS&V concentration testing, 1 drop per 10ml gives you about all the sweetness you are going to get out of this. It's a slightly sour sweetness without any kind of richness or body. It's definitely sweet, but I wouldn't call it honey. The floral notes just essentially scale up from there. .25% gets you that identifiable rose and it get's perfumey by .5%.  I'd recommend mixing with this at 1 drop per 10ml if you want to use this as a floral sweetener up to maybe .25% if you really want to push that rose floral note.\n\nIt's interesting, although not tasty stuff.  I've had some raw wildflower honey that has that a tiny bit of that rose top note.  Bees are into wild roses but the processing for honey drives off those really delicate floral top notes pretty quickly. I mean, it's not super unpleasant or anything but I'm a bit stumped about what to do with this. \n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nNot that I can find.\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

I want to say maybe a plum-esque type of fruity. There’s a sweet type of tobacco here, but it’s almost perfume like. The dryness almost makes it feel smoky, but it doesn’t have a smoky taste to it. The perfume like tobacco with the fruitiness almost makes it more floral than anything. Might be an avenue to explore if a slightly floral tobacco sounds like it would tickle your fancy. There are some pyrazines in this bad boy. I think I’m picking up more of the tetramethyl Pyrazine more than the Acetyl Pyrazine. This doesn’t shout single flavor at me, but I think with some clever mixing it could find a place. I don’t get any cocoa, but see the second opinions for more on that. \n\n**Off flavors:** **BUTYRIC ACID WARNING!** The [SDS](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0542/2249/files/Indian_Tobacco-_flavor_essence_MSDS-final.doc?7782485695901594309) can be found on the product page on Nicotine River, and there you will see Isovaleric Acid. A quick google and you can find the [wiki page](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-Methylbutanoic_acid?wprov=sfti1) for this, and it is another name for methylbutyric acid. So if you are sensitive to the vomit/cheese/sweaty feet taste of Butyric acid, maybe pass on this flavor. I usually let my HS tobaccos steep about a month, and I never got the vomit taste from any of the DX or V2 flavors, so I guess it doesn’t bother me. But consider yourself warned! Edit to clarify: methylbutyric acid and Butyric Acid aren’t exactly the same, but if you check out the page on [TheGoodScents](http://www.thegoodscentscompany.com/data/rw1056411.html) you will see that it has a lot of the same odor and flavor properties. So they are like stinky feet brothers. \n\n**Pairings:** I would personally keep this away from dessert and bakery type of things. I’d use this more as a top note in an earthy recipe. I’d use a darker tobacco base, and maybe throw in something kind of woodsy. It’s honestly probably such a niche type of flavor that you’d probably have a better idea on how to use it than I would if the floral perfume like with Butyric acid hasn’t scared you off yet. \n\n**Second Opinions:** Not finding a whole lot. Generic “My favorite!” Review on Vaping Zone. [Couple of reviews]( https://m.banggood.com/Hangsen-Indian-Tobacco-Flavor-Electronic-Cigarette-Tobacco-Tar-Oil-reviews-p90800.html) on this site for the e-liquid that I assume uses this flavor. “Great vapor production!” Kind of tells you that they are pretty old. Had to translate the Spanish review, and it mentions popcorn toast. With all the pyrazines, I could see where they get that, but I don’t personally taste that. /u/RinVapes with a 5 Star review on [ELR](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/12174) with a slight sweetness/cocoa note. Some positive reviews comparing it to an analog on [BCF.](https://www.bullcityflavors.com/indian-flavoring-hs/) Another [review of the e-liquid](http://tastyvapers.blogspot.com/2013/08/review-6-tobacco-eliquids-from-hangsen.html?m=1) and this guy loved it saying, “It has the undeniable flavor of a tobacco cigarette, but there's something else going on here!  Is it fruity?  Is it chocolate?  I just don't know!  But I like it!  It's interesting, it's different, it's nice.”\n\nThere was a “review” posted last night that has since been removed, but it was more a review of Butyric acid, so there’s that. \n\n[DIY_Ejuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)",

It's not sweet at all, it provides a very heavy and dense cream mouthfeel. A very potent flavor with strong sour notes, it tends to take on the characteristics of what you mix it with. Hard to describe, when mixed with cheesecake it tastes very much like a tangy cream cheese. When mixed with yogurts it tastes like a thick Greek yogurt. Single flavor it's almost like a thick sour cream with slight cheesy notes.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:** Tanginess, cheesy?\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit:** 1/10\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Uses:** Excellent for adding tanginess to most any mix. Works well with other creams or dairy to tone it down. Excellent to add that cream cheese tang that is missing in all the cheesecake flavorings. I use this anywhere I want cream cheese flavor, cheesecakes, danishes, frostings. Fantastic for yogurts and some cereals too. Great with FLV frosting and/or LA Cream Cheese Icing as part of a base for cream cheese frosting.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Notes:** In mixes I use 1-2 drops up to 1%. My average seems to be .5%. Extremely potent and will overwhelm everything if not careful. Great dense mouthfeel, but even using it by the drops, the tang is noticeable so it won't work just for adding body. I can't make cheesecake without it. It works best with sweeteners in dessert or sweet applications. I don't use sweetener a lot, but it pairs well with this one.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Other opinions:** From ELR,  bluenose63: \"Hangsen best Cream out there for Bakery imho\". Bradslinux: \"If you want a REAL heavy and VERY RICH cream note, Italian Cream (Hangsen) is wonderful.\" DarthVapor: \" Italian cream has a really nice tangy-ness to it, akin to yogurt and..well...cheesecake\". Amy***: \"Heavy Heavy cream on the stern side and not a sweet cream more mascarpone like with a greek yogurt like tartness but cleaner tasting. Wonderful in desserts/bakery flavors. Have used 0.3-3% The more you use be sure to steep it so the flavor can relax and allow other flavors to develop.\"",

Not really fruity or too sweet. Flavor profile is the same at both strengths. \n\n**Off-flavors:** None\n\n**Throat hit:** Medium. The dryness of the Tobacco note kind of hits the back of the throat more. The plum/prune flavor hits more on the back of the tongue. 10% mix is obviously a little stronger here. \n\n**Uses:** I think my preferred single flavor mix would be closer to the 10% range. If used as a base for a tobacco mix, I'd keep the percentage kind of high- probably in the 6-8% range. If you want to add a bit of flavorful ashiness to a mix, maybe in the 3-5% range. It could maybe be used like Dirty Neutral Base, but with much higher percentages. I haven't tried this yet, but if I were to try to mimic this flavor, I'd probably try something like .5% or .75% DNB and maybe .5% INW Smoked Plum, and 2%-3% INW Garuda. I might give this a shot and edit this with results. But that should give you an idea of what the flavor profile is like. \n\n**Pairings:** Pipe/cigar tobaccos, fruits for a fruity tobacco, could try some nuts and caramel and vanilla. \n\n**Notes:** I believe the INW Fortuna Strike is a clone of this flavor. They are certainly similar, but not really exact. Fortuna is almost a prune syrup kind of flavor with subtle tobacco notes hidden in the back. Magic Mix is more up front with the Tobacco and ash, with subtle plum notes. I probably wouldn't sub one for the other, but you might be able to get away with it. I'll personally probably stick with the INW because it's a little stronger and cheaper. I've always been hesitant with HS because it's more expensive and seems to need a bit more to really pop. Nonetheless, Magic Mix is a pretty solid flavor. I'll probably just rock it single at 10%. \n\n\n\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

At 6% the roasted peanut is coming through much harder as borderline burnt and over-bearing, with not much peanut butter taste.  It coats my mouth/throat, causing the flavor to linger quite a bit longer than most others.\n\n**Off-flavors:** The nuts taste overly toasted at higher percentages and kind of take over the peanut butter.  If you use too much of this flavor, after a month or two steep, it develops an aroma of smashed beetles when you vape it.\n\n**Throat hit:** 2/10 Pretty smooth\n\n**Uses:** A pleasant and unique nutty light peanut butter accent under 1.5%, doesn't seem to carry a whole lot of peanut butter \"feel\" until you get above 2%.  I'd max this out around 4 or 5 % unless the inherent over-roasted peanut taste doesn't bother you.\n\n**Pairings:**  A cream or two for starters if you're chasing a more \"Skippy-esque\" peanut butter.  Nuts, tobaccos, custards and bakeries.  Fruits might be tricky with this flavor after a steep, but berries and fleshy fruits are great pairings with this as a shake n vape.  Citrus with this one is interesting and offers a fairly sharp contrast in flavor, but again it gets lost after a week or ten days steep.\n\n**Notes:** I was really hoping for a creamier peanut butter as sort of a \"be all end all\" over at /r/GooberGrapeVape.  This isn't really a bad peanut butter flavoring IMO, it just isn't what I was hoping for, and still has its uses.\n\nFlavor available at BCF [here](http://www.bullcityflavors.com/peanut-butter-hs/) \n\n[Link to e-liquid-recipes notes on this flavor](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/21716)\n\n[Link to all of our flavor reviews in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)\n\nEDIT: off flavors",

Still sticky sweet on the exhale. Dense and intense jammy strawberry hard candy. Really offputting sharp green flavor notes through the entire exhale and lingering on the back end. \n\n**Off-flavors:**  I'm going call that entire green flavor an off-flavor.  I've never been into it. YMMV, but I'm not a fan.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light throat hit, nothing too major.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I'd borrow wholesale from the uses for INW Wild Strawberry.  The only real use I see is adding some of that sweet jammy strawberry into fruit mixes and to pop other sweet berries.  That green note is going to get really weird when mixed with creams or bakeries.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nPercentage used is absolutely vital here. At 1% and below, I get a jammy candy strawberry.  If I start to go higher, this gets weird quick.  That overpowering green flavor starts to really push toward the front and by 2% I'd call it damn near unvapeable.  I'd use this as a supporting note at around .5% and maybe 1% for a primary note.  I'd really advise against using this higher than that.\n\nThis is really weird for me. Subjectively, I really don't enjoy this.  Objectively, it doesn't strike me as a raspberry, and it seems awful similar to INW Wild Strawberry.\n\n**Second Opinions:** \n\n[One note on ELR, reading only:  \"Preferred single flavor mix: 15.0% \"](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/22313)  When the revolution comes, user eggybread will be the first against the wall.\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** HS Red Energy @ 3%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 32 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Red bull, or it's non-union equivalent. Something like sweet-tarts and the floral part of TFA Raspberry Sweet.  No weird Monster style phenolic notes or overbearing sucralose edge.\n\nInhale is admittedly pretty intense. Floral, bitter raspberry notes in there along with a strong sweetness. No citrus taste really, but the inhale works a lot like a citrus with that bitter rind just building. Relatively dense and little syrupy.  Exhale opens up into a non-descript sweet-tart type of light fruity note.  Just a bit of chalkyness. Like the top notes from a mixed berry flavor on top of a powdered lemonade mix.  Overall effect is like sweet-tarts or 'murican style smarties. Sweetness is pronounced, but strangely natural tasting. I don't get a lot of aspartame bitterness.  Actually tastes a fair bit like red bull syrup, both because of that concentrated sweetness and some overall flatness.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Tastes like the chemical slurry it's supposed to.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Light. Not really a throat hit but that inhale is just a bit too sharp to be comfortable.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  So, for something more in line with an actual red bull you'd be fighting against the flatness and the syrupy quality here. I'd add some cactus or cap cucumber to water this down a bit.  Reports of using FA Fuji with similar concentrates, and I think it would have largely the same effect. Citrus carbonation seems like the play here.  Maybe something like TFA Key Lime or CAP Grapefruit.\n\nIn terms of mixing, this is pretty much limited to fruits. I'd stay away from anything floral like peach or pear.  Your best bet is going to be something bright and not too syrupy. A non-jammy strawberry or FA Kiwi would be a good fit. I could also see this with a sweeter citrus like CAP Sweet Tangerine.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nS&V concentration tasting, light and perfumey at .5%. Light, bitter candy raspberry at 1%. Sweetness shows up at 1.5% and by 2% is pretty solid.  With the sweetness comes the sweet-tarts. Starts to get unpleasantly floral and syrupy at 3%.  I'd mix with other fruits at 1.5% and use 2.5% for a strong red bull base.\n\nThe most important part of this, for me at least, is that it doesn't have that gross play-doh phenol note that original rockstar and monster tend to have. This tastes a little more true to actual red bull then FA Mad Fruit, and a lot richer and less gnarly than FW Red Bowl.  So yeah, if this your profile this concentrate seems like a pretty solid start.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nNot a whole lot. Bunch of lo-fi youtube reviews of the actual e-liquid that hangsen cranks out but nothing worth watching.\n\n[One substantive mention on this sub that I can find.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/4zfss7/energy_drink_recipes/) /u/billingsarmy/ commented in an energy drink post that: \"Hangsen red energy + ethyl maltol.

From a lot of \"US Red\" and similarly named flavors I tend to get kind of a harsh, Sweetart kind of taste. I think they think this makes them taste like Marlboro Reds for some reason.

Like TFA RY4 Double, but not so heavy on the Cyclotene. There’s a slight hint of nuttiness to it too, but it’s very subtle. I don’t really get a whole lot of tobacco, smoke, or ash here, but I’m not really too upset about it. It’s tasty. I think if RY4 Double is a bit too funky for you, this would be a good replacement. It seems about on par with the strength. 1.5% is definitely present, but it can be taken higher. I would probably stay away from anything too crazy though. 5% is about as high as I’d take it, with 2-3% probably being a bit more typical. \n\n**Off flavors:** Nope\n\n**Pairings:** Anywhere you’d use any RY4 flavor. There’s really too many things to even list, since I’ve seen RY4 Double mixed with just about everything. \n\n**Second Opinions:** Didn’t see anything on Reddit about it, but [three reviews on BCF are all positive](https://www.bullcityflavors.com/tab-blended-hs/) and touch on the nuttiness and RY4-esque taste. Probably wouldn’t go with their percentages. [Vaping Zone has some reviews](https://www.vapingzone.com/Tab-Blended-Concentrated-Hangsen-Flavor-/pid-804.html#customer_reviews_804) that are positive. Seems some people are getting more nutty taste than I am. Maybe that comes out more in the 10-15% range that so many people seem to be using. Couple mention this tasting like DK Tab. Never had that, so I can’t say one way or another. If you’ve had it and liked it, then that might excite you. I’m assuming it is a Hangsen e-liquid, which would make sense for this to taste the same. [ECF thread](https://www.e-cigarette-forum.com/threads/hangsen-e-liquid-dk-tab-taste-and-tab-flavor-concentrate-taste.659326/) confirms that it is a Hangsen Eliquid and that this is the same thing they use to make it. Also gives some more reasonable percentages that are a little closer to what I recommend above. \n\nThat should give you a pretty good idea.

Not a juicy watermelon, or candy watermelon kind of flavor.\n\nInhale is warm and floral. Tastes like the white border between the pink and green on watermelon.  Exhale has higher rose floral top notes. Green watermelon base.  Sweetness level is sort of subdued, a lot like actual watermelon.  A bit on the dry side, no real juiciness here. Lingering florals, but for first breath you take after the exhale manages to taste more like a watermelon than the actual vape. It's a bit odd.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Roses. The floral note tastes really similar to [HS Honey](https://redd.it/5sgwdc).  Really similar actually. Same wet rose garden type of thing.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Light, mostly from the florals here.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  It's sort of hard to recommend this for much. About the only thing I can think of would be like an aqua-fresca kind of mix where the freshness of that floral rose note might actually work to your benefit.  There may be some niche use in trying to replicate an actual slice of watermelon and really capture that white part of the rind.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nS&V concentration testing, this is definitely best low.  At .25%, you get a decent watermelon rind flavor with a bit of the floral rose. .5% fills that rind out and you get a hint of watermelon flesh. .75% is actually getting a bit weird for me. At 1% and above this starts tasting like cheap shampoo. The rose just dominates, and that green rind gets a bit aloe-y.  I'd mix with this down at .25-.5% to just punch up a melon mix.

This will be either Non-Aromatic or Aromatic and I will include whether it's a true tobacco leaf taste or not.\n\n- Aromatic pipe style tobacco: This has no real tobacco leaf flavor, instead it's meant to be a topping for pipe style blends. If you need clarification, look up aromatic vs non-aromatic tobacco.\n\n**Flavor Properties:**\n\n- aromatic \n- rich and complex\n- thick\n- smooth\n- slightly sweet\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Relatable Flavors:**\n\n- caramel (that's what I noticed first but it takes a back seat after a few puffs)\n- hint of vanilla\n- touch of rum\n- dash of spice (cinnamon maybe?)\n- ice wine type of sweetness but not sickly\n- cocoa on the tail end of the exhale\n- woodsy notes way in the background\n- some kind of dark fruit like a plum or raisin wafting in and out of the profile\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Mouth Feel:**\n\n- medium to heavy density\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:**\n\n- If I literally sniff the coil I detect an ever so slight plastic-y smell that doesn't seem to translate to the vapour itself.

Guys wanna be him and ladies wanna be with him.\n- Use as a standalone or invite some friends.\n- This flavor is a real thinker. I find myself vaping away, pondering the notes I'm tasting, trying to figure it out. There's some notes I can't quite put my finger on. Certain things pop out at you and then recede back into the profile. This shit is fun to vape.\n- Here's another user's synopsis that I pulled from ELR. It sums things up nicely..\n\n\"Am4a is slightly sweet and oh so smooth! Upon the first few vapes I detect a darker pipe style tobacco, with faint hints of chocolate or cocoa, roasted coffee bean, vanilla. As the vapor extends I believe I detect possible hints of caramel, rum, and maybe even a raisin back there too. The longer I vape it all the flavors all blend into a smooth and almost creamy dark pipe vape, with the vanilla and coffee/caramel intertwining into one in the background, leaving a lingering lighter note of chocolate/cocoa as the tobacco shines through it all.\"\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Recipe Suggestion:** This is a good 'get to know ya' recipe for Am4a, but you'll have lots of ideas of your own once you're better acquainted.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*important: Wayne is def not a tobacco head, he claims this tastes like a cig but it most definitely does not.

After a bit of a steep these elements actually come about a bit more, which surprised me. By the end of a two week steep the flavor had turned into a slightly tart and sweet, bright, and crisp apple. The flavor isn't spot on, it would need to be juicier at the very least to be more realistic - but its a good green apple flavor nonetheless.\n\n**Off-notes:** None that I noticed. Might get weird or floral at higher percentages.\n\n**Throat hit:** 6/10. The flavor is a kinda dry and harsh on the throat.\n\n**Uses:** Might work as a single flavor mix for some people, but adding just a few other flavors would make it so much better. /u/NotCharlesManson did this incredibly well in [Antoine](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/4282#antoine_by_notcharlesmanson), which is a bright green apple with tropical notes as described by the man himself. I use it mainly to brighten up fruit mixes or in a candy vape I want to add a bit of sweet/tart, both can be achieved using it at around or under 1%.\n\n**Pairings:** Fruits, candies, drinks/cocktails (appletini anyone?). I've tried it in creams and it is okay, I would NOT try it in bakeries or tobaccos. \n\n**Overall Impression:** While it isn't the most accurate representation of a green apple (it isn't tart or juicy enough) its still a good apple flavor. I have only had Fuji to compare it to, and both are good but have different apple profiles they aim to achieve (red vs. green), so aren't very interchangeable. If your looking for a slightly tart and sweet, kinda bright and crisp green apple INW Anton Apple might be what you're looking for.\n\nPlease put any other opinions on this flavor in the comments, and as usual let me know any way you all think the reviews could be improved.

You can easily detect some darker berries. According to inawerawinkel, this is supposed to be wild blueberries, but I'm picking up notes from dates and black berries and not really any wild blueberries. Has a strong scent of a more sweet tobacco.\n\n**Taste:**\n\nOn day 1 fresh after mix, you definitely taste a whole lot of leaf mixed with cough syrup and some darker unsweetened berries. Not sour but not really sweet either. A little flat and not very appealing.\n\nAfter 3 weeks steep: I don't detect a whole lot of berries. It's still very leafy - which aren't a bad, but I'm really missing some berries here. Has a stronger after-taste of some sweet tobacco buried somewhere in the leafy flavor, that kinda lingers in your mouth for a good while. The only hint of berries I can pick up, are a very weak flavor of perfume much like you'd find in more floral berry flavors. It's so weak however, that I really doubt it'll show up in any mix with this concentrate.\n\n**Throat hit:** 3/10 - It has a bit of itching right there at the end, but nothing overpowering.\n\n**Off notes:** None other than the perfume really - the cough syrup has pretty much vanished after 3 weeks, so that's a thing.\n\n**Pairings:**\n\nIt's hard for me to find anything, but tobacco recipes to use this for. It's not sweet enough to be used in any sort of dirty desserts or bakeries. Further I can't really see this concentrate work very well with brighter fruits either. Mixes infused with darker berries and fruits + other tobaccos or stronger booze is where I can see this one really shine. With some help from other darker berries and fruits, I think the berries that are supposed to be in this will appear a little better. Probably more of an accent tobacco than a center-player here.\n\nFor standalone mix: 3-5%In a mix: 1.5-3%\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nDue to the lack of berries, I can't really see this as a concentrate I'll be using that much. It falls a little flat and doesn't really bring any wow-effect to a mix. Although, I believe tobacco-lovers will be able to twist this concentrate to their linkings. But this is definitely not a concentrate for people who has a hard time with tobacco. Solo vaping this actually almost makes me gag - hah!\n\n[**DIY\\_eJuice Flavor Reviews**](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)",

    "markdown": "##**INW Black Cherry for Pipe**##\n\n*Summary*  \n*Tested at 3%*  \nThis is a surprisingly smooth, cherry pipe tobacco. It's not smokey like I had anticipated the \"For Pipe\" line being after trying INW Black for Pipe. The cherry is delicious (not medicinal at all) and very pronounced, with a nice deep pipe tobacco in the background. I'm no expert in tobaccos, so it'll be hard for me to liken it to a type of tobacco, but I don't get much nuttiness, just kind of a nice, deep, dry, leafy pipe tobacco. The cherry note is somewhat sweet so if you're looking for a not-so-sweet cherry tobacco vape, I would recommend using this as an accent to another tobacco to provide the cherry accent to the tobacco.\n\n**On the Nose**  \nVery Cherry forward, slight tobacco essence\n\n**Recommended Usage**  \n*Stand alone*: 2-3%\n\n*In a mix*: 1-2%.  \n\n**Throat**  \nMild, thumpy, not sharp or scratchy/dry\n\n**Pairings**  \nCherry, dark fruits, coffee, other tobaccos. \n\n**Avoid**  \nNot too sure here, probably brighter fruits and creams.\n\n**Steep**  \n2-3 Weeks. Tobacco becomes much more pronounced and \"full\" after a steep.  \n\n**Recipe Ideas**  \n\nHonestly this concentrate is really great on its own.

    "markdown": "**Setup:** Recoil RDA. Dual kanthal clapton coils @ 0.3 ohm. 50w power, Cotton Bacon wicks. \n\n**Testing:** INW Bubblegum @ 1%, 2.5%, and 4% 70/30 VG/PG, Steeped 5 and 12 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Authentic classic pink bubblegum. Not dry or stale enough to read as Topps baseball card gum, not chalky enough to call it Dubble Bubble, but lacking the mouthwatering quality it would need get into Bubblicious or Big League Chew territory. Some thickness, but lacking a chewy texture. Most like a gumball machine gumball in classic pink flavor. Inhale is soft pink, top of the exhale starts with a sharper pink gum flavor that quickly softens and gathers some volume, though not quite enough to be called chewy, and ends with an even softer, more powdery (but not chalky) sweetness. \n\n**Off-flavors:** None at 2.5% and below. \n\n**Throat Hit:** None.   \n\n**Notes:** 1% is a full-flavored bubblegum vape but lacks the bit of texture this picks up at 2.5%. That texture still isn't enough to sink your teeth into and chew, but it's a bit of thickness that does contribute to a more bubblegummy vape. 4% starts to bring in a weird warmth like freshly ABC gum, which is kinda gross, like kissing someone and having them leave their gum in your mouth. It's a warmth similar to what you'd get from a candy cinnamon flavor, without the cinnamon flavor. Longer steeping doesn't seem to have much effect on it. \n\n**Uses & Pairings:** 2.5% standalone for a straight up bubblegum vape. I'd experiment with additives that might give it some of that mouthwatering aspect of gum - low percentages of things like Cactus or Pink Guava or citrus flavors or Yakima Hops, for example. Or thickening ingredients like Vanilla Swirl or a marshmallow at no more than 2% for chewiness. Or sweetener, if you swing that way. Some combination of the above. \n\n1% or less with various fruits, if you want something like a fruit gumball that combines both the classic pink gum flavor and your fruit of choice. Don't expect to add this to grape and get grape Bubblicious, though. For that you want texture, this one is much more pink flavor than chewy mouthwatering gum texture, which is what you want for top-notch fruit gum. You're not going to be able to cover up the pink and get just gum-ness out of it. I hear mixing with this is tricky because it's a bully and I have reason to believe it: 2% of this added to 8% total of three FA fruits is a solidly bubblegum flavor with fruit accents in /u/drumbtr's [recipe](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/35867#blow_my_strap_on_by_drumbtr) that I initially bought this for. I had a bottle of my Mother of Dragons' Milk recipe with a 1:1 sub of CAP Dragon Fruit for the TFA version that I'd been vaping on and just for fun, just added roughly 2% INW Bubblegum (YC) to that. Shake and vape testing, definitely a bubblegum-forward flavor with a dragonfruit backdrop. It's... interesting, but tasty.  \n\nA more conservative use that likely allows other flavors to share the limelight can be seen in this [Late Night Gum](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/47809#late_night_gum_by_trandism) recipe by Trandism. \n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nNot really, but if you want opinions on other bubblegum flavors, check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1r57eRMHJM) where I talk them over with co-hosts MlNikon, CheebaSteeba, and a guest. Summary for those who don't want to watch: Everyone has their own favorite bubblegum flavor, and this one is mine. Also, don't accidentally go out in search of INW Bubble Gum (yc) and accidentally buy INW Purple Gum. It's laundry detergent. I'll do a full review on that one once I have a chance to do some lower concentration testing and see if it gets palatable below 1%. \n\n**Just for Fun:**\n\nIf you're a drinker and a bubble gum lover, there's bubblegum vodka, but that involves the embarrassment of buying bubble gum vodka. If you want to be able to show your face in the liquor store again, try a shot of 2 parts Irish cream, 1 part banana liqueur, and 1 part blue curacao. Tastes like bubblegum! \n\nBe sure to check out all of the other great reviews at \n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**\n",

Citrus and tropical notes throughout.  Hints of a ripe pear or green grape.  Almost seems to imply a very subtle cooling effect at the end of the exhale.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  None noticed.  \n\n**Throat hit:** 5/10. \n\n**Uses:**  Brightening up other fruits or adding juiciness.  Really brightens up a bland mix at 1-2%.  Very stellar as a standalone too.\n\n**Pairings:** Basically any fruit.  I'd even guess this flavor at 4% or more would hold it's own against a heavier cream.\n\n**Notes:** I've never eaten cactus, which is why it isn't in my description. You NEED this flavor in your arsenal if you enjoy fruit vapes.  Buy more than you think you'll use, and don't run out.  It's a real gem.  \n\nEDIT : I must add that if you put this on your coils, the flavor is probably not going to go away.\n\nEDIT 2: [Link to all of our flavor reviews in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** INW Cactus Lime @1%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 10 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Pretty much just a mix of INW Cactus and INW Lime. Tastes maybe a bit heavier on the cactus than the lime, if I had to guess this is maybe 75% Cactus, 25% lime although don't quote me on that.  With some random S&V testing of a mix of cactus and lime, I'd say the main difference is that this is a bit softer, but a lengthy steep would probably make them fairly indistinguishable.\n\nInhale is dense. Solid, cactus (has always reminded me of a severely underripe banana) flavor and a building soft lime zest. None of the real sharp zest flavor from a solo lime flavor.  Fairly sweet as well, with some lighter floral aloe notes. Exhale is still really dense, but a little less juicy than straight cactus. That cactus is right up front in the base, with some higher lime juice notes and a really solid sweetness.  Exhale is fairly clean, without either the lingering bitterness from the lime or the more vegetal muck of straight cactus.\n \n**Off-flavors:**  These flavors do a really good job of cleaning each other up. The lime essentially negates some of the green weirdness you can get out of cactus...\n\n**Throat Hit:**... and the cactus smooths any of the harshness you'd normally get out the lime. It's a really neat trick, actually.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:** This is actually a pretty good single flavor.  Nice and balanced without anything sticking out too far. The cactus reels in the lime a bit, while the lime keeps the cactus going too floral and aloe-ish.\n\nIf you aren't going to use it as a a single flavor, then basically stick it wherever you want some cactus with a lime touch.  Going to pair well prety much any kind of fruit.  I'm a fan of cactus with non-creamy vanillas or sweeter florals, and I think the lime would further complement those.\n\nGreat beverage vape ingredient, adding mouthfeel and a touch of cactus while reinforcing citrus. I dare say this probably a great jump-off for a margarita recipe.\n\nNot crazy juicy like Cactus, but it does a good job of thickening without moistening.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nS&V concentration, the balance here really does work to make this a more forgiving than either component is solo. Under 1%, this reads as a more interesting cactus flavor, with the lime in the accent role. At about 1-1.5%, the lime starts to show up as more of a identifiable flavor.  The balance on this is great at 2%, with bright citrus showing up alongside a deeper cactus smoothness and sweetness. By 3%, I feel like the lime is taking over a bit and the citrus is getting really prominent. At 4%, this is getting too zesty and bitter and the aloe is starting to show through pretty clear. Mixing with this, I'd recommend starting at 1.5% as an accent note for fruits, 2% for a solo, or 3% in beverage vapes where the bright lime is key.\n\nSo I was wondering if this was substantially different than INW Cactus mixed with INW Lime, and as far as I can tell it isn't. That's not necessarily a bad thing, as I'm a big fan of both of these flavors and they blend really well... it just makes this concentrate fairly inessential as you can just pick up Lime and Cactus and mix something more tailored to your taste.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nAlmost nothing on this concentrate specifically.\n\nRunning with the idea that this probably just a mix of INW Cactus and INW Lime, here are the flavor reviews.\n\n[INW Cactus Flavor Review.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/4oale0/inw_cactus_flavor_review/)\n\n[INW Lime Flavor Review.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/5ykmh0/inw_lime/)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

    "markdown": "So this is my first post with any actual substance to it, and it's a flavor I'm really excited about. I hope you're able to make use of the notes or enjoy the recipe.  \n**INW Cherimoya**  \nRecommended %: 1-3%  \nFlavor: Similar to that of a mixture between pineapple, banana, apple, and melon.  \nTexture/Palate: Slightly creamy, slightly sweet, very smooth, slightly perfumy.  \nProfile: Tropical  \n\nEver since I saw this flavoring, it’s had me interested. I went down to the market, picked out a cherimoya, and waited until it was ripe to consume. Being pleasantly surprised, I decided to check out the flavor. Again, I am pleasantly surprised. I honestly didn’t know what to expect from the flavoring, as the Cherimoya is a pretty unique fruit. It’s also quite tasty as a solo flavor.  \nThe Cherimoya flavor gains some additional creaminess as a vape and loses some of the acidity from the fruit that was a bit strong for me. To make up for this, you’re going to want to bring something to brighten up the cherimoya. It’s very easily overpowered though if you want it to be a main note, so use restraint. You’re probably going to end up with a very lightly flavored recipe when using this guy. I’ve found Cardamom to be the Cherimoya’s best friend.  \n  \n**Cherimoya’s friends:** *Cardamom*, Pineapple, apple, coconut, lemon, light creams, lychee  \n**Cherimoya bullies:** Heavy creams, earthy tones, dark flavor  \n\n**Cherimoya Rabri (Exotic Custard)**  80VG/20PG  \n* INW Cherimoya @ 3%  \n* FA Vienna Cream @ 2%  \n* FA Fresh Cream @ 1.5%   \n* FA Meringue @ 1%  \n* FA Almond @ 1%  \n* FA Cardamom @ .125%  \n* (Optional) FA Lychee @ .5%-1%  \n\n*Vienna Cream:* The Vienna Cream helps bring some creaminess and sweetness to the party as well as just a *touch* of vanilla. Surprisingly enough, vanilla does not play well with Cherimoya in my experience, and leaves the liquid muddy  \n*Fresh Cream:* Brings some more cream to the party without being too heavy.  \n*Meringue:* This one again brings out some sweet creaminess, but this is mostly used for its sweet properties. A traditional Rabri calls for some sugar, but you can't use a dark sugary profile, and you don't want to use sucralose to overshadow the delicate flavor of the Cherimoya.  \n*Almond:* Called for as a garnish in the Rabri, also brings some earthiness to the creams to make them a little more realistic. The nuttiness is just barely in the background keeping your palate interested.  \n*Cardamom:* This flavor makes the Rabri. It brings this slightly sweet, spicy tone to the party and really brightens up the Cherimoya and makes him the star. Without it, this flavor is really hard for me to work in to a recipe. You can take this lower, prob .25% if you don't like it as spicy, and I wouldn't bring it higher than .5% or it will take over.  \n*Lychee:* Lychee is a nice element that was in my original Exotic Custard that I wanted to keep. The original recipe for the Rabri actually calls for rose, and the Lychee makes a nice sort of fruity perfumey substitute for that. It actually plays well off of the slight perfuminess from the Cherimoya when used at low %  \n\nI tried a number of iterations trying to find out what would go well with the Cherimoya. I'm sure there are some good parings that I missed, so if you have any ideas I'd love to hear them.  \n\n**Edit - 2/25/16:** After throwing this in a tank, the cardamom seems a little heavy (had only been testing it on a dripper). I'll make a dilution of cardamom tonight and give it a go, I'm thinking .125%; minor tweaks to recipe to follow.  \n**Edit - 2/29/16:** So a good steep really makes that cardamom come through a little more than I want it to. I've dropped the cardamom to .125% (you could bring this as low as .0625% if you don't want the spiciness coming through too much) and upped the cream fresh a half of a percent",

Exhale has a lighter rainier cherry sweetness right down the middle. No floral component here, although the top notes taste a lot like raw vg.  Back half of the exhale has spicier, tannic, dry top notes that show up out of that raw vg taste.  Relatively clean finish, with some lingering dryness.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  I'm getting a decent amount of spiciness here. Hard to place, not like distinct cloves like INW Cherry Concentrate, more like a dry, earthy, tannic, berry skin kind of spice. Almost like blueberry skins. No plastic though, so that's cool.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Light, mostly from the dryness.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:** So this tastes really great, but it doesn't have much body. It needs some help getting up to a full saturated cherry flavor. Something like INW Cherry at .75% helps provide a richer, fuller bottom end of a cherry while letting this fill in the top notes.  In the same vein, FA Apricot or an apple or pear flavor can fill in some of the juicier low-end you'd expect from a fuller cherry.\n\nUseful to add really distinct cherry top notes to fruit mixes. Non-floral and pretty mellow, so your fruit pairings are basically wide open.  Doesn't seem to like stand up front solo, so you'll likely end up with a cherry twinge as opposed to a distinct cherry flavor.\n\nThis is also the cherry you want to use if mixing with creams or bakeries. You won't get a ton of body, but there is nothing here that will clash with heavy dairy notes or dense bakeries.  Using some marzipan will help to really fill in the base of a baked cherry flavor for fillings and the like.\n\n**Notes:**  I'm having some serious issues getting something that feels like a full, saturated vape from this concentrate solo. This stuff seems really airy, no matter the percentage. S&V concentration testing, this is noticeable but light at .5%.  I get some lighter cherry top notes and that light spice note.  1% is still seeming very airy.  This seems to be mostly top notes without any substantial body.  The actual flavor here is good, it's just fairly subtle. 2% is largely similar, if a bit heavier on that dry spicy top note.  3% has a good tart rainier cherry note, but again those drier spicy top notes are getting in the way. 4% is finally starting to push towards medicinal, but there is no weird plastic note. Still dry, tart, and spicy.  The good news is that this is a pretty forgiving mixer. I don't think your going to run a mix by working with a heavy hand here. I'd start with this at 1% if you want to add a bit of cherry to a fruit mix. I'd probably bump up to about 2.5% and work up for mixing with bakeries, creams, or as a strong cherry that you're going to fill in with a juicier base.\n\nAll in all, a really good flavor... I just wish it hit a bit harder. Solo, I can't personally get away from the thinner, drier, airy character of this concentrate. I think it's a great mixer, but not like the one-shot answer to all your cherry prayers.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[ELR is mostly just one repackaged review talking about tasting like \"wild cherry, maybe Swiss with a little back-note of maraschino.\"](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/33818)\n\n[Glowing reviews on BCF.](http://www.bullcityflavors.com/cherries-inw/)  Realistic, not cough syrup, \"best cherry flavor\" appears multiple times.\n\n[Cheeba likes it, so that's something.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/5wys09/inw_cherry_concentrate/deeinl0/)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** INW Cherries in Liqueur, 3 and 6%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 9 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  A cherry and chocolate flavored liqueur.\n\nI don't get an overwhelming cherry out of this.  It seems like a darker cherry flavor, not like a bright red maraschino cherry.  I don't get anything too overtly realistic out of this, it's feeling a lot like the kind of slightly dry, thin kind of cherry vibe like from INW Cherries, albiet a bit closer to a black cherry.  I feel like I'm not picking up a real cherry body, just some cherry flavor.  Same kind of familiar cherry off-notes here, but it isn't overwhelming at least in balance with everything else going on here.\n\nIn terms of the liqueur part of this, I'm going back and forth a bit.  I do think there is some kind of booziness in here, but it feels like an artificial kind of spiced rum flavor.  No specific spice sticks out and it's a bit hard to pick out a discrete alcohol note with some of the cherry off-notes floating around.\n\nI also get a good deal of chocolate here.  Checking the second opinions, I might be picking it up a bit more than other people or something here is just hitting me weird.  Overall the concentrate reminds me a lot of a cheap cherry cordial candy somehow made into a liqueur.  The chocolate is more like a medium-dark cocoa note without any kind of waxy or rich body.\n\nMouthfeel overall feels a bit thin and dry for something that should have a pretty heavy liquid component.\n\nThis is fairly dark and the chocolate thing makes me worry a bit about coil gore.  I'm getting a bit of muting and some muddiness to the flavor, but I haven't noticed anything that seems like burning.  FWIW, I'm thinking INW Cherries in Liqueur and INW Cherry Liqueur are the same thing.  I can't find any references to a specific INW Cherry Liqueur on the Inawera storefronts.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Chocolate.  A pretty sizable amount of chocolate.  If this is liqueur I'd guess it's a chocolate liqueur. Not a bad thing per se, but a pretty substanial contribution to the profile.  At higher percentages I do pick up some plasticy cherry off notes, but they're relatively subtle compared to other cherry concentrates at comparable strengths. \n\n**Throat Hit:**  Moderate.  Overall just a bit harsh and dry for me.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 1%, I'm not getting much cherry.  There's a bit of it, but it feels like it's being drowned out a bit by some of those boozy notes.  Not quite plasticy but it's sort of thin and bitter. I pick up a good bit of that chocolate on the tail of the inhale and the exhale.\n\nAt 2.5% there's a clearer cherry for here, and I'm getting some good cherry sweetness and a darker, not too cloying cherry flavor.  The booze notes here seem a bit toned down, but I'm feeling like the off-notes from the cherry are coming out a bit more. Fairly strong darker cocoa here for me.\n\nJust based on these tests, I'd probably go around 1.5-2% in mixes where the chocolate and cherry are a fit for the profile.  I feel like the cherry and the chocolate are pretty well intertwined and will be distracting if you want one but not the other.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Pretty good solution for getting some cherries and chocolate together.\n\nSeems like a really good fit for anything that is supposed to use a cherry cordial, maybe with some additional cream or something like FW White Chocolate to fill out that darker cocoa note and a juicier red berry to fill out the cherry note.\n\nI could also see this working really well in a black forest cake recipe.  Actually a pretty stand in for kirsch if the profile will handle the chocolate.\n\n**Second Opinions:** [Here's the ELR Page.]  No mention of chocolate, so maybe I've completely lost it.  User \"naxoc\" writes: \" Very intensive cherry taste with a hint of sweet liquer. Add 3-4%.\"  User Monk writes: \"Tested about 1% in a premade icecreambase. Meant to buy Cherries... but this one is quite nice! (maybe not in the icecream). It has something that makes me want to throw it into a tobacco, chocolate or coffee rather then fruits, candy or softdrinks. A taste for grownups. Maybe its the liqueur-part that makes that darkness.\"\n\n[Here's the review from the Inawera review page by \"Aurora-Oblivion\" on ECF that's been hanging around for a while:](https://www.e-cigarette-forum.com/forum/threads/inawera-flavor-review-45-flavors-from-inawerashop-add-yours-too.546838/)\n\n\"4 drops per 5ml was too weak to properly describe flavor, increased that to 7 drops per 5ml then waited another 14 days to taste again. I detect dark rum (?) soaked cherries. Not quite sure on the liqueur used here, but to me it tastes kind of like a dark non-spiced rum, cherry flavor is not \"popping\" out at me, but more of a lightly blended cherry into the dark rum/alc taste. And I do believe I detect a VERY faint tobacco note in there as well possibly.\n\nAbove average TH for this one. This would be great mixed into a alcohol type drink, or a citrus mixed type drink like MT Dew or Hypno, and I'm sure this would be a welcomed addition to a dark pipe style tobacco as well!\"\n\n[Here's a review from user \"Bryan123456\" on Planet of the Vapes](https://www.planetofthevapes.co.uk/forums/product-reviews/flavour-concentrate-reviews/beverages/threads/cherry-liqueur-inawera.4626/) that starts out talking about someone's aunt getting drunk, but it does contain the following: \"There’s a lovely exhale with a cherry note and I like this very much. It’s vapeable from 4 drops into 5ml (1.6%). I went up to 12 drops (4.6%) and it was sooo cherryish. I finally mixed this up at 6% and then soused it with sweetener and got the De Kuyper thing.\"\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** INW Cherry Concentrate @ %1, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 9 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Like vaping wild cherry cough drops with just a hint of the plastic wrapper still on there, which isn't as bad it sounds next to some of the other cherries available.  Good, fairly realistic, slight sour note overall but doesn't quite gel with the cherry candy underneath.\n\nInhale is mostly medicinal.  Pretty robutussin-y, moderate density and a light sweetness.  Exhale has some bright candy cherry up front.  Definitely a bright red, cherry candy kind of maraschino vibe. Bitter eucalyptus cooling top notes up front that get plastic-y toward the back end of the exhale. Definitely lingers and pushes toward full plastic.  Good tartness overall though, adding a little bit of nuance to that sweet cherry candy flavor.  Not really realistic, but comes closer than most candy cherry flavors.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Yeah, this still tastes like plastic. It's less pronounced than something like FA Cherry or god forbid, FLV Rainier Cherry, but you get a weird, almost cooling, medicinal eucalyptus with some of that plastic flavor that seems to haunt cherry flavors.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Initially starts out pretty harsh. Settles in pretty quickly though. I'd still call it a moderate throat hit, seems to be causing a good deal of chest tightness. Hard to take bigger draws.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:** As a primary note, it's more of a candy cherry. I'm thinking you'll get the best results adding this into a fairly busy juice for that burst of cherry up front, and hoping you've got enough going on in the backend of the juice to hide that plastic, medicinal tinge. Works well with candy texturizers like CAP Jelly Candy and FW Hard Candy.  The tartness here would make a good base for a sour cherry candy.\n\nHarder to pair with fruit flavors.  I'd stick with flatter, juicier fruits like FA Apricot, Pear, Fuji, or maybe a non-harsh melon flavor.  Could work to brighten up syrupy berries like FLV Boysenberry.\n\nI'd stay away from this in creams or bakeries, I've never got anything with that plastic note to really mesh well with anything creamy or particularly dense.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nS&V concentration testing, .25% seems a bit weak, but there is a nice fairly realistic sweet and sour cherry thing going on with a hint of that medicinal vibe. .5% still isn't saturated, but it's pretty pleasant. .75% is starting to get that plastic taste to it. Cherry is more sour than sweet. 1% starts to bring in some more the sweetness. Medicinal note is getting some cooling to it, and that plastic taste is getting a bit intense. 1.5% is getting plasticy, and that cooling is starting to taste a bit like cloves. 2% is about my maximum for this. I'm getting clove and plastic more than actual cherry.  I'd start with this at .75% and work up for a primary cherry candy note.  Identifiable in a mix as low as .25% so maybe start there if you want to work in a hint of sour cherry into a fruit mix.\n\nI've got a tester down with INW Cherries, so I'll try that out tomorrow so I can offer a good contrast between the two.  It's really damning this with faint praise, but this is one of the better candy cherry concentrates available, that tart note is great and the off-flavors aren't as bad as some of the available options.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Pretty solid notes on ELR.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/3882)  Mixed opinions, both saying it's \"foul and medicinal\" and saying it's better than some of the other options.\n\n[/u/NotCharlesManson/ calls it \"more of a candy cherry, almost like a Jolly Rancher.  I couldn't really see it mixing well with bakery, but it's really good with other fruits.\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/3tuh41/inw_cherry_question/)\n\n[More talk on INW Cherry flavors. /u/thewomberchomby says \"no medicinal taste at all.\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/3lzzth/inawera_cherry_which_one/)  I don't really agree, but it's good to know that I might just be overly sensitive to it or tasting this wrong.\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Good at 3.5% if you like in your face flavor or your taste buds are still healing from smoking. In mixes I think start at .5% depending on how upfront you want the flavor. This is actually pretty good as a stand alone flavor.

Tastes like burnt sugar caramel  flavor, semi thick eggy (not so much as FA meringue)custard, with a sweet well rounded vanilla flavor blended somewhere in the middle.\n\nThe vanilla is sweet and almost fruity in a sense. I almost taste something that like FA mango or coconut on the exhale. They might share some constituents in small amounts.  The flavors are all blended together well.\n\nI think trying to disect  and analyze every nuance of this one doesn't do it as much justice as just telling you this is a kick ass creme brulee flavor that's a lil heavy on the caramel IMO. I Think it's worth the price and that you should also pick up INW custard to blend or appreciate separately.

It smells like sweet watermelon with a bit of lemon and Haribo balla-balla jellies, if you know what I mean. If you smell 'em, you'll know!\n\n\n**Throat hit** is quite strong with this one, but I could feel that way because I changed the coil night before this test. Old one was.. well, really old! Strong throat hit is not uncommon with INW concentrates, though. And I like that.\n\n**The taste** is consistent with how it smells. It's lightly sweet, but it's also refreshing. You get that taste like when drinking a cucumber-lemon drink, it's quite distinctive, but really delicate. I was kind of worried that it'd taste also like a watermelon, and it does. Like a watermelon candy. Moreover, I can taste ICE. By ice, a mean menthol, it adds this fresh and cold feeling on the throat. I really like that effect.\n\nUses and pairings: I would vape it solo, but I also tried it with some of the INW's new citrus concentrates and it worked out nice, so you can boost the freshness factor further by adding something like that. If you're a menthol guy/gal, you can add some more of that, too.\n\nPersonal testing notes: 30 drops per 30 ml is actually too much. Next time I'd go with 15-20.\n\n**Summary:** This is a pre-premiere, a tasting phase of new INW concentrates. I don't know if this one will make it onto the market, but I'd like it if it did. It's a nice, refreshing concentrate, but it doesn't exactly taste like a cucumber. They also provided me with a solo cucumber concentrate, so I'll try that and let you guys know.\n\n**Questions:** DM or mrgvape@gmail.com.\n\n**Disclaimer:** I wasn't paid to write this review. It's my personal hobby that I do in my free time. And one more thing. I don't have the pallette of a renowned chef or wine taster. I'm a simple man with simple taste buds, so my reviews are mostly suited for regular vapers who do not need advanced equipment and just want to know how something tastes. It's not my style to write something like this \"it tastes like a cucumber gently brushed by sunrays in western Europe and then cut into thin pieces with the finest knife. It reminds me of my childhood in Algeria, where I longed for a cucumber like this.. When it hits your tongue, you feel all kinds of emotions, starting with joy and sole happiness, but then you're overwhelmed with this great, cucumber-caused clarity... Life is great.\" Nope. It's watermelony cucumber. EOT.",

Vapor is thick and smooth.\" \n\nA [Bull City Flavor Reviewer](http://www.bullcityflavors.com/custard-inw/) had this to say, \"Very nice flan/creme brûlée custard without the burnt sugar crust or any citrus, but with a touch of cookie/biscuit and some light vanilla. Straight-forward, light, and so far it's been easy to mix with. \n\nI used this at 2%, and it took on a slightly chemical taste at higher percentages.

I used a combination of FA Custard and JF Lemon Juicy to add a lemon note to complement the brightness of INW Custard and TFA Pistachio to bring a little bit of nutty darkness to the party. \n\nOverall i like this vape, especially the lemony mixed with custard. in future iterations i think i'm going to drop the Pistachio, after trying several recipes with it i think i'm just not a fan. Also in consideration is adding some FW Butterscotch Ripple at a low percentage to bring some more creamy caramel into play.\n\n[Link to all of our flavor reviews in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)",

Overall it smells like beer that has been boiled down. :)\n\n**The inhale.**\n\nAt the inhale, there is a throat hit but a little bit different that I knew before. It hits me at the back of my tounge, dunno why. It's not too much though. \nThe taste when inhaling reminds me of the taste that is left on the tounge when swallowing beer. You know what I'm talking about? That pleasant mix of a delicate sourness, hop, and something kinda malty.\nOh yeah. After a few hits I can definetly taste the hop in there.\n\n**The exhale.**\n\nThroat hit at the exhale is heavier than when inhaling.\nThe taste is composed of something a little bit sweet, but also, which is interesting, a slight bitterness, and a lot of malt. It could use some more hop, though. \nThe first thing that I taste is definetly the malt and bitter notes. You know those malt non-alcoholic drinks? Well this is somewhat similar. I can taste some grain coffe notes, too.\nI can say that it really tastes and smell like beer, and if I had to compare it to any beers I know of, it would be a Guinness. It's quite light, not overwhelming.\n\n**Uses and pairings**: I think I would pair it with anything, really. Vanilla, raspberry, would be my go-to choices. When I first tried it, I had some leftover lemon juice in my tank and it mixed well, lemme tell you.\n\n**Personal testing notes**: 2% is good, but for me you can go higher for a more defined and \"beery\" experience.\n\n**Second opinions**: One of my friends said \"this is freaking great\". I must admit, if you spill it somewhere, your room will smell like a week of drinking.\n\n**Summary:** For me it's great, but it will not be my go-to juice because not everybody fancy the beer smell that it leaves.\n\nQuestion, anyone tried the INW Little Red Cap concentrate? I have a few concerns about the smell when it touches anything outside the tank...\n\nquestions/co-op/review propositions: mrgvape@gmail.com",

    "markdown": "**Setup:** Recoil w/ flavor barrel, Dual 15 wrap 26g 3mm Nifethal 70 coils @.18 ohms.  60w power, 450F temp limit. Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** INW Dragon Fruit @ %1, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 7 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** A Rorshach test of a flavor. You name a fruit flavor and you can probably find it in there somewhere. Personally, I taste a mix of light hibiscus-y pineapple and prickly pear (INW Cactus, specifically), but I wouldn't argue with you if you talked about apples, strawberries, kiwis, pears, or even a touch of banana.  Really thick and dense flavor, with a disconcertingly smooth mouthfeel.  Tastes about 3/4's of the way to /u/ID10-T/ 's [Mother of Dragons' Milk solo.](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/6851#mother_of_dragons_milk_by_id10_t)\n\nInhale is really dense.  Fairly neutral soft pineapple flavor, but dense as all hell. Creamy even, without any kind of dairy notes. Exhale has some really light floral hibiscus top notes with a subtle kind of light pineapple sweetness in the base. Really dense, soft vape. Not a \"juicy\" flavor per se, but heavily dense without being dry.  Super clean finish, no real change from the beginning of the vape through the end.. the flavor just kind of fades out.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Again, i'm kind of hampered with never having tasted the actual reference fruit. Based on the second opinions down below, not at all. Definitely nothing unpleasant or out-of-place.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Ridiculously smooth. So smooth it has almost a negative throat hit, like it's actually soothing my throat.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This is a different beast entirely from TFA Dragon Fruit and they are 100% not swappable.  Just throwing that out there.  This doesn't have the weird emulsifying superpower that TFA Dragonfruit gets from the triethyl citrate.  This is much more an actual flavor with great texture as opposed to something that'll fit anywhere you put it.\n\nThis tends to sit pretty forward in a mix, and as such it's a tiny bit tricky to use if you don't want to use this as a primary note.  I'd suggest using other concentrates to supplement this, as opposed to the usual usage of TFA Dragon Fruit.  Pairs well with most tropical fruits as accents, especially mango, pineapple, and banana. I'd also suggest softer fruits like apples and pears.  Go for brighter berries like strawberry or raspberry for a contrasting note that doesn't clash.  I'm not seeing this a mixer for bakeries at all, but lighter creams without heavy buttery notes work great.\n\n**Notes:**  S&V concentration testing, this doesn't seem out of line at all for Inawera and is pretty linear. .25% is too light. Some interesting texture but very little flavor, mostly a light pineapple top note. .5% is getting some serious texture, but again a lighter flavor. 1% is dense, and that flavor is definitely filling out. Still feels just a bit unsaturated.  At 1.5%, the flavor is getting a bit sharper, with the florals picking up and giving it a pineapple candy kind of vibe on top of that dense base. At 2% the flavor is getting a bit flat, and by 2.5 the florals are bit unpleasant and the entire concentrate just stops cohering all that well.  I'd mix with this at 1.0% and work up for a primary note. I'm not sure it's worth trying this as a straight backup or supporting flavor.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nIn the comments for /u/wh1skeyk1ng/ 's [TFA Dragon Fruit](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/4q74bb/tfa_dragonfruit_flavor_review/) /u/tranceinate/ says this stuff tastes like an actual dragon fruit: \"INW Dragonfruit if you want something that actually tastes like dragonfruit, & not something that tastes like pineapple, apple, pear, & other fruits with emulsifying properties.\" Actually, there's been quite of a few mentions of this being a pretty accurate flavor including /u/BleuXShadoW/ in the comments for this post on [TFA Dragonfruit](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/2yzu93/advice_on_dragon_fruit/).\n\nGood reviews on [BCF](http://www.bullcityflavors.com/dragonfruit-concentrate-inw/) noting accurate flavor, heavy concentration, and the tendency of this flavor to push toward the front of a mix.\n\n[ELR Notes complain a lot about how floral this is, comparing it to INW Cactus quite a bit.]  I can kind of see it, but I really feel like the florals here aren't overbearing if used under 2%. I'm a cactus fanboy though, so maybe it just agrees with me a bit more than most.\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Never change, Inawera.  [Inawera describes it as: \"A mystery flavour. Our former testers didn’t have a dillema describing their opinions. For ones DRY COCKTAIL it’s a sweet, fruity tobacco. For others is a „tobacco candy” or „tobacco spiced with gingerbread.” And you what will you notice in it?\" in a forum post.](https://www.planetofthevapes.co.uk/forums/vendors/overseas-vendors/inawera/threads/4-new-flavours-from-inawera-com.89413/)  The flavor is a bit hard to describe, but I'm getting something that tastes a lot more like a really heavy anise / black licorice with a very light tobacco and a boozy fruit finish. That black licorice tobacco note reminds me quite a bit of [INW Kent](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/6mwlla/inw_kent/), although it's substantially less tobacco forward and much less sticky and rich. There does also seem to be a bit of something spicier like ginger in there but the anise-y notes are pretty dominant.  There's some very light breadiness that ends up working a lot like the starchy base of black licorice.  The fruitiness seems really generic and overripe, closest thing I can think of would be a very light apple or pear kind of note but with the licorice and caramel here that can come off as kind of a overripe booziness.  Almost comes across as kind of pear brandy for me on some drags, but then kind of falls apart into black licorice and fruit on others.  A bit airy and dry overall, but still fairly sweet.  I have no clue what you'd want to do it with this besides maybe embrace the weirdness and add a clearer tobacco or an oaky bourbon note. As an accent flavor it'll probably work more like black licorice than anything else. I'd use this around 1.5% for a primary note or a solo flavor.\n\nInhale is sweet and sharp. Some caramel sweetness but the top notes are truly odd with a licorice boozy sharp fruity vibe to it.  The fruit note tastes more like an apple or pear I guess, and my palette keeps going back and forth on how strong those boozy top notes are. Thinner inhale and kind of airy. Exhale has maybe a very light tobacco, but there's a sweeter anise and ginger note that just tastes a lot more like black licorice to me. Fruitiness comes through more on the exhale. Some of that caramel from the inhale randomly shows back up and it goes boozy towards the tail end.  Almost a cognac or pear brandy type of note to it. Sweet, but not really too sticky.  Boozy notes have a slightly unpleasant sharpness to them.  That booziness really comes and goes for me, and skews more towards black licorice a good portion of the time.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Who the hell knows? Nothing here tastes either chemical or offensive but I have no idea what this profile is supposed to be.  If it's indeed a tobacco, I feel like the tobacco here is really light.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Moderate? It's a bit dry and that fruity / boozy note seems fairly sharp and acidic.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:** This already has light tobacco, heavy spice, light bakery notes, boozy brandy, and a fruity finish.  Most things you're going to do it are going to involve boosting one of those notes.  My personal pick would be the tobacco part of this.  I do like the hint of tobacco in here, and maybe a leafy tobacco would help fill out the concentrate a bit.  I'd stay away with anything to nutty or dry, but I want to say something like FLV Cured Tobacco and play the woodier notes off the licorice here.  I also think the booziness in here would lend itself to an extra shot of something like FA Oakwood or FLV Bourbon.\n\nThis has too much anise/licorice to really crank up the bakery, and it's about as fruity as I'd want it to be. \n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, this doesn't have much definition at .25 and .5%. Light licorice and fruit more than anything else. At 1% I'm getting some booziness to the fruit, and a heavier caramel sweetness. At 1.5% it's picking up a bit of black licorice as that caramel gets stronger and the spices here solidify a bit. At 2% I feel like I'm losing some of the booziness and this feels like a black licorice forward tobacco with a fruity caramel sweetness. At 3% this is starting to feel a bit heavy and sticky, and what little booziness I'm getting feels like a sharp, overripe off note.  I'd probably stay around 1.5% assuming the boozy part of this what you're after.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  Not a ton.\n\n[Here's the inawera forum page thing with the testing notes.  Apparently the development title of this was \"Dry Tobacco\" which makes at least slightly more sense than \"Dry Cocktail.\"  User \"dara\" describes this as: \"Subtle, strong tobacco flavour with herbal-gingerbreads after taste, a volatile alcoholic taste in the background.\"  Some testers are getting a clearer tobacco than I am, user \"redwitch\" writes: \"Quite interesting tobacco flavour. Definitely the taste of tobacco is recognizable with something fruity-alcoholic after taste.\"  User \"pokoik\" writes: \"Certainly it’s a tobacco liquid. Touches of pipeish absolute are recognizable from the lowest concentration. However, the main ingredient it’s a dessert-fruity after taste. There’s a lot of sweetness, maybe even too much. However, the balance is kept and the ready liquid is vapable.\"](http://www.forum.inawera.com/viewtopic.php?f=141&t=3757&st=0&sk=t&sd=a)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**\n\nThanks to ID10-T for suggesting this for review?",

    "markdown": "##**INW Eucalyptus w/ Mint**##\n\n*Summary*  \nThis to me this is the perfect ingredient to vape when you're sick or have a sore throat. That's not to say it's not enjoyable when you're not sick, but the cooling effects from the eucalyptus and mint are a god send when you are. Although the flavoring is fairly concentrated, it's not as concentrated as some of the flavorings from INW we've come to know and love. At 1.5%, it's quite alarming right away, but after a steep of a few days - 1 week, it calms down to the perfect level of cooling for me. 0.75%-1% is great for if you need a shake-n-vape. Since it's such a different sensation, it does take a few pulls to acclimate yourself to the cooling, which I've noticed is very forward on the upper-back of the throat. Overall, it's a very accurate representation of Eucalyptus with just a touch of Mint (I get more mint than menthol).\n\n**On the Nose**  \nVery cooling, eucalyptus, slight mint note. Clears out your sinuses.\n\n**Recommended Usage**  \n*Stand alone*: 1.5-2%\n\n*In a mix*: <0.75-1.5%\n\n**Throat**  \nMild; cool.\n\n**Pairings**  \nFruits, florals, mint. \n\n**Avoid**  \nCoffee? IDK.\n\n**Steep**  \n4 days - 1 week for the cooling to calm down to a desireable level. Just bring it down a notch or two if you need something right away\n\n**Quick Recipe: Lemon & Honey Cough Drop**  \n*Ratio: 15PG/85VG*  \n*Steep: 4 days - 1 week* \n\n* INW Eucalyptus w/ Mint @ 1.5%  \n* JF Lemon Juicy @ 3%  \n* FLV Honey Bee @ 1-2 drops per 15ml (0.25%)  \n\nINW Eucalyptus w/ Mint is definitely the star here, offering a wonderful cooling sensation and enjoyable throat & vape. The lemon or other fruits here just offer a nice accent flavor that blends well with eucalyptus w/ mint so your palate doesn't get bored. JF Juicy Lemon is great since it's a fantastic lemon flavor without any unwanted throat from citric acid that other lemons offer.\n\nIf you don't have FLV Honey Bee, you can probably sub FA or TFA in its place, but I personally liked the Honey Bee. I tried it without the Honey and found it not quite as enjoyable. It offers a nice sort of floral sweetness to the mix. Honey also takes a while to steep to be enjoyable, otherwise it will just be too forward and in your face. I liked it at 2 drops in 15ml, but feel free to bring it down to 1 drop so it's not so prominent. I feel a lot of people would probably prefer at 1 drop. \n\n**Quick Recipe: Cherry Cough Drop**  \n*Ratio: 15PG/85VG*  \n*Steep: 4 days - 1 week* \n\n* INW Eucalyptus w/ Mint @ 1.5%  \n* FLV Bing Cherry @ 1.5%  \n\nI really like the FLV Bing cherry here too. It's got a sort of \"Luden's\" cherry taste to it which pairs very well in a cough drop. Feel free to try subbing your favorite cherries, berries, other fruits, etc with Eucalyptus w/ Mint to create your perfect Cough Drop",

Tobacco in the background. Not too sweet. \n\n**Off-flavors:** none\n\n**Throat hit:** 5/10. Pretty mellow. \n\n**Uses:** In the 5% range with other tobaccos around the 2% range, it adds a wonderful plum back note to the mix. In the current version of a recipe I have, I use this ratio. The shake and vape test left me a little disappointed because the plum disappeared. After four days, it came back just the right amount to give it that hint of a darker sweetness I was looking for. \n\n**Pairings:**  Tobaccos, maybe some nuts. Don't try to over complicate it though. It's already a decent flavor stand alone. I would suggest to throw in .5% Dirty Neutral Base to bring out a bit more of the smoke in \"smoked plum.\" When using as a back note in a mix, go a little higher than you usually would with your supporting cast, or you might not get the flavor to come back. I can't really speak to if it will work with fruits, as I don't have any fruits to play with. It could probably work with something that isn't \"candy sweet\" though. \n\n**Notes:** The only place I saw that carries this flavor is Wizard Labs, which may make it a compromise for some to get a hold of. I couldn't find any mention of it on here, and very limited info on it anywhere else. Very happy to have found it though. From what I could find, I think it may be a clone of a Chinese juice called Fortune Strike. Never tried it, so I can't say if it's a good clone.

It smells kinda like pepsi twist with no CO2 in it at all. Like you would open a can of pepsi and left it for half a day. There are hints of citrus fruits and some kind of sweetener I think, cause it's not that sour. It has some minty off-notes, too.\n\n**The inhale.**\n\nThe throat hit is mild progressing to a heavier hit, and the taste when inhaling reminds me of the taste of cola when taking a first sip, you know what I mean? Not fully cola-like, but you can't miss what you're drinking.\n\n\n\n**The exhale.**\n\nThroat hit at the exhale is for me not too heavy, but I definetly wouldn't call it light. It's on the heavier side and I like it, like I mentioned in, I think, pretty much all of my reviews :) \n\nAs for the taste, you know that pleasant taste when drinking cola out of the can? I can't really describe it that well, I think it has to do something with the can itself... but for me it's like that. I can tell that it's cola, but the taste reminds me more of a cheaper kinds of coke than i.e pepsi or coca-cola. \nThere are also citrus notes, some lemon in there, more like lime actually, mixed with more delicate orange off notes. I can't taste any mint in there though, as shown on the packaging.\nIt leaves a slightly sweet taste on my tounge, something like condensated cola.\n\n**Uses and pairings**: I would pair it with some lemon aromas just to see if more citrus notes can make it a bit fresher. Other than that, I would go solo with this concentrate.\n\n**Personal testing notes**: 5% and below is fine, no need to go higher. It's so much better than Capella's cherry cola, which for me tastes like antibiotics.\n\n\n**Summary:** Quite good cola flavour, but I don't think it's \"the one\" yet. For me it's worth the money and won't leave you with an unpleasant experience. Try it if you like mixing cola with lemons or citrus fruits in general.\n Any recommendations for cola-like juices? :)\n\nquestions/co-op/review propositions: mrgvape@gmail.com",

Both seems very realistic. No bakery or any similar smell present.\n\n**Testing:** More clove upfront than ginger. I can confirm that both spicies feel authentic, it gives you the right spicy note without scratching your throat out and I was surprised that it didn't feel dry at all. The big down side of this flavor is that there's no bakery notes at all, just pure ginger and clove. No off-notes present.\n\n**Pairings:** Floral profiles, tea's, bakery's and tobaccos.\n\n**Usage:** Overall I recommend this around at 0.25-0.5% since it's very concentrated. Tried at 0.75% but it started to get very dry and the clove even more upfront.\n\n**Conclusions:** There's no much to say unfortunely. It's ginger and clove. CAP Gingerbread is still my favorite and there's no comparison with this one.\n\n**More information:**http://www.inawerawinkel.com/CONCENTRATE-GINGERBREAD/1740/?i=en  \n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n**INW Miss Cream**  \nTested at: 0.5%, 1%, 2% / 2 weeks steep.\n\n**First Impressions:** One the nose I get fudge, a mild artificial vanilla mixture with heavy cream. The fudge is more prominent than the rest.\n\n**Testing:**That artificial vanilla note is messing the overall flavor. The cream is very dense to the point it makes your mouth with a 'heavy feeling', there's no dairy notes and it's way dry for my taste. Only thing I find positive is the fudge note which it's sticky and authentic. There's a dark caramel note somewhat similar to FA Caramel and a very mild dark chocolate note.\n\n**Pairings:** Custard's, bakery's and maybe tobaccos?\n\n**Usage:** Between 0.5%-1.5%. At low percentages, the vanilla is not so present which is good and allows the fudge to be more upfront. Upping the percentages, that dense cream starts to come out. I still tried to play with this with INW Custard and CAP VCv1 and the cream just messes with all.\n\n**Conclusions:** I really don't know what to do with this one. The vanilla note really messes me up.\n\n**More information:** http://www.inawerawinkel.com/CONCENTRATE-MISS-CREAM/1701/?i=en\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n**INW Rumble Crumble**  \nTested at: 2%, 3% / 2 weeks steep.\n\n**First Impressions:** On the nose, a mix of cranberry and blackcurrant, both authentic, cooked and warm.

It doesn't give me a jammy or a syrup type flavour, just a slightly cooked and warm comfort fruit. The crust/cookie/crumble note is also noticeable but only in high wattages. FA Apple Pie helps a lot here to bring more that bakery note upfront. There's a light cinnamon note too but barely present.\n\n**Pairings:**Other fruits, bakery's, custards, tea's or other floral profiles.\n\n**Usage:** Between 2-3% seems the right spot. Didn't get any off notes and overall seems balanced. The downside of this flavour is if you want to make a crumble with other kind of fruits or only the crumble part, you'll get that cranberry and blackcurrant right on your face. So it's a very limited flavour.\n\n**More information:** http://www.inawerawinkel.com/CONCENTRATE-RUMBLE-CRUMBLE/1737/?i=en\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n**INW Yes We Cheesecake**  \nTested at: 2%, 3% / 2 weeks steep.\n\n**First Impressions:** On the nose, you really get what's supposed to be. This indeed represents an authentic European cheesecake. The cream cheese? Checked. The crunchy biscuit base? Checked too!\n\n**Testing:** Starting with the base. It's present and it's combined with the body of the flavour. It's cooked perfectly and it feels like it just came out of the oven. The cream cheese filling is on point! It tastes just like the Philadelphia (brand) cream cheese. You get the cheesiness of the cream cheese but it's not gross and it doesn't muddle the complexity of the flavour.\nThe cream component complements the rest.\n\n**Pairings:** Fruits and bakery's.\n\n**Usage:** Beetween 2-3.5% seems the right spot.\n\n**Conclusions:** If you enjoy cheesecake profiles, give this a try. This stands out compared to other cheesecakes like CAP NY, LA Cheesecake or TPA Cheesecake (Graham Crust), but this one I don't consider a cheesecake, more the base of one.\n\n**More information:** http://www.inawerawinkel.com/YES-WE-CHEESECAKE/1734/?i=en\n\n**Other topics in Reddit:**\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/6swmmj/inawera_yes_we_love_cheesecake_prepremiere_test/\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/86dxdx/inw_yes_we_cheesecake/\n\nPS: Sorry if I misplaced some words but English is not my primary language.",

It is backed by a fairly thick and soft almond texture/taste, along with a hint of something citrusy and bright.  It is rather thick in the mouth with a delicate taste behind it.  I personally do not taste any whiskey, as this flavor is supposed to mimic a whiskey-amaretto cocktail.  I feel like I get mostly the amaretto part.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Occasionally, right at the end of my inhale/the beginning of my exhale, I get something resembling burnt plastic or rubber, almost like butyric acid.  It isn't every time, but it is there more than I care for it to be, and maybe 3% is bringing out the weirdness, I'm not sure.\n\n**Throat hit:** 4/10, mostly smooth but the citrus note does throw in a bit of throat hit.\n\n**Uses:** This would work well as part of a cocktail recipe or as an additive in a tobacco recipe.  I'd keep it under 3% though.  It would also probably work well to \"soften\" up a fruity or nutty recipe a bit under 1%.\n\n**Pairings:**   Tobaccos, creams, nuts, coffee, booze flavors.  \n\n**Notes:**  I really wanted to like this flavor, since I'm a huge fan of INW, but I personally can't get far enough past that occasional burnt plastic taste to make myself use it in a recipe yet.  I do think with the right additives and flavor layers it would work out fine, I just don't feel like travelling down that route quite yet.  If anyone else has ANY experience with this flavor, I'm interested.\n \n[Link to all of our flavor reviews in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)\n\n",

The tobacco carries some distinctive woodsy tones, and is complimented by a rather syrupy blend of nuts, caramel, molasses, with maybe raisins or prunes, and a slightly smokey note in the deep background.  Kind of reminds me of my days when I chewed fresh Levi Garrett from a pouch.  \n\n**Off-flavors:** Nothing to report here.\n\n**Throat hit:** 6/10 robust, yet pretty smooth\n\n**Uses:** Good as is, but would work in a blended tobacco base too.  Honestly, this flavor is pretty good after a couple days steeping.  I know it's cliche to let tobacco flavors steep a while longer than normal, but I think this one could be easily enjoyed either way, as the raisins and syrup do die down a bit after a while.\n\n**Pairings:**   I can't even imagine pairing this one with much besides other preferred tobaccos.  Maybe something that's already in it that you want to accent like nuts, caramel, maple, raisin?  \n\n**Notes:**  Due to it's complexity, I recommend to definitely try this flavoring alone before deciding what to add to it.  I'm going to bet Inawera intended this flavor to be enjoyed standalone.\n\n**Bonus Recipe**\n\nIngredient | Percentage\n---|---\nINW Gold Ducat | 3-4%\n\n[Link to all of our flavor reviews in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)\n\nEdit: Included steeping notes.",

There's something better!! Well let me change your mind, who doesn't like grapefruit slap some sugar on it and boom! It totally comes to life that citric fruit gets lifted and it takes on a completely new profile. So why not transfer this great fruit into your recipes.  \n\n\nINW grapefruit is awesome, it's totally on par with the real grapefruit. It smells lovely really bright plenty of tort, slightly sour but oh it's so Juicy and refreshing.  \n\nWhether grapefruit would get lost to some degree amongst other flavours in a recipe is I guess trial and error I can see it working with citrus fruits lemon,lime,orange,kiwi,apple but berries I'm not too sure.  \n\nDefinitely one to play with you could make this the party piece of your recipe if you choose the surrounding flavours correctly.  \n\n3% is flavoursome and I wouldn't go much higher you know it's strong just from smelling it. Definitely a great flavour should work in recipes and it's very refreshing as a Standalone go grab this and add to your arsenal.\n\n**Notes**  \n\nReal flavour, bright,sweet, tart,bitter,citric  \n\nStandalone 3-4%  \nIn a recipe0.5-2%  \n\n*Please if your opinion differs, or you have another review for this post it in the comments.

When I picked up Inawera Green Spring Tea at my local vendor, I was intrigued. It has a floral scent (which I couldn't quite put my finger on) and of course, you get the subtle undertones of matcha green tea. I did a quick Google search on my phone and found almost zero results. So I did what any sensible DIY-er would do! I grabbed a 10ml vial for science!\n\nBefore I continue, here is what their official website has to say about this flavoring:\n\n> Green Tea with Jasmine\n\nOh, so that's the floral scent I was picking up. Now as you all might know by now, I share a great affinity for green tea. I drink it every morning, and every evening, too. So I'm pretty familiar with pairings. For example, honey gives it a thick sweetness that compliments the earthiness of the tea. Or adding lemon adds a bit of zest and really brightens up the green tea.\n\nSo pairing it with something floral and delicate like jasmine should be a no-brainer, right?\n\nUnlike TFA Green Tea, this concentrate is free from any coloring. That means you get less of the dreaded coil charring and that means less coil changing. \n\n**Taste:**\n\nI'm getting nothing on the first few puffs. Oh ,wait... I think I'm picking up the subtle taste of jasmine. It's a very delicate flavor, preferring to stay in the background and let green tea take the spotlight. But that's the major problem with this flavoring. The green tea is being a shy little bitch.\n\nI was hopeful when I purchased this flavoring. I wanted my taste buds to be swept by the rich, delicate aroma of the jasmine flower. At the same time, the earthiness of the green tea could really serve to keep things grounded (no pun intended), making sure that the jasmine doesn't ever become too perfumey. \n\n**Standalone/Mixer:**\n\nAt 2%, the flavor is mild and lacking. I might consider upping the percentage to 3 or even 4%. I have to say, this flavoring is quite a disappointment considering the majority of INW's flavors are potent. \n\n**Pairings**\n\nFloral tea (needs to be reinforced with FA Jasmine), maybe green tea jasmine cake, or maybe iced green tea infused with lemon or melon for a nice refreshing vape.\n\n**Is it 4oz-worthy?**\n\nNope. It's worth a try but I feel it doesn't deserve a spot in any mixer's arsenal. Nexttttt!",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** INW Jamaican Rum @ %1, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 8 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Pink bubblegum and apple cider vinegar. Seriously. I have no idea where they were going with this, but it's like a creamy / almost chalky bazooka bubble gum right up front with some underlying apple cider vinegar funk. In no conceivable way does this actually taste like rum.  It kind of settles in after a couple ml's, but it still doesn't taste much like rum, more of a vaguely bubblegum, sour, warming taste.\n\nInhale is warm and bitter. Some chalky pink bubblegum flavor and a moderate density. Acidic tang in there as well, building as the exhale warms up. Exhale has that chalky bubblegum right up front, with some higher clove top notes. Their is an acidity that tastes exactly like apple cider vinegar underneath it all.  Some light brown sugar kind of sweetness, but with that sour note the overall concentrate is pretty astringent. Moderatly dense overall, but distinctly warm.  This may be the only saving grace of this concentrate, it has a very real warming effect.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Everything? I'm going to say everything.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  For as much of a mess as this is, at least it's not harsh? Has a distinct warming effect though.  Present on inhale and the exhale, and it does that thing where it seems to kind of spread out from your chest like actual booze does. It's certainly interesting.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Eh, not really? I can't see using this for any specific part of the flavor because the rest of it is just so damn weird.  Doesn't really taste like rum, too weird to use that bubblegum note, and too fruity to use the sour anywhere.  It is warm though, so maybe a tiny percentage to warm up a pretty heavily flavored recipe? I don't know, I'm grasping at straws here.  This stuff is rough.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nS&V concentration testing, at .25% I get mostly chalky bubblegum with some of that warm effect. Still just a hint of that vinegar acidity there. .5% is a lot more sour, with that vinegar starting to take over. 1% is definitely fuller bordering on chalky, but still sour and with a strong bubblegum note. 1.5% really has those clove notes picking up and the warmth becoming a defining characteristic. Just for laughs, 3% tastes more like a clove flavor than anything else. Still sour, but really clove forward.\n\nI had originally ordered this from ECX and it looks like they dropped it. I'm sort of at a loss here.  To me, this tastes nothing like rum, and I've really got no use for a vinegar-bubble gum flavor. Maybe I got a bad batch or whatever, but I have no clue why this is a thing.  I tend to hoard even bad flavors, but I honestly don't think I'm ever going to use this.  If you have more positive experiences, please share.  It feels like I'm missing something here.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n/u/tranceinate/ in this [post on INW Alcohol flavors](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/3nd9d6/anyone_tried_inawera_alcohol_flavors/), says: \"It's an interesting rum. I've only used it a little bit. It's got a lot going on to it.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** INW Kent, 1.5 and 3%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 23 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Caramel forward pipe tobacco with a black licorice finish.  Caramel is pretty intense, more of a softer caramel chew or sauce flavor rather than a dry hard caramel. Tobacco here isn't dry and nuttier like I'd expect from more of a cigarette or shag flavor, more of a deep, slightly moist pipe tobacco with some earthy notes. Finish is interesting, with those earthy green notes from the tobacco shifting more into a black licorice. Caramel sweetness and body carries through the entire vape putting this firmly into a candy black licorice as opposed to thinner, brighter anise.  Picks up some roasted coffee on the very tail end but I'm thinking that might be the coil gore catching up a bit.  No ash in here, and a little light on recognizable tobacco. Use is going to be interesting, I pretty much just want to fill this out a bit with a drier, nutty shag would help to lighten this up and bump up the tobacco character a bit.  I'd use at 2.5% solo, and maybe 1.25-1.75% in a blend depending on how much sweetness you'd like out of the finished product.\n\nInhale is pretty heavily sweet and dense with that soft caramel right up front. Sweeter base flavor, not really fruity but with a deep vegetal note.  Exhale is complex. Caramel up front, still soft, still intensely sweet. Actual tobacco starts to come through on the back half of the exhale. Tobacco itself tastes more like the moister, dark flavors I associate with pipe tobacco. Slightly green flavor on the tobacco, but a really dark green.  Almost tastes herbal, like a syrupy green tea. Black licorice and roasted coffee on the tail end of the exhale. Not a strong anise character, but almost a molasses based black licorice candy. Roasted coffee seems to be a mixture of coil gore and the tail end of those green tobacco notes.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  I have no clue what a \"kent\" tobacco is supposed to taste like, but nothing unpleasant.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light, nothing major. \n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  It's a really interesting concentrate and really not that bad as a solo vape.  If you like your tobacco sweet and you don't mind that black licorice on the back end, you could definitely do worse.\n\nI'm still on the new side to actually pairing tobaccos, but this seems pretty wide open in terms of pairing other tobaccos to bring out whatever characteristics.  I'd definitely stay away from anything sweet, because this feels almost oversweet by itself.\n\nThere's some greeness to this that may be exacerbated (in a good or bad way, depending on your preference) when mixed with something like a Cavendish or Black for Pipe.  Seems like it would take some spice notes pretty well if you want to get more aromatic.\n\nI'd personally go with a dryer, nutty, or even slightly ashy tobacco to fill this out.  Using a more neutral tobacco as a base is going to help keep this from getting cloying.  If you want any kind of ash in here, I'd stick with blending with another tobacco with an ash note.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing with a longer steeping tobacco is a bit tricky. I will say this feels a little thin at 1.5%.  I'm still getting some raw base flavor. At 3%, this feels a lot more full, but it's getting cloyingly sweet and sticky. I'd probably suggest using this around 2.5%.\n\nVery dark concentrate and a bit thick and sticky. I'm noticing a bit of coil gore, and it's definitely a bit hard on the wicks. I'd anticipate having to rewick a bit more than usual.\n\nSteeping, seems to come together around 2 weeks. All that sweetness is there early, but that earthy tobacco note starts to develop about a week out. I didn't notice a huge difference between this at 2 and 3 weeks.\n\nI'm also not 100% sure on availability for this. I can't find it on Inawera's website, but their website is a bit of a dumpster fire. It's part of the Wera Garden line, and it's at least still available on Chef's. \n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Review on Planet of the Vapes from user \"RedV\", in summary: \"First test and it was a very strong! Huge liquorice flavour with hint of malt and caramel. No real discernible tobacco. My mix was quite strong but really satisfying, you could up the concentrate levels to get more of the liquorice flavour through, As after a few days rest the liquorice is only very slight. It now has a very creamy/malty caramel taste with a liquorice undertone.\"](https://www.planetofthevapes.co.uk/forums/product-reviews/flavour-concentrate-reviews/tobaccos/threads/kent-wera-garden-inawera.20221/)\n\n[Youtube review, mostly noting the caramel and licorice.

This is my first actual flavor review, so if you have any questions or think I should have added something, please let me know!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSetup: Wasp Nano, Nichrome Alien at .3 ohms , organic japanese cotton wick\n\nTesting: Inawera Kiwi @ 2%, 5%, and 8% steeped 1 day and 1 week (3% nicotine for all)\n\nFlavor Description: \n\n⦁\tDay 1 at 2%, I get a faint sweet kiwi that is fairly authentic. When I bumped the percentage up to 5, it startied tasting a bit more on the candy side. Still not that overpowering. Initial reaction is that this would be good as a offnote, but would easily get overpowered. Likely pairs well with other tropical fruits. The sweetness is still there which may be good for people who are looking for sweetness but do not want to add any actual sweeteners. 8% did pretty much what I expected. Same thing as 2% to 5% except more intense; I am getting a lot more candy than authentic kiwi now. Barely any throat hit even at 8%.\n\n⦁\tAt one week not a whole lot has changed across the board. 2% is still a really nice sweet kiwi. 5% and 8% still have a nice flavor to them, they just became more candy-like.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPairings: I think this one is pretty straight forward. I think at low percentages, INW Kiwi could add sweetness and another fruit to tropical vapes. I also think this would go very nicely with a yogurt or cream base as well.",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** INW Lemon @ 1%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 13 days\n\n**Flavor Description:** Bright, tart, moderately sweet candy lemon instead of a lemon juice or actual lemon flavor. Not quite as thick and sweet as FA Lemon Sicily, but very much in the same vein. No creamier undertones like JF Juicy Lemon either.  I don't get a lemon pledge or cleaning product kind of vibe from this at all, which can be a problem with stronger citruses that don't have a ton of body.\n\nInhale is all lemon deep candy sweetness. No real zest here. Moderately dense but a building kind of sharp tartness. Exhale has a softer lemon candy flavor. Fairly bright, dense but no hint of any cream or anything like that.  Definitely a candy sweetness, but not too sugary.  Really light zest top notes but those accent the candy flavor as opposed to taking over.  No lingering astringency or weird top notes, mostly a little bit of rawness in the mouth and a bit of a bit of a sugary mouthfeel.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Nope. It's a fairly strong lemon flavor but at a reasonable percentage there is nothing that skews toward astringent or cleaning products.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Pretty light. It's a strong citrus flavor, but it's fairly smooth all things considered.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This flavor should fit in where you need a tart candy lemon type of flavor, but all of the other options are just too sweet. The tartness here is really cool, and something that doesn't really show up in the sweeter candy lemon concentrates.\n\nSeems like the best use would be lemon bakeries and creams where you want to have a flatter, more savory base that isn't just straight sugar. I think it'd go well imparting good lemon flavor in like a cheesecake or milkshake\n\nThis gets a good amount of play in lemonade flavors, specifically because it has some of the tartness you get with sweetened lemons, but still manages to avoid being oversweet or too heavy.  Seems like a good lemon for sweet tea as well.  This still gets a bit too sweet for my tastes at higher percentages, but it's definitely more nuanced than some of your other options.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nNot quite as strong as you'd expect from a lemon flavor from inawera. Not weak by any means, but you can get over 1% without completely destroying your sinuses and throat. S&V Concentration testing, At .25% I get a lighter tartness. At .5% there is some sweetness, but the lemon flavor is feeling a bit thin. 1% is good, with some balanced sweetness and a bit of a sharper lemon tartness.  Solo at least, 1.5% seems to be the sweet spot here. I get a full sweetness, some balanced tartness, and a nice clear flavor.  After that the sweetness takes off at the expense of the more nuanced tart lemon. 2% seems distinctly sweet to me and by 3% I'm getting a more straight ahead lemon candy flavor like Lemon Sicily.  Personally, I'd mix with this starting at .75% in accent roles with other fruits around, and maybe push to 1.5% and work up for stronger lemon bakeries and creams. I know this gets used higher (*cough ID10-T*) but  I think at higher percentages it works more as a candy lemon sweetner than a good standalone lemon flavor. \n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nPlenty of talk about this in the sub, just no flavor review.\n\n[Really good discussion of how this stuff works in the INW Lemon Mix Review.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/5bbkgn/flavor_review_inw_lemon_mix/)  Among the most salient points:\n\n\"INW Lemon 3% works great as the main flavor in a lemonade recipe but I wouldn't recommend using it that high otherwise because it would overpower other concentrates. However, it's only about half as strong as Lemon Mix. At 3% you don't get that perfume quality you get when you make the mistake of using just a little too much of many INW flavors. Also no lemon Pledge taste like you get at higher percentages of other lemons. Throat hit is present, as you would expect from a citrus, but not excessive: INW Lemon has less throat hit than an equal amount of Lemon Mix. The sweetness almost gets into lemon candy territory, though, and it is missing that lovely, slightly bitter note that Lemon Mix has. It's flatter, too sweet, and less natural-tasting without being backed up by some Lemon Mix.\" -/u/ID10-T/\n\n[In an older FOTW Lemon Post, /u/botboy141/ adds \"Lemon Concentrate is a strong, slightly sweet, candy-like lemon but without the lemon pledge quality of many others.\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/3amace/flavor_of_the_week_lemon/)\n\n[Here's your ELR Page.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/2285) Mostly postive about strength and accuracy, although a couple complaints about a soapy taste.\n\n[And the BCF Page, because why not.](http://www.bullcityflavors.com/lemon-concentrate-inw/)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

More of a lemon extract flavor as would be appropriate with cooking or baking. I am having a hard time describing the bakery/cake part of the flavor. Below the sweet lemon is an easily recognizable pound cake flavor although it's missing the density or heaviness, yet it still checks the buttery and richness box in both texture and flavor. But I'm also getting a slight bitterness or off flavor that is hard to describe. It reminds me of a cake, biscuit, or bread where someone added just a touch too much baking powder. Almost like a light hint of floury like bitterness you get with too much baking powder? That doesn't extend into the body and mouthfeel of it though, it actually has a great moistness to the cake. The ratios of cake to fruit is rather good with the cake being slightly more prominent than the lemon, and the lemon melds into the cake for a more complex full cake flavor rather than sitting on top of it.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:** Something I can't recognize? Similar to a baked good with too much baking powder if you've ever had one.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit:** 3/10\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Uses:** Bakeries. Cakes, pies, muffins, danishes, ice cream or shakes.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Notes:** After reading others comments on the strength of this flavor, I started with 1.5%. It's a medium strength here, I've used it up to 2% for the main note, but I haven't tried it higher as I'm afraid that off note will become offensive. I have made recipes using this in the .75-1.5% range and it has made really good cakes, custard, and pies without the off taste. I'm not sure what magic happens, but that strange note completely disappears with additional flavors. I won't use it single flavor due to that, but it's become integral to my lemon bakeries.\n\nThis is my favorite attempt so far:\n\nLemon Poundcake w/Cream Cheese Icing:\n\n 1.50% Butter (CAP)   \n 1.50% Cream Cheese Icing (LA)   \n 3.00% Lemon (FE)   \n 2.00% Lemon Cake (INAWERA)   \n 1.00% Meringue (FA)   \n 3.00%  Simply Cake (Purilum)   \n\nFlavor total: 12%\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Other opinions:** From RedDread1973 on Reddit:\nOrdered this because it was recommended to me by someone that works at the DIY shop I order from. (/u/FunkMast3r)\n\nI will state that I am not a fan of lemon anything, in food or vaping. I don't hate it but it's not really my thing.\n\nSmell - This smells exactly like a lemon pound cake. I mean exactly. Buttery, Lemony and cakey.\n\nTaste - As a shake n vape it's unbelievable. Extremely complex. Layered with the same notes as what you smell. Butterry, Cakey, lemony goodness. This is not an overpowering Lemon/Pledge flavour. It's present but subtle on the exhale. The cake notes are there on both the inhale and the exhale but again not overpowering the lemon. The butter is present on the inhale but again very well balanced.\n\nThis is by far the best single flavour I have ever used. (I have about 200 flavours right now). I will be playing with adding other fruits to see how they mix with it as I can see the subtle citrus from the lemon helping brighten some difficult flavours like blueberry.\n\nNow for the mix:\n\nINW - Lemon Cake 3%\nDW - 2% (Distilled Water)\n3mg/Nic (100% VG)\n95% VG\nWow! This is one that will be very versatile in the bakery mixes.",

Reminds me of the lemon juice you add to coke or water. Fresh, sour, very juicy, slightly bitter and a tad watery. Not sweet but not completely dry in sweetness.\n\n**Off flavors:** Very harsh and bitter aftertaste when vaping with almost dried out wicks. No off flavors with wet wicks.\n\n**Throat hit:** 4/10 moderate, rather smooth for a citrus flavoring.\n\n**Pairings:** Drinks, fruits, candies and other citruses. Excellent lemon/grapefruit base for alcoholic beverages.\n\n**Notes:** I was impressed with this one when I first tried it, one of the better citrus flavorings I've tried so far. It's fairly similar to FA Lemon Sicily, but lacks pithy note I get from it at over 0,5%, and doesn't have nearly as much of throat hit. Though I haven't messed with this flavoring much yet, mixing it with INW Lemon and a bit of sucralose gave me a promising start for a sour lemon candy recipe. Good mixing range would probably be at 0,5-1,5%; it's pretty strong stuff and likely overpowers more subtle notes in your mix.\n\n(This is my first post to this sub and I'm not used to reddit's formatting.

    "markdown": "**Setup:** Recoil w/ flavor barrel, Dual 15 wrap 26g 3mm Nifethal 70 coils @.17 ohms.  60w power, 450F temp limit. Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** INW Lime @ %1, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 15 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  This may well be a lime for all seasons. Solid but not overwhelming zest note, bright sweet lime, and no real cleaning product vibe. Somwhere in between the realistic and zest-heavy FA Lime Cold-Press and the neon green FLV Lime but more balanced than either. This actually might be a better key lime flavor than TFA Key Lime, with a slightly creamy finish and a pretty balanced sweet to tart ratio.\n\nInhale is mostly sharp lime zest right up front.  Exhale opens up with a softer, slightly sweetened but still very tart lime juice and fairly realistic lime zest. Moderately dense exhale, with just some pretty manageable citrus harshness. That lime note starts to really smooth out towards the back of the exhale and I get a much smoother lime flavor with just a bit of a vanilla creaminess towards the tail end of the finish, like a lime sherbet.  Some lingering lime zest bitterness.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  If you really push it, you can a bit of the sharp lysol vibe, but no real off-flavors at usable percentages.  I also get just a hint of creaminess right towards the back end. Not unpleasant by any stretch of the imagination, but not quite in profile for just a straight lime.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  There's a light to moderate throat hit there, but it's pretty mellow for a strong, bright, citrus.  Definitely doable without anything else in the mix to specifically mellow the throat hit.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  So this is my favorite lime for fruit mixes.  I think it has the right balance of tartness, brightness, and sweetness to work really well with just about anything on the fruit side of things.  It's also not a harsh flavor, so you have a good deal of latitude in what you pair it with. I mean, this and peach would still be a bit intense, but other than anything noticeably harsh you should be fine.\n\nI really like the way this smooths out towards the end.  This should be a solid bakery lime, especially for key lime pies and the like. You get enough realism to really push the profile, but it's manageable and smooth enough to work fairly well with creams or custards.\n\nI'm having a harder time thinking of a lime recipe where this would be well and truly out of place. I think for beverage vapes, the fizzier FA Lime Distilled is probably a better match, and FA Aurora does a much better job at working like a citrus twist.\n\n**Notes:** S&V concentration testing, this is definitely on the strong side. I get a pretty clear lime at .25%.  Not terribly sweet, and the lime zest is relatively heavy. .5% is fuller, bringing more sweetness and body, but with a bit more harshness. By 1%, this is pretty well maxed out. I'm picking up more of that creamy finish, but the lime is about as high it can go without tasting too astringent. At 1.5%, I feel like this is too strong to be pleasant. For fruitier mixes, I'd start with this down at .25% and work up.  For bakeries I'd start at .5%. If you have a really creamy base, you may get away with 1% comfortably and work up from there.\n\nSo tastes will definitely vary, but I love this stuff.  I like how it takes some of the more palatable aspects of available lime flavors and mashes them up without being super harsh or candied.  I've described it before like a really fancy kind of snow-cone syrup. It's not just unsweetened lime but it has a body and nuance that is really interesting next to a candy lime.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[So it looks like most of the inawera notes on ELR are copied from user \"aurora-oblivion\" on ECF.  Here's the original post.](https://www.e-cigarette-forum.com/forum/threads/inawera-flavor-review-45-flavors-from-inawerashop-add-yours-too.546838/)\n\nINW Lime Notes:\n\n\"... WOW, now that's a lime!! I can't get over how bright and \"limey\" this is, now that sounds like something the good Doctor (Who) would say after taking a vape! The lime starts bold and stays there!

Smells like concentrated limes with a strong, like really strong graham tone. Like you'd have a really dark, almost burnt graham cookie and covered it with lime juice. There is also a slight custard aftertone. It's pleasant.\n\n\nThe throat hit is quite on the heavier side on the inhale (and on the exhale), but I like it.\n\nAs for the taste, it's something different from what I've been trying to this point. I wouldn't think that a combination of dark, heavy cookies and limes would be good for me, but as it turns out, it's quite alright! There main flavor is of course the lime, but it's not overwhelming. Then the cookies hit you, but do not think that you will instantly recognize them here. They mix with limes well in this -  I don't know how to put it right - the taste of cookies is wrapped around the lime taste. I would say that it has become my daily vape also.\n\n**Uses and pairings:** I wouldn't pair it with anything. Maybe I'd try to mix it with some custardy-creamy concentrates, but haven't tried yet.\n\n**Personal testing notes**: 5% and below is fine, no need to go higher. Steeping decreases the throat hit a lot.\n\n**Summary:** Pretty good concentrate, but I don't think it's for everyone. Some of you will say it's shit, some that it's great. It's quite unusual I would say, but if you like the tastes that I described, you can try it.\n\n**Questions**: DM @unodosvape on instagram or mrgvape@gmail.com",

    "markdown": "Knowing that anise and licorice are one of those lesser used - and also enjoyed flavors, u/isuamadog and yours truly set out sail to try a few of them and share our notes with you.\n\nThey might be useful to someone out there.\n\nHence, this is not classified as a flavor review, but more of guidelines.\n\nWe tested the following:\n\n* TFA Horehound\n* INW Lukrecja (INW Liquorice)\n* MB Anise Star\n* FA Anise\n* TFA Absinthe\n\n**Horehound**:\n\nWe started this at 1% and neither of us picked up a whole lot of flavor, other than some menthol - this was around 55w to 60w. Along the menthol, we detected weak notes of caramel some anise. The one that stood out was really the menthol.\n\nWe bumped it up to 1.5% and oh dear... The menthol packs a punch at that point and we started to detect more fruity notes here - sort of citrusy notes.\n\nIt's very light on the licorice, hence we can see this being used for many other things than just a licorice.\n\nu/isuamadog mentioned it could work well in a citrus soda as an example.\n\nSuggested starting point of this in a mix would be 0.25-0.5% and go from there.\n\nWe probably wouldn't pair this up against bakeries and tobaccos, but anything else it can definitely work with, as it does have many nuances to it.\n\nu/ediblemalfunction made a [Ricola style candy](http://alltheflavors.com/recipes/77359#alpine_drops_by_ediblemalfunction) using it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**INW Lukrecja (INW Liquorice)**:\n\nWe solo tested this at 1% and the flavor here surprised us.At first, it was SUPER weird - It's a typical case of you reading the label and expect a flavor, but you're getting something else. Typically, that's a bad thing, but in this case it was a very positive experience.\n\nThe flavor here has nothing to do with licorice - not in the sense of anise or salmiak at least. It does have tones of it, kinda like VT Fig, but the flavor for this one is almost a spot on spiced prune.\n\nIt does lack some throat hit and that spice is hard to detect what is - but it's there.\n\nThe spice comes with some smoked notes as well plus it has a very delightful round texture.\n\nu/isuamadog said and I quote: \"almost smoked, like you took a prune and toasted it on the grill\".\n\nWhat makes this one really unique is the almost jelly-ish body it has. It's sweet, but not sweet as a candy - natural sweetness would be the correct term.\n\nPairings for this would definitely be bakeries and tobaccos and definitely with other licorice flavors as well - such as FA Black Touch.\n\nCan also be used with darker fruits - but should probably be kept away from the more brighter fruits.\n\nIn a mix, this can probably be used anywhere from 0.25-1%.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**MB Anise Star**:\n\nStarted this at 1% and before we even tried it, we noticed it had a very weak smell.\n\nBased on that, we already from the begining bumped it up to 1.5%.\n\nNo licorice flavor this one at all. What we could detect was what the label says - Anise star spice. But also comes with extra added sweetness, that kinda made it a little weird.\n\nWe agreed, that this flavor is what FLV Root Beer is missing.\n\nAfter that, we found our big boy pants and bumped it up to 3% just to see what would happen.\n\nSurprisingly little actually. Not much changed in the flavor, with the exception that a minor of the sweetness went away and the anise appeared a little brighter. Although, the anise was also accompanied by a terrible off-note of a metallic taste which was not pleasant at all.\n\nThat combined gives you a super weird after-taste, that doesn't really sit well with anything.\n\nPairings for this would again be beverages or teas. There are nothing about this flavor that we can see being used for anything but those.\n\nKeep it low in a mix - 0.25-0.5%.\n\nThis was by far our least likeable of the tests we did.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**FA Anise**:\n\nStarting off at 1% as per usual by now.\n\nThe smell of this - ooooh snap, it's delicious! It's a straight up anise as promised, but it also comes with an incredible good tasting under-note that almost has a \"saltiness\" to it.\n\nEven at 1%, this packs a punch of flavor - so the category here is your typical FA flavor that works brilliant in lower percentages.\n\nThe notes in this are sharp and adds edge, but not in an uncomfortable way. This would have the ability to bend a mix and make it different.\n\nIt's rich and full in flavor, but it also stops in flavor quickly - meaning, the flavor is there and the next second, it gone again. This is one of those flavors that could work very well with CAP Licorice, as it does add what the CAP Licorice tend to be missing to make it a pure full licorice.\n\nThe background notes it comes with is very similiar to those notes you'd find in your typical Scandinavian licorice candy, which is very good.\n\nSweet, salty and full - in that order. And it brings that very delicious \"zing\" that makes flavors really pop.\n\nParings for this one is a bit of a broad term. It can work very well in candies, but also in spiced and floral mixes, beverages, tobaccos - maybe not so much in bakeries, but I'm sure someone will make that work too. All around, we can almost see this work with anything - except bright fruits, no!\n\nIn a mix it's a 0.3-0.5% type - higher than that and it would take over and bully anything you'd pair it with.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TFA Absinthe**:\n\nWe'll be honest with you. This one terrified us before we even started, but none the less; big boy pants out and on and we hit it straight off at 5%.\n\nTo start out, the smell of this is straight up absinthe - no more, no less.Taste-wise, we have probably never come across a single flavor that had this many nuances as TFA Absinthe does. One moment it's sweet, the next it gets weird and finally it bitter and delicious. All three stages lingers in your mouth at the same time at the end.\n\nWeird taste, but so seriously delicious.\n\nAs many other salmiak based (and I do believe this is salmiak based, not anise), TFA Absinthe comes with a tongue-numbing \"zing\" to it. Some like it, some don't. For u/isuamadog and I it's a win.\n\nThe sweetness this flavor comes with is very welcoming and it does blend in well with the salmiak the licorice in it comes with.\n\nParings for this one would be booze, as it does lack the boozy vibe to it. Maybe some whiskey or gin - whatever booze floats your boat and does it for you.\n\nThere are a good amount of recipes on ATF for this one, ranging everywhere from candy to beverages, hell even a fruit mixture as well.\n\nIn a mix, this would probably do its best around 2-3%.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat was pretty much what we had for you. We apologize, that we didn't add in the hardware used, but there were two of us after all. We do hope, that someone will find this information useful, should they want to jump into a darker rabbit hole.\n\n[**DIY\\_eJuice Flavor Reviews**](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)",

I'll probably try it along side FA Black Fire and see how that goes. \n\n**Notes:** All the notes I have on it are included above.

I think this could be used to elevate cereal flavors that don't quite seem to hit the mark on the milk. This flavor in combinations with cream bases really helps pull together a convincing \"milk\" profile. I never understood why FW Hazelnut was always added to cereal flavorings, I thought it imparted a strange taste that took the vape away from a convincing milk profile. Try INW Marzipan in cereal or milky recipes instead.\n\nIn addition, I think this flavor in combination with FA Almond is just divine.

Definitely tastes the most like a [canary melon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canary_melon) than any other type of melon that comes to mind. No rind to speak of and is quite juicy on the inhale and exhale.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Not much at 1%; however, I plan on upping the percentage to 2% to see if this changed. Can be a bit cloying/candy-like if dripped too heavily/vaped for an extended period.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Minuscule throat hit, but could be due to lack of steeping. \n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I would be happy to vape this as a single flavor in the 1-2% range if dripping. Might need to up the percentage a tad if using a tank (maybe 2.5%), but the sweetness might also increase. \n\nAs far as pairings go, subbing/adding this into melon mixes could help add juiciness as well as a bit of sweetness to drier/rind-ish tasting melon flavors. From personal experience, it goes very well with FA Kiwi and INW Cactus (shameless personal recipe plug, [\"Mellow Kiwi\"](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/recipe/1128162/Mellow%20Kiwi)). \n\n**Notes:**\n\nS&V concentration testing: \n\n*  1% is an extremely enjoyable lighter canary melon flavor when dripped. A bit airy, but very low sweetness/candy.\n\n* 2% is sweet, with almost no rind to speak of. Full on canary melon flesh when dripped. Pleasantly juicy as well. This would be my choice as a stand alone percentage.\n\n* 3% smell becomes pretty intense and has a slight sharp peppery note to it (kind of off putting in other words). Taste is candy-like and almost overly ripe. Honey dew is definitely coming through and the flavor seems a bit heavy. Still no throat hit and I wouldn't mind this as a stand alone at all if using a tank.

Both seems very realistic. No bakery or any similar smell present.\n\n**Testing:** More clove upfront than ginger. I can confirm that both spicies feel authentic, it gives you the right spicy note without scratching your throat out and I was surprised that it didn't feel dry at all. The big down side of this flavor is that there's no bakery notes at all, just pure ginger and clove. No off-notes present.\n\n**Pairings:** Floral profiles, tea's, bakery's and tobaccos.\n\n**Usage:** Overall I recommend this around at 0.25-0.5% since it's very concentrated. Tried at 0.75% but it started to get very dry and the clove even more upfront.\n\n**Conclusions:** There's no much to say unfortunely. It's ginger and clove. CAP Gingerbread is still my favorite and there's no comparison with this one.\n\n**More information:**http://www.inawerawinkel.com/CONCENTRATE-GINGERBREAD/1740/?i=en  \n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n**INW Miss Cream**  \nTested at: 0.5%, 1%, 2% / 2 weeks steep.\n\n**First Impressions:** One the nose I get fudge, a mild artificial vanilla mixture with heavy cream. The fudge is more prominent than the rest.\n\n**Testing:**That artificial vanilla note is messing the overall flavor. The cream is very dense to the point it makes your mouth with a 'heavy feeling', there's no dairy notes and it's way dry for my taste. Only thing I find positive is the fudge note which it's sticky and authentic. There's a dark caramel note somewhat similar to FA Caramel and a very mild dark chocolate note.\n\n**Pairings:** Custard's, bakery's and maybe tobaccos?\n\n**Usage:** Between 0.5%-1.5%. At low percentages, the vanilla is not so present which is good and allows the fudge to be more upfront. Upping the percentages, that dense cream starts to come out. I still tried to play with this with INW Custard and CAP VCv1 and the cream just messes with all.\n\n**Conclusions:** I really don't know what to do with this one. The vanilla note really messes me up.\n\n**More information:** http://www.inawerawinkel.com/CONCENTRATE-MISS-CREAM/1701/?i=en\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n**INW Rumble Crumble**  \nTested at: 2%, 3% / 2 weeks steep.\n\n**First Impressions:** On the nose, a mix of cranberry and blackcurrant, both authentic, cooked and warm. Not jammy. I get some kind of a baked cookie note too.\n\n**Testing:** Just like my first impressions, both the cranberry and the blackcurrant creates a beautiful bond. It doesn't give me a jammy or a syrup type flavour, just a slightly cooked and warm comfort fruit. The crust/cookie/crumble note is also noticeable but only in high wattages. FA Apple Pie helps a lot here to bring more that bakery note upfront. There's a light cinnamon note too but barely present.\n\n**Pairings:**Other fruits, bakery's, custards, tea's or other floral profiles.\n\n**Usage:** Between 2-3% seems the right spot. Didn't get any off notes and overall seems balanced. The downside of this flavour is if you want to make a crumble with other kind of fruits or only the crumble part, you'll get that cranberry and blackcurrant right on your face. So it's a very limited flavour.\n\n**More information:** http://www.inawerawinkel.com/CONCENTRATE-RUMBLE-CRUMBLE/1737/?i=en\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n**INW Yes We Cheesecake**  \nTested at: 2%, 3% / 2 weeks steep.\n\n**First Impressions:** On the nose, you really get what's supposed to be. This indeed represents an authentic European cheesecake. The cream cheese? Checked. The crunchy biscuit base? Checked too!\n\n**Testing:** Starting with the base. It's present and it's combined with the body of the flavour. It's cooked perfectly and it feels like it just came out of the oven. The cream cheese filling is on point! It tastes just like the Philadelphia (brand) cream cheese. You get the cheesiness of the cream cheese but it's not gross and it doesn't muddle the complexity of the flavour.\nThe cream component complements the rest.\n\n**Pairings:** Fruits and bakery's.\n\n**Usage:** Beetween 2-3.5% seems the right spot.\n\n**Conclusions:** If you enjoy cheesecake profiles, give this a try. This stands out compared to other cheesecakes like CAP NY, LA Cheesecake or TPA Cheesecake (Graham Crust), but this one I don't consider a cheesecake, more the base of one.\n\n**More information:** http://www.inawerawinkel.com/YES-WE-CHEESECAKE/1734/?i=en\n\n**Other topics in Reddit:**\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/6swmmj/inawera_yes_we_love_cheesecake_prepremiere_test/\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/86dxdx/inw_yes_we_cheesecake/\n\nPS: Sorry if I misplaced some words but English is not my primary language.",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** INW Mix Mint @ .5%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 11 days\n\n**Flavor Description:**  A fairly potent mint without a whole lot of body. I get mostly peppermint out of this, but without an overwhelming candy-cane kind of sweetness.  They call it a mixed mint, but I'm not getting a ton of spearmint in here.  Maybe just a hit of greener spearmint towards the back end of the exhale.  Moderately mentholated, with some strong peppermint flavor beyond just the menthol coolness.\n\nInhale is icy cool with a lighter body.  Some sharper straight menthol notes in there, but not a lot of actual flavor. Exhale is really smooth. Smooth peppermint right up front. Some higher, sharper spearmint on the tail end of the exhale.  Minimal sweetness here, just enough to keep the vape smooth and round out the sharper mint. Light mouthfeel overall, without much body. Menthol is relatively subtle on the exhale, pretty well balanced overall. I'm not getting anything too creamy, or any kind of vanila here, so it stays away from the tic-tac thing.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Nothing weird.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Nah, i mean theres some menthol in here, but that's kind of what you want.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This seems like a good jumping-off point for roll-your-own peppermint flavors. Since this is thinner without a ton of sweetness or body, you get to bring your own cream and sweetness to the party.  The straight menthol here is light enough that you'll be able to mix this lighter creams and thicker vanillas without anything getting too weird.  Sort of the same vein, a good base for a punchier creme-de-menthe as well as mixing with chocolates.\n\nThis is also thin enough to work in tea flavors, either black or green, for all of your relaxing peppermint tea needs.\n\nWith fruits and stuff, this'll work like CAP Cool Mint's slightly angrier sibling. Good way to add a softer peppermint flavor to brighter fruit flavors like melons, apple, strawberries, and kiwi.  I personally don't dig peppermint and darker or tropical-ish fruits, but thats on you.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration-wise, this is fairly potent. For fruit mixes and non-peppermint forward juices, I'd really just start at 1 drop per 30 ml and work up. Something like .1%.  If you're looking for something peppermint-forward, this stuff is relatively linear. I get a strong peppermint at .25% and it's pretty overbearing by 1%. I'd just work up from that .25% and adjust to taste.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Here is the ELR Page.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/3356) Repackaged notes about this not being too menthol-heavy or sweet.\n\n[Here is an older FOTW on Mint.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/3vt31w/flavor_of_the_week_mint/) Includes a quick breakdown of the INW Mints.\n\n[And here's a couple of decent reviews on BCF.](http://www.bullcityflavors.com/mix-mint-inw/)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** INW Mocha @ %2, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 14 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Pretty dead-on to something like a McDonald's mocha. Chocolate forward, without being overwhelmingly chalky. Really good coffee note, if a bit light. This tastes more like a really good hot chocolate concentrate to me, but I like my coffee pretty punchy.  Maybe a tiny bit of a dairy note, but mostly just a thick creaminess.  Sweetness is subtle, letting the more nuanced parts of the chocolate here shine through.\n\nInhale is moderately dense, without a lot of sweetness.  Flavor on the inhale is a bit weird and hard to place. Almost a drier, chalky, sharp tobacco flavor.  Exhale is a lot better, with a hot chocolate base and some higher coffee top notes.  Those coffee notes taste a little weak but super warm, like drinking weak drip coffee.  Smooths out a bit and I get maybe just a hint of a thinner cream in the back end of the exhale. Finishes relatively clean, with just a bit of lingering dark chocolate bitterness.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Not really, and that's awesome.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Light. Not exactly silky smooth, but good for a coffee.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  So this stuff is probably more remarkable for how it doesn't taste. It doesn't have a lot of the off-flavors that I associate with both chocolates and coffees. I doesn't really have that chalky tootsie-roll kind of chocolate note (at least on the exhale), and it doesn't have that darker, buttery, burnt note you can get with most coffee flavors.  Really mellow actually, and it should be a great mixer.\n\nI think this would be a great component in a tiramisu kind of bakery. No particular part of this too sharp or prominent and it will work well with a cake base. Should blend really well with custards, creams, and even ice creams.\n\nI'd also put if forward for tobacco mixes.  I talk it about it a lot, but FLV Red Burley seems like a natural fit.  I don't know enough tobaccos to recommend much outside of that, but warmer tobaccos with nutty or cocoa notes are going to go really well with this.\n\nI wouldn't have necessarily thought of mixing fruit and mocca, but /u/RuntDastardly does this to good effect in their [Fig Lebowski](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/23716) recipe.  So, this is probably a good coffee base to work from if you want to bring in darker, sweeter fruits.\n\n**Notes:** S&V concentration testing, this is a bit weaker than you'd expect from Inawera. At .25% and .5% I get mostly a faint hint of chocolate. 1% is actually pretty good, as that coffee is still in the background, but you get more chocolate up front. Actually tastes a lot like hot chocolate here. 1.5% is bringing more of that coffee note and increasing flavor density quite a bit. 2% has a solid coffee note and some of that warming in creeping in. Kind of hits you in the chest like warm coffee will.  Chocolate is still present and pretty well balanced. By 3% I'm getting more coffee than chocolate, and the coffee note that is here is getting closer to that traditional esspresso kind of concentrate. That buttery roast / burnt note is still pretty subtle though. By 4% this is tasting too roasted for me and that's kind of detracting from the overall experience. I'd start with this at 1% for a more chocolately accent, 2% for a bakery or cream mix, and maybe 3% if you really want to push the coffee forward here in a recipe and you can deal with full chocolate flavor.\n\nAlso, FWIW, doesn't seem to be a super obvious coil-gunker, so that's a plus.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Notes from Botboy's Master testing list:](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/2ehekc/master_flavor_reviews_and_tasting_notes/)\n\n\"This is a nice light and creamy coffee/chocolate flavor. The chocolate/cocoa aspect doesn't taste fake or plastic-like, it's smooth and silky, and the coffee is perfectly blended in making this an extremely smooth vape. I'd recommend this to anyone that likes coffee vapes, while it may not stand alone as a coffee flavor for extreme coffee lovers, it would still be a great mixer to add into your existing coffee recipes, or create new chocolate/coffee type mixes starting with this as your base.\"\n\n[Couple of reccomendations from this thread on coffee vapes:](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/5fkhe2/getting_my_mother_into_vaping_to_quit_smoking/)\n\nbaphomet says: \"I've been enjoying, off and on, Mocca (INW) in the 2% range, with a touch (.25-.5%) of cream (Cap/TFA Bavarian Cream or HS Italian Cream; FA Vienna Cream would work well, I imagine, too)... Really balanced, mildly sweet chocolate cream with hints of coffee, nothing bitter or heavy like like what you've mentioned.\"\n\nburritoclock follows up: \"INW Mocca is the only thing I found to be close to ok.\"\n\n[Good talk on the FOTW Thread about this being chocolate heavy.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/5grkwh/chocolate_this_weeks_fotw_is_chocolate/dav2v8h/)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** INW Natural Mint @ .5%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 12 days\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Definitely a Mint. I get a bit of bright peppermint up front with a deeper spearmint towards the back as the concentrate sweetens up a bit. Mostly a mint extract kind of flavor, but just a hint of actual mint leaf and a mint gum type of body in there.  Moderate body, not quite as light as something like INW Mix Mint. Also seems to be less heavily mentholated than Mix Mint and nowhere near Eucalyptus & Mint.  Honestly, this kind of shifts around a bit for me, sometimes I get a pretty clear peppermint, but I'm kind of convinced I get a good amount of spearmint here as well. Maybe that's issue and I'm making myself taste spearmint here.  Whatever the actual variety of mint is, it's well done, and relatively subtle.\n\nInhale is mostly mentholated coolness with some building wrigley's spearmint kind of sweetness. Not dense, but heavier than a straight menthol. Exhale opens up with a burst of peppermint, and sort of builds to a sweeter, heavier spearmint.  That sweetness thins out a bit and then you get just a hint of leafier mint on the tail-end of the exhale.  Sweetness level is moderate, and pretty well balanced. The mentholation is a lot heavier on the inhale than the exhale. Clean finish overall. \n\n**Off-flavors:** Nothing weird.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Nah, pretty smooth. Even that mentholation is pretty well in control.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:** Personally, I like this mint for mixing with citrus or darker fruits. I think it makes a good pairing with berries especially, working well with deeper flavors like raspberry, blueberry, and black currant. I also really dig this with citrus, especially FW Blood Orange or FA Mandarin.  Also works well with lime flavors, my favorite being INW Lime.\n\nI also like this as a beverage mint, both because it skews at least a bit towards spearmint and that it has a hint of mint leaf here. In that vein, pairs fairly well with cucumber, black tea, and whiskey concentrates.\n\nIt's a better mint for trying to work into heavier flavors as it isn't super sharp and has just a bit of body on it's own. Not sure if a mint custard or bakery should be a thing, but there is where I'd start for that.\n\nI'd also start with this mint for tobacco mixes. Doesn't quite have the body you'd want for an herbal mint, but it seems to be the best option of the (admittedly) few I've tried.  Sort of in the same vein, it's a good mixer with darker chocolates, kind of giving you an Andes Mint type of vibe right out of the gate.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nTalking about concentration this is still fairly strong, but less overbearing than INW Mix Mint.  You're probably looking at .25% for a mint accent in a fruit mix.  I'd also start from there and work up for heavier applications.  S&V Concentration testing, this is pretty linear up to 1.5%. Menthol starts to get a bit overbearing for me at .75% but still pleasant.\n\nPersonal preference is obviously going to be the deciding factor here, but this is hands down my favorite mint. It's smooth, pretty easy to work with, and mixes fairly well while still having a punch and body to it.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Here's your ELR Page.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/30677)  Nothing all that useful, but some mention of this being straight peppermint.\n\n[And heres the BCF page.](http://www.bullcityflavors.com/natural-mint-wg-inw/) Again, some talk of this being straight peppermint.\n\n[Here's the same FOTW from the Mixed Mint review.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/3vt31w/flavor_of_the_week_mint/) No real discernible info on if this supposed to be a spearmint or peppermint, but some talk about INW Natural Mint's relatively subtlety.\n\n[/u/yoopergeek/ posted their take on natural mint in the previous mixed mint review: \"I recently picked up Inawera's Natural Mint and it seems to have a lighter coldness and more straight peppermint flavor.\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/5xcyqu/inw_mix_mint/)  I can't say I really disagree, as I do definitely get peppermint here. I may have just been using this as a stand-in for spearmint for too long and brainwashed myself.\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

    "markdown": "**Inawera Pair of Pears**\n\n\n**Setup:** eLeaf iStick Pico 75W, Kangertech Subtank Mini-C, 0,5 ohm SS organic cotton coil\n\n**Percentage used:**5% and 2,5%, 3 mg/ml nicotine base with 50/50 PG/VG ratio\n\n**Steeping:** seven days\n\n**Flavor:** It was a nice surprise for me to find out that I like pears, although I'm not a fan of texture, this weird semi-hard flakes that sometimes appear when eating them (don't know if it's the same with your American pears). Obviously it is not a problem when vaping pear flavored juice.\n\nThis is another fruit flavor that in my opinion does not need much steeping. On the first day it smelled just like it smells now, after seven days - little bit sour, fruity, with juice-like sweetness. It reminds me of pear juice, really. No signs of anything artifiicial, no creamy undertones. Just pear.\n\nI started off with 250 Celsius, then went up to 260.\nAt the inhale at 250 Celsius, there's just mild sweetness, and basically no throat hit either with 5 or 2,5% concentration. At 260 I started to pick up a fruity, sour taste, but still no throat hit.\nExhale is pleasant. There's this lightly sweet pear flavour filling my mouth, transforming into sour taste. Throat hit is there, but it's much lighter comparing to Melon.\n\n I don't feel that smoothness that I felt with their Melon aroma, but it does not surprise me as pears are not like that.\n\nI would not compare it to eating a pear, more like drinking pear juice, really. It's good, and I'm using it currently as my daily vape. \n\n\n\n**Uses and pairings:** Personally I think it would go great in fruity mixes as much as it tastes great single. I would pair it (hehe, pair a pair of pears, badum tss) with a sweet apple aroma as this one has a visibly sour thing to it and it's sweetness is not overwhelming. I vaped it with Juicy Lemon flavor and it was a good combination, too. It mixes well in my opinion.\n\n**Personal testing notes:** There's nothing wrong with using 5%, but I think it's a waste of aroma because there really is no much difference between 5 and 2,5% besides intensity of the flavor. I wouldn't go higher than 5% as I think acidity would be too much, and I have to try it more at 5% because most of the time I used 2,5% and want to be sure about best percentage. For now, 2,5% is good for me.\n\n**Second opinions:** None so far, but there will be soon.\n\n**Summary**: Really good and well balanced pear flavor, reminding me of pear juice more than a fruit. Probably mixes well with a lot of fruit flavors and does not need 5% concentration to catch all of it's taste.\nIf it gets released on the market I surely could recommend it to y'all.\n\nquestions/co-op: mrgvape@gmail.com\n\nZniżki na idym.eu/idym.eu discounts: enter YWJJ7KN5 code during checkout",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** INW Peach @ %2, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 16 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** A pretty solid darker peach nectar flavor.  Not super bright or realistic, but full and with just a bit of sweetness.  Tastes a bit cooked but not like canned peaches cooked. Doesn't get too candied or floral until you start pushing the percentages relatively high. A little bit of an earthiness on the back end, but no real green peel notes.\n\nInhale is fairly light, with a soft, fairly natural tasting peach juice sweetness. Exhale has a nice round peach nectar flavor. Errs more toward a softer flavor, rather than crazy bright and candy-like. Some pretty mellow peachier top notes, but those are pretty far down in the mix at 2% and under.  Just a little less dense than I want with something this juicy, but the exhale isn't noticeably astringent or anything.  Exhale dries out a bit on the back-end, with some earthy spiciness.  Clean finish, but that slightly dry earthy note lingers for a while.\n\n**Off-flavors:** I get some muddiness on the back end of this. It doesn't really taste like a greener peel kind of flavor. It's more sort of an earthy spiciness, kind of similar to INW Cherries. It's not a huge deal, especially when the rest of this is really solid, but I tend to notice it solo and it does some subtle, but weird things to creamier flavors when paired.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Light. It's there, but it's really mellow for this type of flavor.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This is a great peach to pair with some of the other, more floral peaches, to get a fuller peach flavor. This stuff can provide you with a lot of low-end that FLV Peach or FA White Peach seem to be missing without destroying your throat like TFA Juicy Peach.\n\nGood peach for fruit mixes. This will get some juicyness and a solid peach flavor without introducing too much throat hit or sharpness.  Peach flavors work pretty well with just about any kind of fruit, and the lack of harshness here is going to make it easy to stick it with just about anything.  If you are going to mix peaches and citruses, I'd definitely recommend INW Peach, just because you'll need all the help you can get on limiting throat hit.\n\nI think it's a good mixer with creams, but with the caveat that your cream is going to take on some of the fruit juicyness, as opposed to being just a peach-flavored cream.  I think it'll do a better job in a situation where you'd want some of that fruit body like a yogurt, as opposed a custard where the richer, creamier texture is more important.\n\nBakery-wise, I think you'd be better off sticking with something that needs a juicy peach filling. The juicy part of this concentrate is going to make it fairly difficult to get a really crispy, dry crust.  In those kind of drier mouthfeel situations, FLV Peach is probably your best bet.\n\nI personally think this is too moist for drier nut and tobacco mixes.\n\n**Notes:**  S&V concentration testing, this seems to hit it's stride around 1%.  At .25% and .5% it seems fairly weak with some juiciness but not a whole lot of flavor. 1% has a good hit of juiciness, and some of that sweeter peach flavor. 1.5% is starting to push more into a clear peach nectar. 2% is getting a bit thicker and sweeter, but I'm picking up some of that kind of murky back end. 3% has that peach flavor up front, but it's starting to get a little sharp and candy-ish. By 4% theres a pretty noticeable floral edge here.  I'd start at 1% and work up if you're after a natural kind of peach flavor. If you want a peach for pairing with heavier bases, maybe start at 2% and go from there.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[FOTW peach post with some love for INW Peach.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/3wtbgz/flavor_of_the_week_peach/)  Manson: \"After trying a few different peaches, INW has been the only one that didn't taste off to me. It's a darker Peach flavor, unlike FA White Peach. It tastes almost like the syrup in a can of peaches, but not as sickeningly sweet. Pairs perfectly with creams, as well as counterbalancing bright fruit mixes.\"\n\nSkiddlz follows with \"Fuckin INW peach. Peach rings @3%. Peach juice @1.5%. Fuckin delicious at any %.\"\n\n[Here's the ELR Page.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/2307) Lots of quick takes. Generally positive, most mention a higher concentration.\n\n[So in a review for CAP Juicy Peach /u/psyki/ gave a quick rundown of a couple of peaches.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/5cxmeu/cap_juicy_peach/) Their take on it's a little dour, \"experts only, even at low percentages can taste very \"earthy\". Tastes like a legit peach when used correctly though.\" I wanted to include it for some balance here because I totally pick up some of that odd sort of muddy backend on this stuff.\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

I don't really detect any Acetyl Pyrazine. It's calmed down quite a bit since I first mixed it. The raw peanut taste, while still there, has let a subtle sweetness come through a bit more. To be honest, I preferred it more around 2 weeks old. I have used, and will probably continue to only use this as an accent. It finds its way to the front of a mix pretty easily, so I suggest starting low. I had to back off from 1% down to .5% in one mix because it was all I could taste. So maybe start at .5% and go up from there. \n\n\n**Recommended Pairings**\n\nTobaccos. I've got this in a Burley NET and it's probably my favorite juice right now. Artificial Burley, I'm not too sure about. Maybe FLV Red Burley, but I haven't tried that yet. Should work well with any earthy tobacco though. Probably work in a 555 or RY4 type of mix as well, but it's not going to be your typical sweet dessert type. \n\nOther nuts\n\nAnywhere a peanut would fit. Maybe a sundae recipe? I tried it, but I can't really stand vanilla anymore, so I didn't like it. \n\nWood/earthy flavors. I use it with FA Oakwood in that Burley NET. Nice combo. \n\n**Off Notes**\n\nI'd say that the sweetness I'm starting to get from it this far in to the steep is an off note, but it's not really bad. I just really liked it when it didn't have any sweetness. \n\n**Notes**\n\nIt's called Peanut Tobacco, but I don't really get the Tobacco part. I think it's a good friend to tobaccos, but you'll need to add a Tobacco to the mix. Although maybe that creeping sweetness could possibly taste like a sweet Virginia or Flue Cured, I still wouldn't rely on it to carry the tobacco note. It's more peanut than anything. ",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** INW Peanuts @ 3%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 10 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Tastes like the peanuts in cracker jacks, or more accurately like the top notes of peanuts in cracker jacks. Fairly rich top-end with almost honey-roasted peanuts.  Sweeter than straight peanuts.  This seems to be lacking a savory \"base\" though. None of the thicker, gritty lower flavors you'd want from a peanut butter, but not crisp or grainy enough to really read as straight peanuts.\n\nInhale is fairly neutral. Maybe a little tart with a deep nuttiness, but it's hard to pick out. Some base sweetness with a moderate density.  Exhale has sweet peanuts right up front. Pretty mellow kind of peanut, almost tastes a bit baked or cooked. Tastes like it has a really light kind of brittle topping, like cracker-jacks or even a sweeter honey roast.  Sweetness level is on the high side. Not cloying but definitely a commerical kind of sweetness.  Flavor is extremely top heavy, with a metallic kind of emptyness on the bottom end where I want the deeper, thicker notes of a peanut butter or the drier, grainier base of an actual peanut.\n \n**Off-flavors:**  The tail end of this tastes metallic for me. I picked up that same kind of metallic hit on FA Hazelnut as well, and was about to chalk it up to some fairly well-used coils. These coils have been in for like 2 days, and I'm still getting that solid metallic aftertaste. Maybe it's just me, but I guess nut flavors have a metallic aftertaste? Or it's a reaction with the nifethal... but it seems similar in a stainless or kanthal build.  Maybe it's trying for a salty note or something? It just tastes like a handful of pennies to me.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Not really at 1.5-2%.  It can get a bit sharp up higher, but used fairly low there isn't much throat hit.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This desperately needs some Acetyl Pyrazine.  .25% AP improves the texture on this dramatically, getting you closer to a discrete peanut taste.\n\nAs it stands, this is a pretty good tool for getting a sweeter, candy kind of peanut flavor into something without messing with the texture that much. Should work well in bakeries for like peanut butter cookies.  If you can keep that metallic note in check (or you don't get it at all) seems like a good fit for creams or custards. The lack of body here isn't going to mess with your underlying textures.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, this isn't nearly as strong as I'd expect a nut from Inawera to be. This is my third run-up to testing this.  I started at .5%, and it was just too weak. I got mostly VG out of it. Next step was 1.5%, and that honey-roasted peanut kind of taste was there, but really top heavy. At 3% this is still nowhere close to overwhelming.  The top notes are getting a little sharp and the metallic taste in the backend has really picked up from 1.5%. I'm thinking there just isn't a real base to this flavor.  I'd recommend starting with this at 2% as an accent flavor or additive to another nut.  I don't think you're going to get the body out of this to work as a real primary note.\n\nSo I bought this from Gremlin as \"Peanut\", but I'm fairly sure it's INW Peanuts. It looks like INW just has \"Peanuts\" and a Peanut Tobacco flavor.  If I'm wrong, please correct me... but I can't find a reference to two seperate non-tobacco peanut flavors.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[So, hesitant to mention this because I don't want any part of the blackhole that is /r/goobergrapevape/ and I've never understood the appeal of vaping a PB&J sandwich... but /u/botboy141 recommended this as an ingredient in a peanut butter mix:](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/2xdfhd/lets_talk_peanut_butter/)\n\n\"A combination of TFA Peanut Butter + INW Peanuts does it for me. Little dry though so it helps to add some TFA Marshmallow or FA Vienna Cream to make it a little wetter/fuller.\"\n\n...but they probably knew that already.\n\n[So here's a post on ECF.](https://www.e-cigarette-forum.com/forum/threads/inw-peanuts.669203/)  User \"Jimi D.\" provides a quick take:\n\n\"It's very good. Tastes like salty peanuts. Don't mix too high though. It gets very dry, and the salt note becomes acidic feeling. I enjoy it at 1%.\"\n\nI don't get salt out of the weird metallic note, but I at least sort of get where he is coming from with it.\n\n[Not much on ELR.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/18102)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** INW Pear @ %1, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 17 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  So it's worth checking the second opinions right off the bat here, because my take seems to differ a bit from consensus.\n\nI get a realistic crisp asian pear flavor. A little bit of juicy body, a pretty prominent floral peel or skin note, and as close to a snap as I've got from a vape.  I get a fairly harsh vape from this, and I have a bit of trouble finding a percentage that has a strong enough flavor to read as a pear while keeping some of the earthiness and floral edge in check.  Overall, for me at least, it tastes more like a pear essence flavor you'd get in a vitamin water kind of beverage than an actual fruit, almost like a pear perfume.\n\nInhale is pretty airy, with some light pear sweetness. Exhale has a crispy, slightly gritty asian pear right up front which seems to fade out pretty quick. Some earthier peel top notes and a kind of hollow tasting back end. Not a lot of sweetness here, tasting undersweetened for something like a bartlett or anjou pear, but close to a underripe asian pear.  It's also a fairly light exhale for me, without much body past that initial burst of flavor.\n \n**Off-flavors:**  At lower percentages, I get some of the same muddy earthiness toward the back end of the vape that I get from INW Peach. If I start to push anywhere near 2% I also start getting a pretty pronounced floral edge.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Moderate. While the pear flavor in the concentrate has a bit of juice to it, I also get an odd, dry, throat hit. Increasing the percentage to try to find more juiciness here also increases that throat hit.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Personally, I'm sort of limited to using this at a lower percentage for more realistic top notes on a flatter, juicier flavor like FA Fuji or FA Pear.\n\nBased on the [publicly available ATF recipes,](https://alltheflavors.com/flavors/inawera-pear?original=true&owner=all&sort_order=new&suggestions=0)  this looks like it's being used either in conjunction with other pear flavors or in fairly busy recipes to push a bit of pear up to the front of a mix.\n\n**Notes:**  S&V Concentration testing, this is a bit weird. At .25% I get just a hint of that pear perfume kind of note without much body. At .5%, it's largely similar, but a rounder and less floral. At 1% I get a really good asian pear top notes, with a light sweet body. At 1.5% I get a solid hit of earthiness of the peel notes here. At 2% that earthiness is getting kind of floral and sharp. At 3%, this is reading way too floral for me.\n\nPersonally, I'm a bit bummed by this flavor. I think it has a good bit of utility in mixing, but it's going to need help as a full pear flavor.  Again, probably worth checking out the more positive takes here.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[The lastest FOTW Pear post, wherein /u/HocusKrokus drops science like Galileo dropped the orange:](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/5lrs24/life_without_it_is_almost_unpearable_this_weeks/)\n\n\"The king pear rears it’s fierce head. This pear is juicier than FA, and sweeter than both combined. It’s profile finds itself somewhere between a bright fresh pear and the syrup from a chilled can of pears. A very faint bit of the earthy backnotes I’ve found in TFA Pear, but much smoother. Mild throat hit if not mixed with another “juicy” flavor or cream. I find it a bit more potent than FA Pear, so I start at .25% as a supporting note, up to 2% in a mix, or 3% standalone. \"\n\n/u/Philosaphucker shares further in the comments:\n\n\"For a fleshed-out, saliva-inducing, juicy pear, I prefer to combine INW Pear with FA Pear in ratios that vary depending on the mix and my intentions (7:8, 1:1, 1:2, ect).\n\nIf I do not want pear to be at the forefront of my recipe, then I do NOT open INW Pear because it does not serve as a background flavor at all. One could even say that its floral nature can make it difficult to work with, but I have been pretty successful in pairing it with other heavy-hitting flavors (see Cactus @2%).\"\n\n[From the older FOTW:](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/3s4rad/flavor_of_the_week_pear/)\n\n/u/skiddlzninja/: \"I emplore everyone to try INW pear. It has the aroma and flavor of a fresh yellow pear, the truest pear flavor I've tried.\"\n\nA couple more measured takes, deleted user: \"holy fuck its wicked strong anywhere over 2%. So crisp it makes my teeth squeaky. I use it at .5% and its fresh and delicious but can't seem to get rid of that little bite/harshness that it has\" and /u/redhotmonkeyluv: \"Freshly mixed @ 3%, this is a slightly sweet pear with skin. It's lacking any base note. The heart note is light but pleasant and the top note is very nice - reminiscent of FA's Fuji. I can see this being easily overpowered in a mix. It works nicely with TFA's Pear at a 1:2 ratio with TFA filling out the bottom end that INW is lacking.\"\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** INW Pineapple Raw, 1 and 2.5%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 5 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Raw pineapple and black licorice.  [Inawera describes the flavor as: \"Fresh pineapple taste. Juicy, tempting and complex, with subtle hints of mint, anis and white almonds in the background.\"](http://www.inawerawinkel.com/Concentre-RAW-PINEAPPLE/1699/?i=en)  Maybe the \"subtle\" part of that is lost in translation, because the mint, anise, and almond part of this just tastes like black licorice to me. The actual pineapple here is a really nice take on fresh pineapple. Bright, sweet, and without any kind of canned taste.  It also seems noticeably stronger than pineapple in straight INW Pineapple. It's heartbreaking really, because they go and add a ton of licorice and cooling on here.  Overall effect is like eating raw pineapple and [black jujyfruits](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BscyoO_IIAAPMx_.jpg) together. Doesn't seem to be an overflavoring thing, licorice is relatively more pronounced at 1% than 2.5%. Pretty strong cooling here as well.  While it's not a poorly done flavor, I kind of struggle on what to actually do with it.  I'm pretty sure that licorice is going to be fairly difficult to work around if you want just the raw pineapple part of this.  Pineapple and Anise are actually a pretty decent flavor combination in deserts, but then you run straight into the cooling part of this.  It's a pretty decent solo flavor around 3%.\n\nInhale has sharp fresh pineapple up top.  Fresh cut, tart, really promising. The licorice starts to come in underneath that and builds quite a bit. Lighter mouthfeel, but a lot of that is from the cooling or mentholation. Exhale again has some pretty substantial cooling. Starts out as a fresh pineapple and mint, but the anise top notes and the cooling end up going black licorice pretty quickly. Sweetness level is pretty accurate to a mostly ripe pineapple, and the cooling takes the edge off any harshness here. I pink up some actual mint as opposed to just cooling on the tail end, and that licorice and mint linger.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  The licorice is a bummer. It's in the description, so maybe it's not an off-flavor, but it's nothing that feels like it belongs in a raw pineapple flavor.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light.  More just aggressive than harsh and the cooling helps substantially.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This is already pretty busy, and while nothing in here really clashes with anything else, I'm not sure what else is going to really fit in without getting weird.\n\nAnise and Pineapple are actually solid together in bakeries and deserts, but the cooling here is going to throw off the warmer, roasted flavors that are going to work better in those kind of applications.  This also comes across a lot more like black licorice than a straight anise.\n\nI don't think you'll be able to entirely get rid of the licorice vibe here, but I could see this being used an accent flavor in a tropical fruit mix to add a bit of contrast and interest.  I could also see adding some lime or grapefruit in here and just running with the weirdness.\n\nAlso, it's really not bad as a solo flavor, but only if you dig the idea of black licorice and pineapple together.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, at .25 and .5% I mostly get a light black licorice accent flavor. At 1% there is some bright pineapple here but it still feels a bit weak and the anise/licorice thing is pretty dominant. At 1.5 and 2% the pineapple is getting a bit brighter and tarter, but yeah, still black licorice. At 2.5% The pineapple is actually tasting legitimately like raw pineapple, with that intense tartness, but the licorice thing is still hitting pretty hard and the cooling is getting more pronounced. 3% is fairly similar to 2.5%. 4% is tasting like sour, fruity black licorice.  I'd probably use this around 3% as a solo flavor, or 1.5% as an accent.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  Nah, not really. \n\n[There is a forum page of taste tests for this, but most of these inawera sanctioned tasting notes are usually pretty vague.  \"Caffe23\" writes: \"Colourless mix, on a nice, pineapple smell. Very good in taste, mentholic pineapple. I can also notice some white candies (almonds).\"  \"madeyeck\" writes: \"I liked it very much, mint a bit too strong, but it’ll stick by me.\"](http://www.forum.inawera.com/viewtopic.php?f=160&t=4110)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Apple note seems like a warmer fuji type apple (or hey, why not just call it a pink lady) but I think there's some caramel in there as well.  It definitely doesn't taste raw or crispy, but it's something short of a broken-down really cooked apple. There's something like a softer caramel to it as well with some buttery notes that might be a light pastry kind of flavor. The apple and caramel thing actually reminds me a lot of [FA Cocoon](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/6s4433/fa_cocoon/) but with a sweeter, non-green apple, softer caramel, and lighter pastry-ish note.  The clove sounds scary, but it's really subtle and very well blended with the apple.  I pick it up mostly on the tail of the inhale and exhale, and it does a really good job of adding some subtle spice notes to clean up the stickier part of the apple here.  It's a pretty busy concentrate already, and most of the subtlety doesn't translate well at accent level percentages. I'd use this a primary note at around 3%.\n\nInhale has sweet, softer fuji-esque apple flavor up front. Warmer, but doesn't taste quite taste cooked like an apple filling. More just warmed. Building soft caramel sweetness with a twinge of clove in the top notes. Clove is nice and clean, not too savory and very well balanced as an accent flavor. Moderately dense mouthfeel, and the sweetness level fits with that caramel-ish note. Exhale has a more cohesive caramel apple flavor. Apple flavor is a bit stronger and more defined, taking on a sweeter red apple kind of character. Caramel note is still really soft, without any harder or grainier burnt sugar edges. More of a soft, slightly chewy mouthfeel. Light clove accent in the top notes, but not overwhelming. Cleaner apple flavor in the back half of the exhale and the clove picks up a bit toward the end. Lingering sweetness and light clove.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Nothing like the cloves with apple thing that Inawera is describing, but nothing that feels out of place or weird.  I think that softer, caramel-ish note can get maybe just a bit cardboard-y, but I get that with most softer caramels.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Very light, little bit of bite on that apple but nothing too bad.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:** There's a lot going on in here and I'm not quite sure what to add to it.  I think it's probably not \"baked\" tasting enough to pull off something like a pie filling but either some Liquid Amber or even another filling flavor like FLV Apple Filling might help that out if you wanted to take this in a pie filling kind of direction.\n\nMight make a decent caramel apple flavor for a caramel apple type of milkshake or ice cream flavor. The grassier notes in green apple tend to get weird with creams, and that shouldn't happen here.\n\nFor a caramel apple with a light spice note, this could probably use a small bit of a dryer caramel like FA or FLV to help sell the caramel here a bit better.\n\nWhen all else fails, mix it with a tobacco?\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, this feels soft and indistinct at 1% and under. Apple is coming through pretty clearly, but it's a softer double apple kind of red apple flavor and the clove isn't really isn't coming through. No real distinct caramel, just adding some warm sweetness to the apple. At 2% the apple has a bit more definition and the caramel is separating a little bit. Picking up some of that caramel mouthfeel as well. Clove is still an accent but the clove has a heavier spice note to it. At 3% this is feeling pretty full. Soft caramel mouthfeel, apple is fuller and has a kind of warm juiciness to it. Clove still isn't overpowering. At 4% the caramel is feeling a bit cardboardy and too soft. Still not a darker caramel flavor, and it's missing some of the flavor to pull off that softer, chewy texture. Apple note kind of tastes like hot apple juice.  I'd use this around 3% as a primary note.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  Either my googling is terrible, or I can't find anything out there about this flavor.\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

It's an awesome fit for CAP Jelly Candy, and I think this concentrate would be too. The overall flavor profile of the concentrate is close to the mix of FA Raspberry, TFA Dragonfruit, INW Shisha Strawberry, and INW Rhubarb used.  Maybe a bit sweeter, less developed, and less juicy for sure, but a similar profile.\n\nI'm an absolute sucker for rhubarb and red berries together (especially FA Raspberry and INW Rhubarb), so I liked this quite a bit.  With that said, I find this lacking when compared to a multi-flavor fruit mix. Having more control over the individual components would be better for a juicier fruit mix and the sharper green note of the single INW Rhubarb isn't really duplicated here.\n\nThis may be a better option for berry-rhubarb custards and bakeries. The overall sweetness and less sharp nature of the rhubarb already makes this seem a bit cooked and it will work better than the fresher taste of straight INW Rhubarb with those heavier flavors.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nThis is strong.

    "markdown": "**Setup:** Recoil w/ flavor barrel, Dual 15 wrap 26g 3mm Nifethal 70 coils @.17 ohms.  60w power, 450F temp limit. Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** INW Purple Rain @ 1%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 21 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Inawera bills this as violet and vanilla. It's definitely in the neighborhood. Tastes a whole like violet top notes on top of a vanilla base instead of one cohesive flavor. The violet flavor is actually pretty nice, less aggressively floral than FA Violet. Vanilla is a warm middle-of-the road vanilla without anything too sharp or distinct. Overall effect pushes towards an elderflower cream.  Really interesting.\n\nInhale is floral, some perfumey bitterness with a light green note. The violet is right in front of the exhale. Starts off a little green and then has a high perfumey violet almost elderflower top note. Vanilla comes in underneath that a bit later in the exhale and warms up the concentrate substantially. Really neutral vanilla, more in line with a whipped cream instead of a straight extract or candy vanilla. Lingering perfume on the exhale but fairly restrained for a floral. Really light pleasant sweetness throughout the entire exhale with some moderate density coming through with the vanilla.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Nah. Violet and vanilla, just like Inawera says.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Light. Mostly with the floral notes. Nothing major.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**\n\nSo this was probably intended as a one-shot, and that is probably the best use I can think of. The warm vanilla tames the floral violet quite a bit. The overall effect is pretty solid.\n\nThis would be a good sub for FA Violet at a slightly higher percentage. I can't think of a use for violet where the vanilla would be unpleasant or flagrantly out of place.\n\nThis should pair well with a sweeter citrus. It would add a really interesting dimension to something like a tangerine cream, with maybe a shortbread style of cookie.\n\nI can also see value in cocktail vapes, as it would be a good stand-in for a creme de violette and the florals would work well FA Gin. [There is a recipe for an aviation cocktail on ELR that looks super interesting.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/recipe/1016242/Aviator%20%28FM%20Gin%20series%29)\n\n**Notes:**\n\nLike most Inawera, this is pretty potent stuff. I feel like it's a bit indistinct under .5%, with a pretty full floral and vanilla coming through at .75%. Vanilla picks up quite a bit at 1% and over, but 1.5% is the limit for me before the violet gets too perfumey.  I'd mix at .75% and use 1.5% either as a solo flavor or a primary note.\n\nI like florals, but I'm assuming you do too if you're still reading. Overall, a really nice concentrate.   It's going to be a pain to mix with, but probably less so than most other florals. A really solid one-shot at 1.5%.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Some test reports on Inawera's forum.](http://www.forum.inawera.com/viewtopic.php?f=152&t=3938&p=23444&hilit=PURPLE+RAIN#p23444)  Posts have an english translation along with the polish.\n\n[One note on ELR, very floral but the mix of vanilla and violet is good.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/103856)\n\n[Super important research on the subject.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vJMTKtY4U8)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Not particularly an authentic & juicy raspberry, but an enjoyable raspberry flavor nonetheless.  Almost has a \"Gusher's\" juicy filling nuance to it, but with a darker more raspberry taste.  Definitely has some texture to it as a standalone. \n \n**Off-flavors:**  Sometimes it seems slightly chalky or powdery @ 2%, but not necessarily in a bad way.\n\n**Throat hit:** Very smooth on the throat. 2/10. \n\n**Uses:**  The ever popular [Rhodonite](http://diyordievaping.com/2015/08/17/rhodonite/) recipe by /u/enyawreklaw uses this at 0.5%.  Also great in other dessert, yogurt, or fruity recipes.  \n\n**Pairings:** Light or dark fruits, creams, custards, nuts.  I can also imagine it working well with a tobacco pairing.  A juicier raspberry or other juicy fruit flavor to round it out or make it \"pop\" could be used too if you prefer.\n\n**Notes:**   Greatly benefits from the addition of other fruits, but also holds it's own as a single fruit flavor in a mix due to it's high potency and unique texture.  I can definitely smell it when someone is vaping it.  This flavor seems like it would be pretty versatile in nearly any recipe.  If you're bored of what you've been vaping, sub a fruit or just add 0.5-1% of this and it will likely bring your recipe to a new level.\n\nEDIT: [Link to all of our flavor reviews in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)",

    "markdown": "##**INW Rhubarb**##\n\n*Summary*  \nTastes just like taking a bit out of fresh, crisp rhubarb. INW really nailed it on the head with this one. It's got a bit of a sharp tartness to it, with some sweetness that's reminiscent of an under-ripe strawberry, and a slight sort of fresh celeryesque taste to it. It is quite sharp/pungent at first, but mellows out in to something beautiful after a steep. This flavor makes a great star of the show as well as accent to other fruits or herbal profiles. This flavor is pretty forward, so it's definitely going to be playing towards the top of the profile. \n\n**On the Nose**  \nSomewhat sharp and tart. Smells like if you got some juice from rhubarb on your finger when slicing it up.\n\n**Recommended Usage**  \n*Stand alone*: 0.75-1%\n\n*In a mix*: 0.25-0.75%. \n\n**Throat**  \nMild to Moderate\n\n**Ideal Pairings**  \nBright fruits, Creams, Bakeries \n\n**Avoid**  \nDarker flavors; the brightness of the rhubarb & darkness of other flavors will clash.\n\n**Steep**  \n5-7 Days\n\n**Recipe Idea: [Rhubarb Custard Bar](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/9611)**  \n*Ratio: 15PG/85VG*  \n*Steep: 5+ days* \n\n**Ingredient**|**%**|\n:--|:--|\nFLV Vanilla Custard|1.5%|\nFLV Pound Cake|1.5%|\nINW Rhubarb|0.5%|\nLA Cream Cheese Icing|1%|\nFA Cookie|0.5%|\n\n\nHere you can really taste the Rhubarb without too much else getting in the way, since all the other flavors act more in the background. The Rhubarb brings a nice bright freshness to a somewhat dense and heavy mix, without clashing with those properties. There are a lot of spins you can put on this such as some INW Biscuit to accent the breadiness and make it a touch more buttery/flakey, as well as some Cheesecake or Meringue to accent the Cream Cheese Icing.

Both seems very realistic. No bakery or any similar smell present.\n\n**Testing:** More clove upfront than ginger. I can confirm that both spicies feel authentic, it gives you the right spicy note without scratching your throat out and I was surprised that it didn't feel dry at all. The big down side of this flavor is that there's no bakery notes at all, just pure ginger and clove. No off-notes present.\n\n**Pairings:** Floral profiles, tea's, bakery's and tobaccos.\n\n**Usage:** Overall I recommend this around at 0.25-0.5% since it's very concentrated. Tried at 0.75% but it started to get very dry and the clove even more upfront.\n\n**Conclusions:** There's no much to say unfortunely. It's ginger and clove. CAP Gingerbread is still my favorite and there's no comparison with this one.\n\n**More information:**http://www.inawerawinkel.com/CONCENTRATE-GINGERBREAD/1740/?i=en  \n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n**INW Miss Cream**  \nTested at: 0.5%, 1%, 2% / 2 weeks steep.\n\n**First Impressions:** One the nose I get fudge, a mild artificial vanilla mixture with heavy cream. The fudge is more prominent than the rest.\n\n**Testing:**That artificial vanilla note is messing the overall flavor. The cream is very dense to the point it makes your mouth with a 'heavy feeling', there's no dairy notes and it's way dry for my taste. Only thing I find positive is the fudge note which it's sticky and authentic. There's a dark caramel note somewhat similar to FA Caramel and a very mild dark chocolate note.\n\n**Pairings:** Custard's, bakery's and maybe tobaccos?\n\n**Usage:** Between 0.5%-1.5%. At low percentages, the vanilla is not so present which is good and allows the fudge to be more upfront. Upping the percentages, that dense cream starts to come out. I still tried to play with this with INW Custard and CAP VCv1 and the cream just messes with all.\n\n**Conclusions:** I really don't know what to do with this one. The vanilla note really messes me up.\n\n**More information:** http://www.inawerawinkel.com/CONCENTRATE-MISS-CREAM/1701/?i=en\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n**INW Rumble Crumble**  \nTested at: 2%, 3% / 2 weeks steep.\n\n**First Impressions:** On the nose, a mix of cranberry and blackcurrant, both authentic, cooked and warm. Not jammy. I get some kind of a baked cookie note too.\n\n**Testing:** Just like my first impressions, both the cranberry and the blackcurrant creates a beautiful bond. It doesn't give me a jammy or a syrup type flavour, just a slightly cooked and warm comfort fruit. The crust/cookie/crumble note is also noticeable but only in high wattages. FA Apple Pie helps a lot here to bring more that bakery note upfront. There's a light cinnamon note too but barely present.\n\n**Pairings:**Other fruits, bakery's, custards, tea's or other floral profiles.\n\n**Usage:** Between 2-3% seems the right spot. Didn't get any off notes and overall seems balanced. The downside of this flavour is if you want to make a crumble with other kind of fruits or only the crumble part, you'll get that cranberry and blackcurrant right on your face. So it's a very limited flavour.\n\n**More information:** http://www.inawerawinkel.com/CONCENTRATE-RUMBLE-CRUMBLE/1737/?i=en\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n**INW Yes We Cheesecake**  \nTested at: 2%, 3% / 2 weeks steep.\n\n**First Impressions:** On the nose, you really get what's supposed to be. This indeed represents an authentic European cheesecake. The cream cheese? Checked. The crunchy biscuit base? Checked too!\n\n**Testing:** Starting with the base. It's present and it's combined with the body of the flavour. It's cooked perfectly and it feels like it just came out of the oven. The cream cheese filling is on point! It tastes just like the Philadelphia (brand) cream cheese. You get the cheesiness of the cream cheese but it's not gross and it doesn't muddle the complexity of the flavour.\nThe cream component complements the rest.\n\n**Pairings:** Fruits and bakery's.\n\n**Usage:** Beetween 2-3.5% seems the right spot.\n\n**Conclusions:** If you enjoy cheesecake profiles, give this a try. This stands out compared to other cheesecakes like CAP NY, LA Cheesecake or TPA Cheesecake (Graham Crust), but this one I don't consider a cheesecake, more the base of one.\n\n**More information:** http://www.inawerawinkel.com/YES-WE-CHEESECAKE/1734/?i=en\n\n**Other topics in Reddit:**\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/6swmmj/inawera_yes_we_love_cheesecake_prepremiere_test/\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/86dxdx/inw_yes_we_cheesecake/\n\nPS: Sorry if I misplaced some words but English is not my primary language.",

There seems to be vanilla but it’s miniscule, chilling in the background behind everything else. I’m not very well versed in the realm of tobacco flavors but I think it could be burley in there. Exhale is burnt sugar/caramel which reminds me of INW Crême Bruleé but not in the same intensity. Thick dense mouthfeel, not as dry as I expected and overall mostly enjoyable flavor.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** INW Sesame Sweets, 1 and 2.5%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 6 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Warm, buttery caramel and roasted sesame seeds.  My experience with sesame candy is pretty limited to [these guys](https://www.amazon.com/SweetGourmet-Joyva-Sesame-Honey-Crunch/dp/B000HG8JNW) but it's pretty spot on. Sweet caramel note here, dark enough to read as caramel, but not all dry and grainy like FA Caramel.  Sort of like a an actual brittle taste, without any of the weird textural problems that would imply. Caramel note also has some buttery richness to it, which plays really well with the sweetness.  Seems to be something like a sweeter honey edge to it, which contrasts nicely with the roasted sesame seed flavor. Sesame has a spot on roasted flavor, nothing green or raw.  It's kind of nutty, but more like a honey roasted peanut butter kind of nutty.  Manages to avoid being too savoury or having any kind of weirder tahini or like sesame stick note. Fairly distinct flavor at low percentages, if not exactly overwhelming. Pretty clear down at .5% for an accent, but good up to about 3% as a primary flavor. Seems like a good base for any kind of nut brittle flavor, although I can also see using it in bakeries for some added warmth and roasted notes. I don't want to jump head-long into the peanut butter debate, but I dare say this could add some sweetness and roastiness to a drier peanut butter flavor for something closer to a commercial peanut butter flavor.  I'm sure there are more uses for this that escaping me right now, but yeah, it's solid.\n\nInhale has warm caramel up front. Manages to split the difference between softer, caramel and drier crispier caramel really well.  Some richer almost buttery notes in there without actually going full butterscotch.  Sesame nuttiness builds on the inhale. Moderately dense, full mouthfeel with a sweetness level that pretty dead on to the few sesame candies that I've had. Exhale is nuttier than the inhale. Roasted sesame up front.  Nice, warm, sweet roasted note. Something approaching a honey sweetness is coming out on top the more neutral caramel base. Those sesame notes stick around the whole exhale and linger for quite a while. No real harshness that I'm getting, and the mouthfeel is full without being muddy and thick.\n\nFWIW, I've heard reports that this tends to stick around in atomizers.  It'll definitely stay in your wicks if you try to drip over it but it seems to rinse out just fine.  I've never understood the aversion to cleaning and rewicking atomizers between changing flavors.  I will say that sesame flavor tends to stick on my hands for quite a while. It's not unpleasant, but you'll catch a whiff of sesame a couple hours later if you're sloppy with juicing up your atomizer.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Nah.  Everything that seems like it should be there, and nothing is wrong with what is there.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  I'm not really getting any throat hit.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Big dumb 'murican palate here, but I know that sesame is used in a lot of desert profiles around the Mediterranean, the Middle East, and into Asia.  This seems like a really good fit for anything that requires a distinct but well balanced sweet sesame note.  It has a warmth and toastiness that should work really well with bakery flavors in general, and as an accent at a low percentage it may actually punch up bready desert flavors without being instantly recognizable. Also seems like a good booster for something like a granola flavor.\n\nThis would also be a good base for a nut brittle flavor. The caramel note here seems dead on to tie together some more aggressive nut flavors and the sesame should blend in really well.\n\nI also think this would be an interesting accent for a tobacco as well.\n\nWith fruit pairings, I accidentally dripped this over some tangerine and it was pretty great. So maybe citrus?\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, this is a really distinct flavor. I wouldn't call it overpowering, but it's pretty easy to to pick out at a lower percentage, at least solo.  It does seem to be fairly linear though. At .25%, it's still definitely a sesame flavor but it's pretty mellow. Caramel hasn't really come together, more of just a honeyed sweetness.  .5% is a bit more aggressive. Sesame is a bit heavier, caramel is coming through a bit more. At 1% it's a bit stronger, but still linear. Sesame is a bit of a darker roasted flavor  Caramel is really filling in. At 2% I still wouldn't call this overwhelming, but it's getting pretty distinct. Strong roasted sesame flavor, caramel is a bit crisper and feeling pretty full. 3% is fairly intense, but the balance is still good. Heavy roasted sesame, darker sweet caramel. At 4% I'm starting to get some weirdness off the sesame, and the caramel is a bit dark. Tastes a little over-roasted.  I'd go low with this an accent with other stronger flavors, maybe .25-.5% but you may need to go even lower. As a primary flavor or solo, still works well up at 3% but may stomp over some more subtle flavors.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[ELR is a bit thin.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** INW Shisha Apple, 1 and 2.5%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 6 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Juicy red apple with some extra sour and tart in there. Doesn't cross over to a green apple or even double apple flavor, more like a tart and sour red apple.  CheebaSteeba in the second opinions notes that there might be some kind of malic acid in there, but FWIW the concentrate seems to be steeping fairly well without losing too much vividness, at least over 6 days.  I do get a decent amount of peel out of this but it seems to settle down considerably on a steep.\n\nI'd say it's one of the more realistic apple flavors I've tasted, at least if you can get past the sour and tart in a red apple.  That peel note is probably the most accurate part of this, and it seems fairly well in balance after 6 days.  The room note is basically fresh red apples, which is kind of a trip.  There's also some syrupy sweetness in here but feels pretty accurate to a ripe red apple.\n\nConcentrate has most of it's flavor up front and starts a bit dry, with a juicier, syrupy body on the back end.  The tartness carries through the entire vape but it doesn't seem to be messing with the mouthfeel much.\n\nThis is on the sweeter side, but the tartness here contrasts well and keeps the entire thing from getting too cloying.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  The sour red apple thing is a bit weird, but otherwise nothing odd at least up to 4%.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light to moderate, but this seems like another one that'll have some pretty sizeable variation for people.  I will say that tartness can be a bit harsh, especially at a higher percentage and solo.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  1% is too weak for this.  Mostly a light sourness and some red apple sweetness.  Doesn't quite feel juicy so much as watery on the back end.\n\n2.5% is quite a bit better.  I'm getting some decent red apple flavor. Tartness and sourness has ramped up a bit, but the flavor is fairly clear.  Moderate sweetness here, and I'm getting a bit of peel.\n\n4% is crazy for most Inawera, but I'm actually digging this higher.  That sweetness is going fully syrupy, and that tartness is making this really interesting.  Clear red apple flavor.\n\nJust based on these tests, this does seem like a weaker inawera concentrate.  I'd use for layering with other apples around 1.5-2% and a primary note from 3-4%, maybe even a tiny bit higher.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  So assuming this is a one-stop apple flavor for a shisha type tobacco, I can see this having some issues.  The apple flavor here should go well enough with non-nutty tobaccos, but I'd be a bit worried about the apple here moistening up the tobacco a bit too much.  That tartness is going to be interesting with a tobacco and should brighten everything up.\n\nI'd mostly focus on short steeping fruit mixes.  The tartness and sourness here should brighten up the other fruits it's mixed with. FWIW, this would be pretty great in a S&V Strap-On type recipe.\n\nThis also seems like it could be an interesting way to bring tartness into an apple mix without killing everything with grassy green apple notes.\n\nThis doesn't really seem like a good bakery apple, just because that tarter, sour juiciness would probably mess up the texture there.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  [Here's the ELR Page.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/20751)  A couple of notes in here. User \"MintyMods\" writes \"A decent apple flavour almost like apple hubba bubba... Its fresh tasting, no chemical after taste which seems to be the norm from a lot of apple flavours.\"  \"Ghettotrout\" writes \"Tastes exactly like those little green gummy frogs, the green ones with the white bottoms.\"\nI'd tend to agree more with user \"Citral\" who writes \"Nice, natural apple, great as a standalone or in a mix. Apple skin at first, mellows after steeping.\"\n\n[Noted did a show on the INW Shisha Flavors.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSITYZYzGa0) Cheeba covers it at about 31:15. Talks about relative weakness, sourness, possibly malic acid, and dryness down low. More of a green apple than red apple.  Not a lot of flavor 2% and under.  Smells great but better apples to work with.  Does have a syrupy sweetness.\n\n[Hey, you want to read a bunch of weird translations of polish testers saying this is a bit weak?

I don't necessarily get a really clear tart and bright bilberry/blueberry, more of a darker, sweet blackberry.  Clear berry floral top notes, and a deep base sweetness, but no real syrupy or jammy middle to it.  A bit on the floral side to recommend with anything but tobaccos, or heavy creams and custards. On the strong side, Recommended usage between .25-1%\n\nInhale is sweet and bit dry. Sharper, slightly bitter floral edge (like a really, really subdued FA Blackberry) and a dry dark berry sweetness.  Exhale has a bit of tartness in the top notes, but the florals kind of stampede right over it. Definitely in the raspberry/blackberry floral off-flavor kind of family. Deep blackberry sweetness, tastes quite a bit heavier and sweeter than I'd expect from blueberry flavor and not as tart and bright as FA Bilberry.  Moderately dense, but missing some body in the middle. Drier mouthfeel, but not harsh. Lingering bitter notes, most likely from the florals here.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  This is pretty floral overall. I don't think I've had a blueberry/bilberry flavor that was this floral. I've never actually had bilberries... so it could well be accurate but it definitely isn't pleasant. Overall, tastes more like a blackberry concentrate than what I guess a bilberry would taste like.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light, a bit dry but nothing too harsh.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  As an accent, this could bring in some more floral top notes and sweetness to a berry mix, either as straight fruit, or with a cream.\n\nAs a primary note, the lack of a middle of this concentrate would probably work with a tobacco.  The whole shisha thing I guess. Nothing jammy or wet to mess with texture.  I think the florals are going to be a bit weird with a non-aromatic tobacco, I think you'd want something with more of a leaf taste to hide those floral notes.\n\nThe floral edge makes this hard to recommend with bakeries or lighter creams. Adding this to a really heavy cream or custard should tone down those floral top notes though.\n  \n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, this is strong.  I get a clear flavor and sweetness at .25%.  Less floral down here, but tastes a bit flat and sweet. .5% is starting to get just a bit floral. Fairly realistic to a sweeter blackberry here.  .75% is getting to be a bit floral, with a heavy sweetness.  1% is getting a touch bitter from all of those florals. 1.5% is way too floral for me. This is going on a two week steep at this percentage, and it's still way too perfumey for me here. I'd keep this at 1% and lower, maybe even under .25% as an accent.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nSo I'm pretty sure this is the reformulated version,  I received this from BCF and I know they've only been carrying these for a couple months.\n\n[In an older FOTW, /u/terraborra/ says \"this flavour is a dark, dried blood red concentrate, that requires shaking before use as there can be sediment at the bottom.\" My version is a damn near clear, with maybe a slight yellow-ish tint.  So I'm pretty sure we aren't talking about the same concentrate here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/4hs3ub/flavor_of_the_week_blueberry/d2rxoc8/)\n\n[Inawera's website also cautions there may be sediment in the flavor, so I'm guessing it's a description of the old version.  This definitely has nothing that looks like sediment in it, and I trust that if there was supposed to be sediment in here, BCF would have included it.](http://www.inaweraflavours.com/en/inawera-shisha-flavours/706-shisha-bilberry-10-ml.html)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** INW Shisha Coconut, 1 and 2.5%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 6 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** A fairly well balanced, fluffy artificial coconut flavor.\n\nThe coconut seems a bit artificial in a good way.  This is a sweeter candy coconut, somewhere between TPA Coconut Candy and TPA Coconut Extra.  I don't get too much in the way of suntan lotion, but I do tend to like just a little bit of that to set off artificial coconut flavors so, as always, YMMV. This has less of an astringency than the the coconut candy, and isn't as sharp and overwhelming as the coconut extra.\nDefinitely in the same coconut universe as the filling from a mounds bar.\n\nTexture here is interesting.  It's a bit dry, and a bit fluffy. Kind of feels like a coconut flavored marshmallow.  The artificial coconut flavor is a bit stronger on the inhale, and the exhale has most of that fluffier, drier texture.  Sweetness here isn't cloying, but it's definitely on the candy side of things.\n\n[I have a recipe](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/46527#the_colada_affair_by_concreteriver) that uses TPA Coconut Candy, TPA Coconut Extra, FA Coconut, and FA Oba Oba.  I have a sneaking suspicion this flavor could mostly replace all of those in one bottle.  You've got candy sweet coconut, some intense artificial coconut notes, some flaked coconut dryness, and a marshmallow texture all from the same concentrate.  FLV Sweet Coconut is kind of my go to for a one concentrate realistic-ish coconut.  This may be a good single concentrate artificial coconut flavor.\n\n[Theres some really fun warnings about this flavor on one of Inawera's storefronts.](http://www.inawera.com/shisha-type-coconut-comestible-flavour-10-ml-p-1291.html)  \"ATTENTION! FLAVOUR CONTAINS NATURAL COMPONENTS. SEDIMENTS ARE POSSIBLE, PRECIPITATION OF COMPONENTS. SHAKE BOTTLE BEFORE USE OF THIS MIX PRODUCED OF THIS FLAVOUR\" and \"Contains dihydrocoumarin. May cause an allergic skin reaction Causes serious eye irritation. Keep out of reach of children. Wear protective gloves/protective clothing/eye protection/face protection. IF IN EYES: Rinse cautiously with water for several minutes. Remove contact lenses, if present and easy to do. Continue rinsing. If eye irritation persists: Get medical advice/attention.  If skin irritation or rash occurs: Get medical advice/attention.\"  So that's a thing. FWIW, I picked this up rebottled from Chef's and didn't notice any sediment and I'm not at all sure if I should be freaked out about dihydrocoumarin.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Right on the very beginning of the inhale I get just a tiny bit of a basil or anise note.  I don't feel like it's especially prominent, but it's nestled between some relatively aggressive artificial coconut on the inhale and a fluffier coconut marshmallow on the exhale.\n\nI've also got my temperature control fairly well dialed in by this point, and this seems to work a bit better with lower heat.  I'm getting some slightly astringent weirdness at 450F.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light to moderate, more from the dryness here than anything else.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 1%, I've got a pretty full flavor here. Strong artificial coconut, with that dry mouthfeel.  Sweetness level is good, if not full on coconut candy. Not too much really aggressive fake coconut.\n\nAt 2.5% this is feeling quite a bit dryer and fluffier.  Some of that suntan lotion taste coming in, and the candy coconut doesn't feel that much stronger.\n\nJust based on these tests, I'd probably start with this around .5% as an accent flavor, and go up to about 1-1.5% as a primary note.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I generally like to play big bright fruit flavors against artificial coconut.  In general, I'd pair with heavy, syrupy fruits like JF Strawberry Sweet, INW Shisha Strawberry, or INW Lime.  Goes well with tropical fruits in general, bright stuff like Strawberries and Kiwis, and melons.  I'd stay away from flavors that lean more artificial like bananas, unless that's the kind of thing you're going for.\n\nShould be a pretty solid bakery for coconut accents.  I could see this standing in as a more heavily flavored version of coconut flakes in a bakery, and would work well with cream or custard bases in a coconut cream pie type recipe.\n\nShould also pair well with tobaccos if you did want an artificial coconut.  The texture and mouthfeel here isn't going to ruin a drier tobacco, and the fake coconut is aggressive enough it should show up fairly easily.\n\n**Second Opinions:** I'm really not finding much substantive out there.  Couple of mentions that it's good or okay, that's about it.\n\n[Here's the ELR Page.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/14987)  User \"Kotsos\" has the only note on here: \"Less oily and sweeter than the regular INW Coconut, it mixes better in recipes as it doesn't get lost in the mix, but there are some sunscreen notes here and there.\"\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Tastes a lot like a non-alcoholic limoncello.  Some throat hit, but not too aggressive for a citrus.  Subtle zest note at 1% and above. Another option for lemon bakeries and sweeter beverages.  Recommend usage at .25%-.5% as an accent or 1%-1.5% as a primary lemon flavor.\n\nInhale has tarter lemon zest top notes, and a dense limoncello / syrupy lemon candy type of base.

Syrupy, but thick enough it comes across almost like a creamy lemon curd.  Lingering bitter zest notes and sticky sweetness.\n\n**Off-flavors:** I get some lime in here. Not a huge deal, but not as tart and bright as straight lemon.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light to moderate. First couple drags seem fairly harsh but it settles in pretty quickly.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  As a heavier, thicker lemon this is going to function a lot like a slightly more interesting version of FA Lemon Sicily.\n\nI think this is another Lemon that is destined for heavy use in bakeries.  Solo, tastes a good deal like Lemon Curd, so you're looking at the usual suspects like Lemon Meringue and Lemon fillings. Syrupy, but not really juicy, so you may be able to bring it into dryer bakeries to get lemon cakes and donuts.\n\nI've never really had a desire for lemon notes in tobacco, but it's probably a good place to start.\n\nGood for sweeter lemon beverages. Resembles lemonade concentrate or limoncello, so I'd mix accordingly.\n  \n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, this is potent and linear. .25% is fairly strong.  Kind of a flat lemon sweetness, without a lot of zest or tartness. .5% could pass a full lemon flavor, fairly similar to FA Lemon Sicily here, although maybe just a bit more tart. At 1%, I'm picking up a bit more tartness, and a bit lime on top of that sweet lemon. Still sweet overall, but pretty well balanced with just a hint of citrus zest bitterness.  1.5% has more zest, with a fairly pleasant bitterness setting off that syrupy sweet base.  2% is getting pledge-y and thick.  I'd recommend starting with this at .25% as a lemon sweetener, and 1% maybe up to 1.5% as a main lemon note.\n\nPutting this in context of some of the other Lemons I've tried... this is closer to JF Juicy Lemon, although denser and more syrupy compared to lighter and more effervescent JF Juicy Lemon.  A little tarter and more complex than FA Lemon Sicily, but seems to be about comparable in sweetness.  Not as bright or true to lemon as INW Lemon and not nearly as tart and sour as INW Lemon Mix.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nReaching for second opinions here a little bit...\n\n[Here's a post asking about Shisha Lemon vs. FA Lemon Sicily. Not much help in the comments, but OP says they \"damn near smell identical.\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/33a1b2/fa_lemon_sicily_vs_inw_shisha_lemon_fw_lemonade/)\n\n[Here's a recipe, from user \"Uncaged\" on ELR that uses Shisha Lemon with a quick note: \"Very tasty.

IMO this is better than FA Florida Key Lime, perhaps stronger flavor. Very round, full flavor from this. I really like it.

Dual kanthal clapton coils @ 0.397 ohms. 45 to 60w power, Cotton Bacon wicks. \n\n**Testing:** INW Shisha Orange @ 0.5%, 1%, and 2% 70/30 VG/PG, Steeped 6 to 7 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Orange Italian soda syrup. Shout-out /u/ExclusiveGirl for that one, I was struggling to describe it on my new flavor review podcast and coming up with \"some kind of imaginary orange pancake syrup\" until she chimed in on the live chat and asked if it tastes like orange Italian soda syrup. I've had, and yes, it does. Inhale gets you some of the bitterness of a natural orange oil taste but on the way out and to the finish, it's a sweet, syrupy-textured orange very much like that soda syrup, which tastes like it was made from actual oranges. Valencia oranges, if I had to be precise. But definitely not OJ. Not biting into an orange. Also not the same as the more fake-tasting orange flavor in something like Sunkist. Orange Italian soda syrup is the best I can do for this one. For a comparison that might be more relatable to more mixers, it somewhat reminds me of the orange note in TFA Orange Cream, minus the cream. \n\n**Off-flavors:** I don't think so. One thing most of these Shisha flavors seem to have in common is a syrupy character. It's orange, it's syrupy, it's what you should expect. For another comparison to a more common flavor, think INW Shisha Strawberry, but with orange.  \n\n**Throat Hit:** Nada. Pretty cool for a citrus, right?\n\n**Notes:** It's pretty weak at 0.5% but also *seems* a bit more bitter and orange-oily; what I think is happening is that that note is staying the same and carrying into the exhale a bit down low. At 2%, the sweet syrupy aspect becomes more pronounced and takes over the exhale and lingers in the aftertaste. 1% falls somewhere between. I would use this at 2% or maybe even higher. This is not a bit of orange zest to add as a flourish. You're gonna want to build your recipe knowing this is going in there. \n\n**Uses & Pairings:** Not sure how well this syrupy stuff would do with heavy creams, but it seems dying to be mixed with lighter vanilla creams. If vaping flat orange cream soda sounds as good to you as it does to me, go for it. Also, orange creamsicle and orange Creamsaver. Adding candy texturizers and sweetener could easy take this into an orange slice candy direction though I very much appreciate that as a standalone flavor, it doesn't taste like those things. I hate them. \n\nCocktails. DO NOT attempt to use this like OJ in a cocktail vape. It doesn't taste like OJ and you will ruin your cocktail recipe doing that. However, if you want to use it like Curaçao liqueur, I think it would absolutely work perfectly for that. \n\nSubstitute/improvement for TFA Orange Cream. I'm a fan of TFA Orange Cream, but it needs two weeks or more to reach its potential, and even then, there's something missing from it. Mix this with a lighter cream with a good mouthfeel, you can probably make a quicker-steeping orange cream flavor that tastes like orange syrup flavored with Valencia orange oil rather than generic artificial orange. \n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nELR notes suggest 2 to 2.5% preferred single flavor. Someone complains that \"it doesn't blend (with other flavors) in high VG juices and creates an 'oil-like' surface if too much is added to the recipe.\" Someone else really likes it, but finds it to be very strong: \"I used 0,5% in a tobacco recipe and it completely killed the tobaccos.\" \n\nELR user Kotsos writes, \"I find INW Orange and FW Blood Orange to be tiring after a few puffs and I don't think they play well with other flavours. This one is far better and stands strong in a mix at 1%. It starts off as sweet orange juice and after two weeks it becomes smooth orange cream :) Preferred single flavor mix: 1.5%\" \n\n*I did not get anything even hinting at cream, but I'll put my samples away and try them again in a week*\n\nThere are no reviews on Gremlin DIY, where I got mine, or at BCF, which also has it in stock. \n\nBe sure to check out all of the other great reviews at \n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**\n\nExcept the one about FA Cookie, that one's just stupid. \n\n**Video Review:** In [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSITYZYzGa0&feature=youtu.be), the first episode of NOTED, I try this flavor for the first time and talk about it and other Shisha flavors with my co-host /u/CheebaSteeba and temporary co-host /u/Skiddlzninja (/u/mlNikon will be taking Skiddlz's place when she gets back from vacation week after next).

    "markdown": "**Setup:** Recoil w/ flavor barrel, Dual 15 wrap 26g 3mm Nifethal 70 coils @.17 ohms.  60w power, 450F temp limit. Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** INW Shisha Punch @ 1%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 18 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** A warm mulled or cooked spice blend.  It's really hard to pull this flavor apart, but I get orange zest, cardamom, cinnamon, star anise, and clove. A really warm spice mix, without those sharp raw spice notes that you'd get from holiday spice.  Straight victorian silver bowl punch spices bordering on cocktail bitters.\n\nInhale is slightly sour with some sharp citrus and heavy non-bakery cinnamon. Exhale starts off with a brief flash of cardamom, moving into star anise and finishes on a lingering warm clove.  Citrus sourness throughout especially noticeable on the back end. Light baseline sweetness without tasting sweetened at all.  Very warm flavor, leaves your mouth a bit numb like heavy clove will. \n\n**Off-flavors:** Nope.  All sorts of spice flavors but nothing unexpected.\n\n**Throat Hit:** No, not really.  It's an aggressive flavor but it doesn't have any real throat hit.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**\n\nSo, my mind goes straight to punch.  And again, when I say punch I'm not talking about whatever jungle juice abomination they serve at high school parties.  The traditional rum punch recipe is 1 of sour, 2 of Sweet, 3 of Strong, and 4 of weak. So I'd build one of those, and use this for a spicy bitters note. Just spitballing, but I'd figure out a lime with some serious zest, use FA Hypnotic Mist and FLV Orange Citrus for a Curacao stand-in, FA Jamaican Rum and a bit of FA Liquid Amber for the strong, and take it from there, cutting it back with whatever juicy citrus or pineapple works.\n\nTaking advantage of the bitters vibe, you've got all sorts of cocktail options.\n\nThis would an interesting more realistic mulled wine or spiced apple cider flavor.\n\nI've also used this in a warm spice cake type of recipe, just taking advantage of the fact that this tastes cooked and a little more complex than normal holiday spice flavors.\n\nThis also seems like a fit for mixing with a dryer, straight forward tobacco both as a way to add some volume and light sweetness while giving you a warmer spice flavors that should work with the warmer character of tobaccos.  You'd have to watch the sourness, though.\n\n**Notes:**  So this is strong, like 1 drop per 10ml strong. It's assertive, but not super sharp so you have some leeway here.  Start off low and work up from there until you hit the right spice note. Fairly sharp as a S&V, so give it a steep before you judge how much spice you need. I couldn't imagine needing more than .5% in a mix.\n\nI picked this up after checking [this recipe out.](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/20241#winter_warmer_bourbon_old_fashioned_by_criticalvape) User criticalvape describes this flavor as \"A grossly under-appreciated flavoring that is pretty tasty on it's own around 0.5%. With notes of cinnamon, clove, cardamom, nutmeg, star-anise, and then some. Shisha Punch stands in for the quintessential aromatic bitters.\"  That's a really solid description and the more I vape this the more dead on it seems.  Thank you criticalvape, you have enriched my life substantially.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nNot too much here, besides that ATF use.\n\n[Couple good notes on ELR, talking about the spice mix and using this low.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/31269)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

    "markdown": "**Setup:** Recoil w/ flavor barrel, Dual 15 wrap 26g 3mm Nifethal 70 coils @.15 ohms.  60w power, 450F temp limit. Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** INW Shisha Raspberry @ .5% and 1.5%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 11 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Sweet, dry, and dense slightly candy raspberry, without too much in the way of tartness or juiciness.  Most useful when you want a good \"raspberry\" flavor without much realism or moisture to blend into drier tobaccos or layered bakeries. Pretty strong overall, but not quite as strong as INW Raspberry Concentrate. Use at .25-.5% as an accent, and 1.5-2% as a primary flavor.\n\nInhale is very sweet and fairly dense, with a thick candy raspberry taste. Like a fancier raspberry hard candy.  A bit syrupy, but not particularly moist. Exhale is more of the same. Dense, sweet raspberry. No floral edge here, but a pretty modest tart brightness in the top notes. Heavily sweet base, like a sweetened raspberry syrup.  Sweetness tastes sugary, as opposed to any kind of weird artificial sweetener. Moderately dry mouthfeel, with a lingering sticky sugar lips and just a bit of bitterness.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Nah, not really.  Sweeter, candy raspberries can get a little robutussin-y if overdone, but it doesn't really seem like an issue sub 2%.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light to moderate, nothing too crazy but a bit dry and harsh, especially over 1%.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I'm going to run with the Shisha thing, I think the preferred pairing here is with dryer, roastier flavors.\n\nI can see this working really well with tobacco flavors in general, especially nuttier non-aromatic tobaccos. I think the relative dryness and dense nature of the flavor is going to do a good job of sitting in one place in a mix and not causing the rest of the juice to get too juicy or wet.\n\nAlso seems like a good raspberry to use in bakeries.  It should stay put in the mix, and not moisten or mess any of your more textured bakeries. Adding some Liquid Amber will get a pretty realistic, gelatinous kind of filling.  Should have the same kind of affinity for chocolate.\n  \n**Notes:**\n\nConcentration testing, this is fairly linear, so this is going to be pretty boring. .25% is definitely present, but not overwhelming. Light sweetness, and a lighter candy raspberry flavor. .5% has a bit more body to it, definitely reads as candy down this low. I get most of the tartness out of this flavor by .5%. 1% has a heavier, solid body. Tartness complimented by that intense sweetness. 1.5% is pushing it a bit, getting a bit warm and syrupy, while still on the dry side. 2% is my usuable limit. Just toeing the line on robutussin, but a heavy, solid sweetness.  Those top notes are getting just a bit bitter and medicinal. 3% is pretty solidly medicinal. Too sweet, too thick, and a bit bitter.  I'd recommend mixing with this at .25-.5% as an accent flavor, and 1.5-2% as a primary note, especially if you're using this as a jammier filling with some added Liquid Amber or a candy texturizer.\n\nThe big question is how it compares to other available raspberries. From my semi-limited experience, this has the most in common with FA Raspberry. It definitely has the same kind of candy, syrupy vibe but it's missing some of the tarter, floral realism of FA Raspberry.  Sort of similar to TFA Raspberry Sweet, but quite a bit stronger and fuller without any of the weird ketchup-y notes you can get from that. Comparing it to the standard INW Raspberry, it's a bit dryer and sweeter. I'm usually a little iffy on INW Raspberry, it sort of tastes like a raspberry sucker that's been in someone else's mouth with that really juicy, wet and warm kind of texture (shoutout to my nephews for this awesome frame of reference.)  INW Shisha Raspberry is a little more solid and should do a better job of staying where you want it while still having a strong, clear flavor. Most of the other raspberries I've tried have some pretty glaring flaws, like CAP Raspberry or FW Razzleberry.  This is definitely less floral than CAP Raspberry and less candy forward then FW Razzleberry.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nI've found a lot of mentions of this flavor, but nothing really substantive, so this section is going to be pretty light.  Maybe my google-fu is just weak today.\n\n[ELR isn't super useful here, mostly relatively high recommended percentages. A couple of mentions of this working well in bakeries.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/21244)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

It's like a mix of an artificial sweet strawberry, a natural strawberry, and has a sort of creamy or smooth texture to it. I remember hearing before purchasing this flavoring that it was the best strawberry out there, and that it's the only one you need; I disagree that it's the only one you need. It is great by itself as a strawberry, but I feel it benefits a lot from a slight strawberry ripe accent (depending on the recipe of course).

    "markdown": "##**INW Shisha Vanilla**##\n\n*Summary*  \nOne of my favorite vanillas, simply because of how versatile it is, especially when used with creams. This is a very creamy, light vanilla with a nice sweetness about it. When I say light I don't mean light in flavor, but light in profile, as opposed to dark. You definitely get some nice vanilla, but it's not quite as dark of a vanilla as say FA Bourbon Vanilla or McCormick's Vanilla Extract (lul). This flavoring adds some decent creamy body, smoothness, and a touch of vanilla sweetness to a mix.

It also has a slight leathery back note, which is expected with some tobaccos.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Nothing really off here, it tastes a lot like vaping an average priced cigar.\n\n**Throat hit:** 7/10 decently rich @3%, likely a lot less if used as an accent.\n\n**Uses:** Standalone 3% it's legit, 4% I haven't tested, but with other INW tobaccos, I would imagine this getting numbingly richer.  This would also work at 0.5-1% to round out something weaker like FA Cuban Supreme or another mild tobacco flavor in your arsenal.\n\n**Pairings:**  Milder tobaccos, tobacco additives, vanilla, brown sugar, caramel, butterscotch, coffee, maybe some light cream if you want to tone it down.\n\n**Notes:** This leaves a filmy residue in my dropper bottle as well as my tank, still noticeable after the 4 week mark.  I question its health risks due to the residue, but it is tasty if you're a tobacco head.  It tastes slightly funky before a decently long steep, but the wait turns over a whole different realm of taste.  I would recommend a full 3 week steep minimum before you judge this flavor, maybe even 4+.\n\nFlavor available at BCF [here](http://www.bullcityflavors.com/tobacco-absolute-cuban-cigar-wg-inw/) \n\n[Link to e-liquid-recipes notes on this flavor](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/12406)\n\n[Link to all of our flavor reviews in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)\n\n\nedit word",

Tastes like the Rose doughnut filling. Dosage 8-10 drops in 10ml e-liquid\"\n \n**Conclusion:** Freshly mixed I just got a real strong rose note. After it steeped for 4 weeks the rose is still there but it has calmed down. It is more of sweet rose water note. Also getting some tangy like sourness at the end of exhale. I believe that is supposed to be the tobacco. A lot of the INW tobaccos i have tested I get a slight tanginess but there is also some grassiness that goes along with it which is not there with this flavor, but it can be easily added with some INW Virginia Absolute. This flavor is also on the dryer side like a lot of the INW tobaccos. I noticed after 3-4 hits my tongue would be really dry. I have never had a rose filled doughnut so I can not say if this taste similar to that.\n \n**Uses & Pairings:** Burley, Virginia, & Turkish tobaccos, Kiwi, & Honey. I found a few REAL tobaccos that used rose. Most of them used the same tobacco blends that i listed above. I found one hookah tobacco that used rose, virginia, kiwi, & honey.\n",

Almost creamy. Like a cream soda type of sweet creaminess. Tobacco leaves in the background. Maybe some woodsy and smoky notes hiding in there as well, but not very noticeable. Reminds me a bit of Indigo's The Stuff, if my memory of that flavor serves me correctly (been about a year.)\n\n**Off-flavors:** I wasn't really expecting to taste cream soda, but it's still a good flavor. \n\n**Throat hit:** Hardly any. Smooth. Kind of thick, but not harsh. \n\n**Uses:** If a cream soda-esque tobacco sounds appealing, single flavor this shit at 5%. If you're looking for something a little more robust and dark, but with a smoothness to it, throw this in with it at around 2% and adjust from there (FLV Red Burley and INW Dark for Pipe come to mind, but I haven't experimented with it... yet.) Add some caramel and vanilla and build your own RY4. It's not what I was expecting, but it's not useless!\n\n**Pairings:** Dark tobaccos, vanillas and creams, coffee, maybe some fruits.

It's kind of hard to taste much more than grape soda. Really strong in the beginning, but it's still quite up front at the month and a half point. \n\n- Smoke. After aging a while the smoke and grape soda kind of finds a balance. Hardly detectable at the beginning, it comes in eventually. It's not an FA Black Fire type of wood smoke. More like a heavily filtered flavored cigar. Think along the lines of Cheyenne cigars, if you were ever broke and desperate enough to buy those. \n\n- Cigarette shop. Not that it tastes like cigarettes, but every cigarette shop I've been in has this smell to it. Like they're all smoking in there, but they sell incense and you can kind of smell that mixed with the smoke in the air. That's the best I can describe it.  \n\n**Mouth Feel:**\n\n- medium density\n\n**Off Flavors:**\n\n- Considering Inawera describes this as a typical tobacco flavor like a cigarette, I guess grape soda is kind of out of place. \n\n**Position In A Recipe:**\n\n- I've got a feeling that this little guy is going to pop up as a top note no matter what. \n\n**Suggested Percentage:**\n\n- .5-2%\n\n**Pairings:**\n\n- tobaccos\n\n- If you're looking for a grape soda shake and vape, single flavor at 3% and get 'er gone before the smoke shows up\n\n- Anything that might taste good with grape soda?

A month and a half is as long as I'm willing to wait.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** INW Vanilla Bourbon @ 2%, 60% VG, 40% VG, Steeped 30 days\n\n**Flavor Description:** A relatively clean, commercial fluffy vanilla flavoring. A lot like a cream soda, or canned frosting type of vanilla. Strong resemblance to a marshmallow.  Very similar to INW Vanilla Shisha, although less creamy.  Dense and sweet, non-floral but a bit simple for a vanilla..\n\nInhale is all sweet fluffy vanilla. Nothing dark or complex here, but still really tasty. Exhale is more of the same, really. I'm going to say fluffy again, just because it's so pronounced. Natural tasting sweetness, almost a bit cloying. Vanilla note is clear and bright, but no richer dark flavors or floral top notes. A solid vanilla-heavy marshmallow, all the way.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Not bad, but pretty damn close to a marshmallow flavor.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Light to moderate throat hit. Sweetness here just hits my throat wrong.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This would work as a marshmallow... so the million and a half uses that people have found for that. Thickens creams, fluffs out pastries, adds sweetness and body to thinner mixes.  The sweetness is just a bit overbearing for me here, and so I'd watch that.\n\nToo fluffy for custards and rich buttery bakeries.  Vanilla note reads too candy for anything particulary complex.\n\nGood vanilla note for a thicker frosting. A bit cleaner and brighter than FLV Frosting, but less complex and rich. Honestly, INW Vanilla Shisha would work better just because of the added creaminess and richness, but this could be a good stand-in.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nVery light coloring, almost clear.\n\nS&V Concentration testing, this is a nice bright vanilla at 1%, anything lower and it feels like a bit of a waste as the sweetness and vibrancy just doesn't come through. 1.5% starts to get fluffy and by 2% that marshmallow really kicks in.  I'd mix at 1% as a bright vanilla, and 2% if you want to go full mallow.  Anything higher gets too sticky sweet for me, and the throat hit gets a bit rough and dry.\n\nSeriously though, just use INW Shisha Vanilla.\n\n[**TFA Vanilla Bourbon Flavor Review**](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/5lqdpb/tfa_vanilla_bourbon/)\n\n[**FA Vanilla Bourbon Flavor Review**](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/5lqejv/fa_vanilla_bourbon/)\n\nReally simple take on the available Vanilla Bourbon concentrates: INW reads marshmallow, TFA reads malty extract, and FA reads as a warm vanilla additive.  I'd use INW for strong, bright marshmallowy vanilla in a fruit mix or over the top rich mixes, TFA for heavy custards and bakeries without spice, and FA for lighter creams and bakeries with a bit of spice as well as nutty or tobacco mixes.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[ELR notes are really sparse.

Or actually any other watermelon-flavored candy? \nWell, it is not much different than that. First of all - the smell. This concentrate smells just like watermelon candy, with one difference - it's slightly more sour. I expected it to be reaaaly watermelon-ly, but well, if you expect something different than what I described above, you might try something else.\n\n**The inhale.**\n\nAt the inhale, 215 Celsius the throat hit is on the milder side I would say. I can't really taste watermelon there, more like honeydew melon for me, which is nice! Similar to INW Melon.\nSomewhat creamy and a lil bit tart melon-like taste.\n\n**The exhale.**\n\nThe exhale on the other hand hits me with a quite rich mix of honeydew melon and watermelon taste, the honeydew part is definetly more natural than the watermelon fraction of this composition. So in the end, what you get is a pleasant taste of candy watermelon, kind of balanced with honeydew. By balanced, I mean that the sourness of artificial watermelon is reduced by the other one. I like that. Throat hit is still mild, but stronger than when inhaling.\n\n**Uses and pairings:**Could go well with pineapple, I would suggest pairing it with something sweeter than watermelon.\n\n**Personal testing notes**: 5% is fine, no need to go higher.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** INW Grapefruit @ %1, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 19 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Tart white grapefruit. Heavy on bitter zest, light on actual fruit.  Fairly harsh, with a warm and waxy mouthfeel overall.  This makes me feel like I must be vaping the oil from a grapefruit peel. I know I'm not, but it really does hammer that point in.\n\nInhale is warm and moderately dense. No real sweetness or flavor in the base, but some neutral volume and a waxy mouthfeel. Harsh zest builds in your throat. Exhale has a bit of slightly sweet, very tart white grapefruit up front, with a strong zest top note. That zest takes over the vape, and it really feels like you're just vaping grapefruit zest. The back half of the exhale is spooky accurate to a spray of citrus oil you'd get from peeling a grapefruit. Lingering grapefruit zest flavor and a waxy mouthfeel\n \n**Off-flavors:**  Seems a bit warm and waxy for a citrus.  The zest note is crazy strong, but accurate.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Fairly harsh solo.  Used as an accent, at a low percentage it isn't a big deal, but it ramps up pretty quickly.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I like this a whole lot more as a component in a grapefruit rather than a full grapefruit. I can't get to a full juicy flavor without tripping over all that tart harshness.  I personally like this as a grapefruit zest additive at .25% to maybe .5% at the max.  This works well as adding an edge back to sweeter grapefruits like CAP grapefruit, INW Grapefruit, or even FLV Pink Guava.\n\nTends to stand out in fruit mixes, a whole lot like a zesting fresh grapefruit on top of other fruit. I like it to add a bit to contrast and pop to darker, juicier berries. I enjoy this with FLV Cranberry but I'm a big believer in bitter accents in sweet fruit mixes.\n\nMakes a good cocktail grapefruit with champagne or gin.  Doesn't quite mesh with darker, syrupy liquors like whiskey or rum.\n\nI personally wouldn't try mixing it as a primary note with creams or bakeries.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nConcentration testing, this is the first time I've ever brought this up over .5% and I'm not a fan. I think you get a great zest note as low .25% and you don't add much by upping the percentage. At 1% this is quite a bit warmer and waxier but I'm still not getting anything that tastes like a full grapefruit flavor.  2% is damn near unvapable for me. The sharpness of that zest note is absolutely overwhelming. I'd start with this at .25% and work up.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[/u/DrDoobie22 doesn't get the throat hit and gets a fuller grapefruit than just the zest.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/4ldt6l/inawera_white_grapefruit/)\n\n[User \"Aurora-Oblivion\" on ECF with the INW reviews, heres White Grapefruit:](https://www.e-cigarette-forum.com/forum/threads/inawera-flavor-review-45-flavors-from-inawerashop-add-yours-too.546838/)\n\n\"Very citric, bright and tart right after mixing, and has amazingly true to fruit flavor. After steeping the tartness does smooth over some, but nothing I'd consider a fade or loss, ect. The flavor is tart and slightly sour, with a little sweetness to it. The overall flavor is an exact flavor match to a regular white/yellow (not pink) grapefruit, tasting like you squeezed it directly out of the fruit and into your tank!\n\nThis would be a great mixer for any drink style mix you wanted to tart up, and would also work great to add some zing to any citrus type fruit mix.

The ice-creamy flavors rarely smell like actual ice cream, but on a side not - if you had ice cream in a container and didn't know what it was, you wouldn't know it's ice cream by the smell, right? :D\n\nIt smells like white grapes and wild strawberries with a citrus-like twist. But the grapes in this juice are more like a kinda sweeter grape juice, not actual fruit. The strawberry tones are more of a freshly cut strawberries. It's really pleasant!\n\nAs for the throat hit, with shake&vape it's actually pretty hard. After a few days it becomes lighter, but is still there and I can feel it. As I stated in my other reviews - I like the harshness. :)\n\nThe taste is, for me, great. It's weird, but it's hard to decide what I can feel the most. Grapes or strawberries? It feels like a mix of the two. It leaves a slightly sour taste on my tounge, and tastes more like sweet and sour strawberries than grapes. A question for you, guys - do you know these powder candies, or lollipops that you dip in a fruity powder and lick 'em? I used to eat them all the time as a kid. The taste reminds me of that powder also. I can taste a little bit of orange in there, also.\nThe juice is not too sweet, I actually don't taste anything \"chemical\" like i.e in some watermelon juice,  where you can tell just by smelling it that it's pure chemistry.\nAs for the \"ice cream part\", there's a slight, teeenie tiny bit of coolness in mouth after vaping, but barely noticeable.\n\n**Uses and pairings:**I would go solo with this. Maybe add a little bit of something like vanila to create actual ice cream flavor.\n\n**Personal testing notes**: 2% is alright, no need to go higher. Steep a little before vaping, it gets slightly better overtime.\n\n**Summary:** I don't know if it's in sales internationally yet, but when it will be, try it! It's a nice, light taste that will suit most of fruity juice lovers. Tastes not much different on generic kangertech coils and custom made alien coil in Kayfun v5, which is a flavor chasing tank.\n\n\n**Questions**: DM @unodosvape on instagram or mrgvape@gmail.com",

Both seems very realistic. No bakery or any similar smell present.\n\n**Testing:** More clove upfront than ginger. I can confirm that both spicies feel authentic, it gives you the right spicy note without scratching your throat out and I was surprised that it didn't feel dry at all. The big down side of this flavor is that there's no bakery notes at all, just pure ginger and clove. No off-notes present.\n\n**Pairings:** Floral profiles, tea's, bakery's and tobaccos.\n\n**Usage:** Overall I recommend this around at 0.25-0.5% since it's very concentrated. Tried at 0.75% but it started to get very dry and the clove even more upfront.\n\n**Conclusions:** There's no much to say unfortunely. It's ginger and clove. CAP Gingerbread is still my favorite and there's no comparison with this one.\n\n**More information:**http://www.inawerawinkel.com/CONCENTRATE-GINGERBREAD/1740/?i=en  \n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n**INW Miss Cream**  \nTested at: 0.5%, 1%, 2% / 2 weeks steep.\n\n**First Impressions:** One the nose I get fudge, a mild artificial vanilla mixture with heavy cream. The fudge is more prominent than the rest.\n\n**Testing:**That artificial vanilla note is messing the overall flavor. The cream is very dense to the point it makes your mouth with a 'heavy feeling', there's no dairy notes and it's way dry for my taste. Only thing I find positive is the fudge note which it's sticky and authentic. There's a dark caramel note somewhat similar to FA Caramel and a very mild dark chocolate note.\n\n**Pairings:** Custard's, bakery's and maybe tobaccos?\n\n**Usage:** Between 0.5%-1.5%. At low percentages, the vanilla is not so present which is good and allows the fudge to be more upfront. Upping the percentages, that dense cream starts to come out. I still tried to play with this with INW Custard and CAP VCv1 and the cream just messes with all.\n\n**Conclusions:** I really don't know what to do with this one. The vanilla note really messes me up.\n\n**More information:** http://www.inawerawinkel.com/CONCENTRATE-MISS-CREAM/1701/?i=en\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n**INW Rumble Crumble**  \nTested at: 2%, 3% / 2 weeks steep.\n\n**First Impressions:** On the nose, a mix of cranberry and blackcurrant, both authentic, cooked and warm. Not jammy. I get some kind of a baked cookie note too.\n\n**Testing:** Just like my first impressions, both the cranberry and the blackcurrant creates a beautiful bond. It doesn't give me a jammy or a syrup type flavour, just a slightly cooked and warm comfort fruit. The crust/cookie/crumble note is also noticeable but only in high wattages. FA Apple Pie helps a lot here to bring more that bakery note upfront. There's a light cinnamon note too but barely present.\n\n**Pairings:**Other fruits, bakery's, custards, tea's or other floral profiles.\n\n**Usage:** Between 2-3% seems the right spot. Didn't get any off notes and overall seems balanced. The downside of this flavour is if you want to make a crumble with other kind of fruits or only the crumble part, you'll get that cranberry and blackcurrant right on your face. So it's a very limited flavour.\n\n**More information:** http://www.inawerawinkel.com/CONCENTRATE-RUMBLE-CRUMBLE/1737/?i=en\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n**INW Yes We Cheesecake**  \nTested at: 2%, 3% / 2 weeks steep.\n\n**First Impressions:** On the nose, you really get what's supposed to be. This indeed represents an authentic European cheesecake. The cream cheese? Checked. The crunchy biscuit base? Checked too!\n\n**Testing:** Starting with the base. It's present and it's combined with the body of the flavour. It's cooked perfectly and it feels like it just came out of the oven. The cream cheese filling is on point! It tastes just like the Philadelphia (brand) cream cheese. You get the cheesiness of the cream cheese but it's not gross and it doesn't muddle the complexity of the flavour.\nThe cream component complements the rest.\n\n**Pairings:** Fruits and bakery's.\n\n**Usage:** Beetween 2-3.5% seems the right spot.\n\n**Conclusions:** If you enjoy cheesecake profiles, give this a try. This stands out compared to other cheesecakes like CAP NY, LA Cheesecake or TPA Cheesecake (Graham Crust), but this one I don't consider a cheesecake, more the base of one.\n\n**More information:** http://www.inawerawinkel.com/YES-WE-CHEESECAKE/1734/?i=en\n\n**Other topics in Reddit:**\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/6swmmj/inawera_yes_we_love_cheesecake_prepremiere_test/\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/86dxdx/inw_yes_we_cheesecake/\n\nPS: Sorry if I misplaced some words but English is not my primary language.",

It smells like peanut butter, the absolute essence of peanuts, but I must admit that it's REALLY freaking concentrated, and I'm getting some chemical off notes there. But.. generally peanuts it is. Just it. This kind-of earthy, peanut smell.\n\n\n**The inhale.**\n\nThe throat hit is mild, and as for the flavor when inhaling, for me there's this taste similar to an aftertaste when swallowing peanuts. Sounds funny maybe, but yeah, that is it for me.\n\n**The exhale.**\n\nThroat hit is there, but not overly hard. This flavor is so rich, I mean, it represents peanuts so well that I really don't have much to add there. But it lacks some complexity to it.. on the other hand, peanuts is peanuts, right? What should I expect?\nThe flavor really reminds me of peanut butter.\nIn higher concentrations I'm getting really nasty chemical off-notes though, real unpleasant. This stuff is so efficient that 2% is actually a lil bit too much for me. Beyond this point, it starts to taste bitter and full on artificial. Kinda like burned plastic.\n\n**Uses and pairings:** I've tried to combine it with banana flavor and a lil bit of cheesecake, works well for me. Maybe could be good with a jelly flavor? Definetly would recommend mixing it with tobacco and creamy/dessert mixes. Solo it's just peanuts.\n\n**Personal testing notes**: 1-2% is fine. Tastes slightly milder when steeping for a few days. DO NOT GO BEYOND 2%, you will become a peanut and die a painful death.\n\n**Second opinions:** One friend says it's great, \"zajebiste orzeszki\" which means \"freaking good peanuts\" and vapes it all day, the other one.. well, not so much.\n\n\n**Summary:** Really efficient and balanced flavor, represents the real deal quite well, but one has to be careful with percentage, because adding too much will pretty much destroy the mix and turn your set into mobile meth lab when it comes to smell. I couldn't stand it when I added to much.\n\n\nquestions/co-op/review propositions: mrgvape@gmail.com\n\nZniżki na idym.eu/idym.eu discounts: enter YWJJ7KN5 code during checkout",

Dense mouthfeel and very nicely balanced between the sweet and savory aspects. On the exhale there’s a nice of bit vanilla peeking through.

This will work great as a cookie or pastry type base right around 2-3%. Use at .5-1% for a nice toasty biscuit accent, adds some body with its buttery style. This is concentrated stuff just like most of JF’s line; but this IMO is not as strong as INW biscuit.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** JF Boysenberry @ 3%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 16 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Bright berry with peach at lower percentages. Good sweetness without a whole lot of juice. Berry note tastes like a mix of blackcurrant and raspberry.\n\nInhale is light fragrant peach. Exhale still has that peach note, but the berry is underneath that. Berry itself is lighter, and just a bit tart.  Light, almost natural tasting sweetness with a fairly thin and dry body.  The tail end of the exhale is mostly green underripe peach and just a hint of caramel.  Little bit of a sticky mouth feel with prolonged use.\n\n**Off-flavors:** At higher percentages especially, tastes a fair bit like underripe peaches.  Not bad, but a little weird.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Light, little bit of throat tightness.  Ramps up a bit at higher percentage.  Nothing out of line for a fruit.  The peach note makes me think it would be something to watch for varying sensitivities.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Fruit mixes. That brightness is going to mix well maybe one other bright fruit and other jammier, darker fruits.\nYou could exploit that peach note by adding something in to boost it like JF Honey Peach, FLV Peach or FLV Mango.  If you wanted to push the berries, FLV Boysenberry, TFA Sweet Raspberry, FA Blackcurrant, or FA Raspberry.\n\nI'm just spitballing here, but the berry and peach kind of reminds me of a fancy belini, so maybe FW Pink Champagne.\n\nThat green note is pretty subtle, so it should blend well with creams.  Punchy enough for bakeries, although the peach in here will get a bit confusing.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nS&V concentration testing, this seems to be best under 1%.  That peach is relatively balanced with berry and isn't floral or perfumey.  Any higher than that and the peach muscles in quite a bit more.  2% is still nice and non-floral, but that peach is right up front.  Anything above that seems like overkill and gets floral and too green.  I'd mix at 1% if you're avoiding a clear peach and 2% if that's what you're going for, man.\n\nSo I thought I had screwed up and mixed this tester up with JF Honey Peach.  I did not, they are definitely different.  The peach note is a bit of a mystery for me, but with that said it's not bad but just unexpected.  Unless they have somehow mislabelled my actual bottle of concentrate, which I guess is an option.  Or, alternatively I'm completely wrong and my taste buds are broken.\n\nJungle flavors seems to target specific concentrates, so I also mixed up some FLV Boysenberry thinking that they were trying to aim for that. It's radically different. FLV has a much stronger sweet berry note with a jammier, syrup taste.\n\nPerfectly fine flavor, just a bit mislabelled as far I can tell.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nYeah, not really.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Jungle Flavors Cactus, 1 and 4%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 13 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  More like an actual prickly pear than INW's wonder texturizer.\n\nI'd say the flavor here is fairly close to an actual prickly pear rather than the greener slightly more cactus-y INW .  It's slightly vegetal, but ultimately more of a fruit flavor.  Leads with something like a white grape or lychee flavor, then you get some additional almost guavaish sweetness to it as it warms up a bit.  Finishes with a relatively heavy white part of the watermelon rind flavor.  If you look at a prickly pear recipe like ID10-T's [Bare Necessities](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/26487#bare_necessities_by_id10_t), this is hitting most of those kind of notes.  It actually reminds me a whole lot of a slightly less juicy version of FW Prickly Pear, but without the coil-wrecking / cancer-ish sugar syrup.\n\nThis definitely has some green to it, but it's noticeably less green than INW Cactus.  Where the INW cactus can get a bit swampy and darkly vegetal, this is a lighter, crisper green more akin to cucumber peel or watermelon rind.  Almost has a bit of an underripe pear kind of tartness attached to that light green note. \n\nOverall sweetness level is pretty realistic.  Definitely comes across as a fruit but doesn't go full bubblegum like some of the prickly pear flavorings in beverage blends. Texture-wise, this doesn't really do the same crazy juiciness things that INW Cactus does.  It's maybe a bit dry, and takes on a slightly \"popsicle-stick\" kind of woodiness like TPA Cucumber.  Instead of being really deep and juicy, it's a bit light and sticky.  There's some of that filmy, slightly slick HFCS kind of texture to the sweetness here.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Nothing unpleasant or chemical.  Gets a bit too green at higher percentages.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  This actually has a little bit of slightly dry harshness to it.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 1%, this is maybe feeling a bit dry and thin.  I'm getting most of that melon rind greeness here, without much of the sweeter fruit.  There's a bit of tartness here as well. Flavor seems a bit top-heavy here.\n\nAt 4%  The sweetness here is quite a bit fuller and I'm getting a whole lot more of those grape and guava type fruity notes.  Texture is a bit thicker, although it still doesn't have that crazy deep juiciness of INW.\n\nJust based on these tests, I don't think is going to work a whole lot like INW cactus.  I'd probably be a bit on the high side with this, around 2% for an accent or up to 3-3.5% as a primary flavor.  The green here is subtle enough you don't really have to worry about it taking over recipes.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I don't think this is quite a direct sub for INW Cactus, as it doesn't have the same textural effect.  I'd use it more as an actual prickly pear flavor.\n\nSince it's one of those complex collections of sort of identifiable fruit flavors, I think the way this comes across in a recipe is going to vary pretty dramatically based on what it pairs up against.\n\nI could see this being used with cucumbers or something else kind of vegetal to sweeten those up without coming across as completely cloying.\n\nTPA Dragonfruit would probably work well to really accentuate some of that bubblegum note from actual prickly pear.  CAP Sweet Guava would probably do largely the same thing, although without as much textural baggage.\n\nShould work really well with juicier apple or especially pear flavors.\n\nI could see using this with grapes and kind of taking advantage of the slightly more vegetal back end to make a more realistic grape flavor.\n\nFWIW, this also pairs really well with INW Cactus for a fuller, juicier prickly pear.\n\nProbably a bit green for using with creams, so maybe tread lightly there, but overall it should fit in with just about any fruit you throw in there.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  I can't really find much in the way of reviews out there.\n\n[Here's the product page at ECX.](http://www.ecigexpress.com/shop/diy-e-liquid/diy-e-liquid-flavors/jungle-flavors/fruit-and-sweet/cactus-by-jungle-flavors.html)  Their description is: \"Cactus by Jungle Flavors possess a uniquely delicious taste that is often described as tart and slightly sweet.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Jungle Flavors Cherry @ 1% and 2.5%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 6 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Artificial \"red\" cherry, with most of the usual weird plastic/medicinal type notes that are common with cherries.  Kind of like cherry cough drops with the plastic still on. Some decent candy sweetness and brighter cherry flavor here, but it's pretty buried under the medicinal / gasoline / plastic notes. Not quite as gnarly as some other artificial cherries, but it definitely isn't the artificial cherry magic bullet.  Seems a bit weak side compared to the more commonly used Jungle Flavors, cherry flavor itself works fine up to about 4%, but those off notes come right along with it.\n\nInhale has that red candy cherry with a bitter medicinal edge. Some good candy cherry sweetness that builds through the inhale but that medicinal note builds right along side. Just a bit on the airy side, lacking of a lot of density or juiciness. Exhale has more of that fairly credible artificial cherry up front for a fraction of a second but then you run right into all those off flavors. Crosses from medicinal into full plastic-y on the exhale. Again, nobody has really nailed a candy cherry without off-flavors so it's not unexpected, but it's always a bummer. Entire vape is on the dry side and fairly airy. Not as dry and airy as INW Cherries, but way more off-flavors than that one. Sweetness level isn't overwhelming or cloying, actually seems like it's maybe a hair undersweet for that \"red\" cherry kind of taste.  Lingering bitter plastic-y notes.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  It's a cherry flavor, so a whole bunch. Alternatively medicinal or plasticy depending on where you are in the inhale and exhale.  Plastic notes are a little intense than a fuller more \"realistic\" cherry flavor, but still pretty gnarly and the drier, airier texture makes them pretty off-putting.\n \n**Throat Hit:**  Not too bad actually. The off-flavors are pretty rough, but they don't seem to be adding too much to actual throat hit. They just don't taste great.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  More than anything else, this seems like the halfway ground between the thin, dry INW Cherries that doesn't really have any off-notes but still isn't a solo cherry to a deeper cherry like FA Cherry that is fuller but pretty aggressive in it's off flavors.\n\nIf these kind of off-notes don't bother you, then go nuts. It's an artificial cherry flavor that would probably work in beverages so there's something to counter some of the dryness here.\n\nPersonally, It's being relegated to a shelf until I can get up the willpower to toss the flavors I'm probably never going to use again. Full cherry concentrates just largely aren't that good. Shoutout to Medicine Flower, because otherwise you're pretty much SOL unless you want to cobble your own together.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, this seems really linear including the off-flavors. 1% feels too light for me.  I get a hint of cherry and a hint of plastic and not too much else. 2% is a bit more solid, but still on the light side overall. 3% is starting to taste pretty full. Decent, if thin artificial cherry taste but pretty solidly medicinal. 4% is getting pretty plastic-y but the cherry flavor underneath is actually fairly full. 5% is just straight plastic to me, with a bit of a floral edge to keep things interesting.\n\nSo, I'm pretty sure this is one of the concentrates orphaned when Ecigexpress either bought or started working more closely with Jungle Flavors. I got this from Chef's in the UK, and it doesn't appear to be available in the US.  That's a pretty good sign this concentrate isn't long for this world. ID10-T wanted me to take another run at tilting at the \"solo cherry flavor that isn't kind of garbage\" windmill, and this isn't it. I'm not thinking anyone is going to shed any tears when this disappears.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nI'm working under the assumption that this was, at one point, branded \"Jungle Flavorz.\" The replacement of the \"z\" was probably a good choice.\n\n[User \"Sdh\" on ECF reports: \"A more real tasting Cherry but light at 2%. To me it tastes like the Cherry in a Diet Rite Cherry cola. It does present with a slight sweetness. At this percent I do not detect a acidic taste. I find it a clean Cherry.

It carries itself well with no dryness.\"](https://www.e-cigarette-forum.com/forum/threads/jungle-flavorz-german-flavoring-discussion-reviews-and-what-not.505646/)  Not really my experience with it, but hey.

Main flavor of this is dark caramel/Maple syrup with a faint bakery note in the back.  kinda reminds me of a soggy stroopwafel. needs more of a bite to the cookie.\n\n**After 3 week Steep**\n\nI feel the flavor died a bit.  During the inhale you get some unflavored sweetness, and during the exhale you get a faded maple syrup/bakery note.  Aftertaste has a slight alcohol note.  The pancake syrup aroma after the exhale is gone as well.  I really should have tested this at a higher %.\n\n**Possible Pairings**\n\nI can see this be used as a base in a pacake/waffle/french toast/Stroopwafel recipe. it's pretty muddled and flat in each area, but that allows stronger and brighter flavors, like FA Cookie, FA maple syrup, INW waffle, to be brought in and still have a homogenized taste.  \n\n**Other Stuffs:** \n\nCame up with an idea the other day to post up my ever growing list of flavors up on google sheets so you guys can check it out and suggest what flavors I should test and post notes on.

Extremely dense 10/10\n\n**Throat Hit**\n3/10\n\n**Flavor Properties**\n\n\nThis flavoring can be broken down into several different parts Dairy, Caramel, and vanilla.\n\nCaramel - simply put delicious, light and sweet all still adding a heavy candy flavoring. There is a slight nutty flavor to the caramel that helps fill the flavoring out and gives it a unique quality.\n\nVanilla - the vanilla and this pairs perfectly with the sweet caramel. Accentuating the sweetness and taking the Nutty candy flavor to the next level.\n\nDairy - a heavy creamy Dairy, getting the flavor is smooth finish. Adding a very chewy aspect to the flavoring. The dairy aspect of this I believe is what makes it such a thick flavoring.\n\n**Relatable Flavors**\n\nSoft chewy caramel or even caramel ice cream topping.\n\n**Position In The Recipe**\n\nYou can see this flavor you being used in many applications it has the density to be a base flavor. Could easily be used to accent other candies, especially caramel, and butterscotch. And it is strong enough to come across as a top note at high percentages \n\n**Off Flavors**\n\n Jungle flavors seems to be killing it with very accurate and usable flavorings. I could not find anything wrong with this flavoring.\n\n**Pairings**\n\nI can see this pairing with almost everything. Should play nicely with all other candies. Add a little something unique  two tobacco's like soho and ry4. Creams and  bakeries should pair extremely well. Spice flavorings such as vanilla cardamom cinnamon or even anise.\n\n**Notes**\n\n\nAlright what is Dulce de leche? Basically it is sweetened milk, the sugars in the milk have been lightly caramelized turning it into a very rich and creamy caramel flavor.\n\nThis is going to be a versatile flavoring all of us should have in our Arsenal. I have been looking for the perfect light Caramel and I believe this is a likely candidate. Even though this flavor is incredibly dense  the caramel flavoring is not too heavy, on top of that it is creamy giving you that nice soft chewy  caramel drizzle. \n\nMixers of all experience levels should find this flavoring very useful. And definitely going to be needing a larger bottle 10 milliliters is just going to go so fast.\n\n**Rating**\n99/100\n\nOne last thing ECX is only selling this in 10 milliliter bottles, this flavoring is fantastic, and it is my understanding was almost discontinued. let's make sure that doesn't happen. Order yours today, thank me later. While you're at it please request they start selling this flavoring in larger amounts.\nWill be doing a more comprehensive review for DOD subscribers.",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Jungle Flavors Fresh Cream, 1 and 4%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 16 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Accurate, smooth cream, a whole lot like the FA Version.\n\nPretty spot on to a heavy-ish cream flavor.  Light buttery note but no butyric or really heavy dairy flavors.  Some light tartness, but it's mostly from the bottom heavy nature of the flavor.  Doesn't really seem to be interacting with the flavor, I think I'm mostly just tasting my testing base.  Doesn't come across as crazy rich or thick, utility cream without any weirdness or off-flavors.\n\nSmooth mouthfeel and a flatter texture. Basically no top notes, and a moderately thick middle and base to the flavor.  Doesn't cross into a fluffier whipped cream.  Just a touch sweeter than straight cream, but doesn't have any heavy artificial feeling sweetness.\n\nSo if you put this side by side with FA Fresh Cream I'd really have trouble telling the difference.  The flavor here is really similar.  I'd say the JF version is just a hair more tart, but that could easily be my older bottle of FA.  Texture-wise, again, it feels pretty identical.  I think the middle of the FA is maybe a touch thicker but the base is pretty indistinguishable.  I think the primary difference is going to be the concentration, it feels like FA is just a bit more concentrated.  All of these differences could easily be explained by age of the concentrate or even how tightly the bottles seal.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Nah, not really.  Using FA as a benchmark, nothing that doesn't belong in there.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Nah, not really.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  Not a great solo vape, but at 1% I'm getting a light, flat cream flavor.  Not a lot of sweetness, and just a bit of body.  Mouthfeel still feels just a bit thin.\n\nAt 4%, quite a bit more volume and I'm getting light buttery notes.  Still nothing that tastes particularly butryic to me. Still feels pretty flat.  Seems to be drying out just a bit.\n\nJust given these tests, I'd probably be around 1.5% as an accent, and 3% as primary flavor.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This is about as close to a direct sub for a flavor as I've tested from different manufacturers, so this would basically slot in any recipe with FA Fresh Cream at basically the same percentage if not a touch more.\n\nPretty versatile overall.  Useful for a milk type base without any of the more aggressive dairy notes present in some of the milk flavors.  Mellow enough to not really stand out at low percentages against drier profiles while smoothing things out.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  Again, I'm not finding much out there.\n\n[Here's the product page from ECX.](http://www.ecigexpress.com/shop/diy-e-liquid/diy-e-liquid-flavors/jungle-flavors/fresh-cream-by-jungle-flavors.html)  Their description: \"Fresh Cream from Jungle boasts creamy dairy notes that pair well with just about any fruit and dessert recipes.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** JF Honey Peach @ 3%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 22 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** A relatively fleshy ripe / bordering on overripe peach. Pronounced green top notes, slightly perfumey overall, especially at higher percentages. Overall the concentrate has some juiciness but it feels strangely disjointed in the mix, almost divorced from the actual peach itself. The peach itself is a little dry. Sweetness is all down low in the flavor and front-loaded.\n\nInhale is heavy on perfume with a warm moderately dense juicyness and a solid sweetness. Exhale starts with a green peach / peel note moving onto more of the peach flesh. Some sweetness here, but all underneath the peach instead of actually in the flesh. Finish is clean, almost to point of tasting a little metallic.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  People report a raw honey taste here.  I personally don't get much of that, but YMMV.  I do get some metallic notes on the finish of the exhale, but damn near any other concentrate is going to have a lot more going on there and should take care of that when mixed.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Light, mostly in the form of chest tightness for me. Still much less pronounced than TPA Juicy Peach.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**\n\nPlenty of use out there already. My mind immediately goes to fruit mixes, just because of that dryer peel green note and needing some extra juiciness in the exhale. [/u/Philosaphucker uses it in their \"Kicking Rocks\" recipe right here.](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/16857#kicking_rocks_by_philosaphucker) Balanced with hazelnut, fig, pear, and blackcurrant.  [And again in their \"Nova\", with grapefruit, cactus, pear, and plum.](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/16868#nova_by_philosaphucker)\n\n\nThis peach note here would also work in beverages. [u/philosaphucker is obviously an ECX shill, with a awfully fine Peach bourbon recipe named \"Noted Talks.\"](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/15261#noted_talks_by_philosaphucker)  Similar to FLV Peach, this would a great fit for an Iced Tea as well.\n\n[Some use in bakeries, notably \"A Southern Peach\" by /u/trevorxgage.](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/16817#a_southern_peach_v1_by_trevorxgage) They cut that green note by using Kentucky Bourbon and Liquid Amber to cook the peach here.\n\nIt's worth noting that this concentrate may not play well with heavy creams and custards. [/u/EdibleMalfunction goes into this here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/53ozts/honey_peach_jf_issues/)\n\n**Notes:**\n\nS&V concentration testing, this seems pretty desaturated at .5% although I do get most of the juicyness at a low concentration. I get a denser stone fruit vibe at 1% and then the \"peachyness\" kind of scales up with some perfumey notes.  I'd mix at .5% for more of a fruity enhacement, 1% for a distinct peach in a mix, and maybe 1.5% as a primary note. If you can get the green notes under control, this is probably good a bit higher than that.\n\nThis is weird for me, it feels like the concentrate is sort of backwards. I get what I'd expect on the exhale on the inhale instead. It's a good peach flavor though, just watch where it's sitting in your mixes.  This is a case where the consensus seems to be quite a bit more positive than my notes.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nQuite a few quick mentions on reddit about it being good. [Here,](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/336wze/anyone_tried_jungle_flavors/) [here,](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/46m5f0/jungle_flavors_at_ecx/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/2o7fp1/ecigexpress_who_makes_signature_flavors/) are some examples.\n\n[Positive, not particulary descriptive reviews on ECX. The flavor description by ECX is helpful, although it talks about a clear honey note that I just don't get.](http://www.ecigexpress.com/diy-e-liquid/diy-e-liquid-flavors/jungle-flavors/honey-peach-by-jungle-flavors.html)\n\n[Downright reasonable single flavor percentage advice on ELR, and an actual note about this being an authentic peach flavor.](http://www.ecigexpress.com/diy-e-liquid/diy-e-liquid-flavors/jungle-flavors/honey-peach-by-jungle-flavors.html)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

    "markdown": "**JF(Jungle Flavors) Lemon Juicy**  \n*Summary*  \nThis is a nice, natural, sweet lemon flavor. It's not necessarily tart, or bitter, or acidic; just a straight up sweet lemon flavor. It's almost reminiscent of those lemon drop candies, but less artificial tasting. I can see this working very well in bakeries, candies, and beverage flavors. The first place my palate wants to take this is like a lemon meringue pie. I've tried this at 1%, 3%, and 5%. 3% seems to be the cap, 1% was a little too weak, and 5% I didn't get anything extra out of it than I did at 3%. This flavoring oughtn't need to steep as it's a fruit, seems to be low in acids, and has an inherent sweetness about it.  \n\n**Single Flavor Testing Notes**  \n\n*5/29\nshake-n-vape* \n\nRight away I notice Juicy Lemon doesn't seem to cloud up a mix like FA Lemon Sicily or other citruses, possibly due to a lower citric acid content.  \n\nOn the nose I get kind of a sweet lemon, almost reminiscent of those lemon drop candies.  \n\n@3% this is a really nice lemon flavor. It's not bitter or tart or anything just straight lemon. Sweet too, almost like a lemon candy but not artificial.  \n\n@5% not gaining anything extra from it than I did at 3% so I'm thinking 3% is going to be a cap for this flavoring  \n\n@1% The lemon is just barely there, not prominent enough to be noticeable even in a mix methinks. \n",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Jungle Flavors Marshmallow, 1 and 4%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 15 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Pretty much a cereal marshmallow.\n\nThe vanilla here is fairly prominent.  It's kind of continuing the cereal marshmallow theme, with a brighter one-dimensional vanilla.  Closest to something like a straight vanillin flavor with no real darker or spicier accents to it.  There's also some maltiness here, it almost tastes dusted in some of the crushed up cereal itself.  There's also just a light bit of chemical twinge at higher percentages, but it's pretty subtle at usable percentages.\n\nThis has a drier texture, almost feels a bit crunchy rather than soft and chewy.  Moderate volume, but that dryness feels a lot more like a meringue than a straight campfire marshmallow.  True to profile, this is fairly sweet.  Seems pretty appropriate for a cereal style marshmallow.\n\nTrying to place this in the constellation of available marshmallow flavors, feels the most similar to the flavorah version.  Both this and flavorah marshmallow have that drier cereal marshmallow vibe.  I think the vanilla here is a bit brighter and more artificial than the flavorah version, and that one seems to have just a bit deeper body to it.  The actual vanilla note here pushes closer to that CAP New Marshmallow, but not nearly as chemical and weird.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Bright vanilla has quite a bit of malt and some light chemical notes.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light.  Not nearly the same kind of smooth as TPA, but nothing unduly harsh here.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 1% I'm getting some volume out of this, with a bit of bright vanilla.  Not much depth to the flavor, and almost a powdered sugar dryness on the edges.  Doesn't really jump out as a marshmallow, cereal or otherwise here.\n\nAt 4% this has gone full lucky charms on me.  Vanilla is bright, texture is kind of dessicated, and I'm getting that malty note pretty clearly.  A bit thicker than 1%, but not quite dense.\n\nJust based on these tests, I'd probably use this at 2.5-3% if you want it to actually taste like a marshmallow.  Just trying to use it a sweetener, I'd probably be around 1.5% in candy profiles and closer to 1% with fruits and stuff.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:** The most natural fit for this would be just running with the cereal marshmallow thing.  Pretty good option for a cereal milk or a roll your own lucky charms type of vape.\n\nThis probably isn't the kind of marshmallow you would use to knock the sharp edges off a recipe or to add volume and texturize a recipe.  This doesn't have a lot of the neutral volume and muting of something like TPA.\n\nUsing this with fruits is going to come across like sprinkling powdered sugar on top.  I think this would have some use like FA Meringue, but without that heavier bakery taste and the light eggy notes.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  Again, I'm not finding much out there.\n\n[Here's the product page from ECX.](http://www.ecigexpress.com/shop/diy-e-liquid/diy-e-liquid-flavors/jungle-flavors/fruit-and-sweet/marshmallow-by-jungle-flavors.html)  Their description: \"Enjoy the sweet , simple taste of fluffy marshmallows in your next DIY recipe with Marshmallow from Jungle flavors!

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Jungle Flavors Tiramisu, 1 and 4%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 14 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  A drier and less funky take on Tiramisu.\n\nSo, this is fairly coffee forward.  It's a darker espresso style coffee.  It tastes a little burnt, but not wholly incinerated like the worst offenders in the burnt-popcorn kind of off-flavor category.  Espresso is at the front on the concentrate, and occupies most of the top notes.  There's theoretically some cocoa in here, complicating some of that darkness in that coffee, but I have to go looking for it.  Mostly works as an added dark note against all that espresso.\n\nThe rest of the tiramisu is a little more subdued.  I do get quite a bit of pretty accurate ladyfingers kind of bakery in here.  It's a bit dry but it mostly stays in its place and doesn't seem to fluffy or dominant against the coffee.  I can't really find much in the way of cream here.  There's a light tartness that maybe feels like the start of a pastry cream, but it doesn't really have much thickness or body to it.  I don't pick up any distinct vanilla or eggyness to that cream, but there is a lot going on here and it may just be getting a bit lost.\n\nThis isn't an overly sweet concentrate, which is probably a fit for the profile.  There's definitely some dessert style sweetness, but it's tempered pretty effectively by that aggressive coffee and the dryness of the pastry.  Because of the lack of cream, this actually comes off a bit dry.  The darker parts of the coffee and the cocoa lean a little dry, and that drier ladyfinger base doesn't really help.  Mostly dry in comparison to FA, but probably worth noting.\n\nComparing this FA Booster / Tiramisu, their definitely trying to hit similar profiles.  Both have that darker, espresso kind of coffee note although I feel like the espresso in the JF version is a tad lighter and a bit less overdone.  While I'm definitely still getting a bit of that burnt popcorn it's not as prominent as it is in the FA Version.  If FA Booster is a 7 out of 10 for coffee weirdness, I'd call this maybe a 4.  I do feel like the rest of tiramisu is maybe a bit more developed in the FA version though.  The cream note is much more prominent in the FA, and I feel like the actual pastry component seems a bit more fleshed out because of it.  Their isn't much cream to the JF and it sort of feels more like dry ladyfingers as opposed to a full, composed dessert.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  It's fairly coffee-forward, so theres a bit of that weird buttery burnt off-note to it, but it's relatively restrained compared to some of the darker coffee flavors.  Beyond that, a bit dry for a tiramisu and missing some of the creamier notes. I know ragging on bakeries for having lemon in them is a FA thing, but there is some tartness here that feels a bit out of place.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light.  The pastry part of this can get a bit throaty and dry, but nothing too major.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 1% this is strangely tart and a bit thin. Coffee flavor here is light, and I get some dry pastry notes, but I'm not getting much distinct cocoa and almost no creamier component.  Feels pretty underflavored.\n\nAt 4%, this is quite a bit more pleasant. Coffee is a bit deeper and you pick out some of the cocoa nuance.  Pastry base feels thicker and somehow less dry, but that doesn't really equate to a more discrete cream component.\n\nJust based on these tests, I'd probably be around 1.5% as an accent or 3% for a primary flavor.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I think maybe FA is a better single flavor tiramisu flavor, but this might be a bit easier to mix with.\n\nThe coffee here is a bit less burnt, so it should fairly well in actual coffee beverage profiles with a whole bunch of cream to kind of soften up those ladyfingers.  I think the lack of eggy notes from a heavy custard is actually a good thing for usability in coffee beverage profiles, as those tend to bring the burnt notes in coffee up a bit by contrast.\n\nIf you wanted to turn this into your own tiramisu, I'd look at heavier custards like CAP or INW, and bonus points if you bring in some HS Italian Cream for some of that marscapone flavor.\n\nPretty solid choice for the base of a coffee bakery.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  Again, I'm not finding much out there.\n\n[Here's the product page from ECX.](http://www.ecigexpress.com/shop/diy-e-liquid/diy-e-liquid-flavors/jungle-flavors/fruit-and-sweet/tiramisu-by-jungle-flavors.html)  Their description: \"Enjoy a pick me up with Tiramisu from Jungle Flavors!

    "markdown": "Ok so ecig express has been busy cranking out some flavors. I haven't had a chance to try them all and dont have them all in front of me. \n\nOne flavor that stood out was Pink Burst, which I can only  assume is pink starburst or strawberry taffy. \n\nTo be blunt: I think this might be jungle flavors version of Capellas strawberry taffy flavor, but haven't actually tried that one. I did notice I had some other Jungle Flavors that seemed like renditions of other popular choices such as biscuit and Fuji. Those two  struck me as smelling better than their original counterparts. This isn't the first time I've seen manufacturers release similar flavors such as fa's soho which seems like a clone of INW's scamel. Competition between manufacturers benefits consumers. \n\nOn to the review...\n\nPink Burst 2% in 70/30 vg/pg on dual coil low resistance rda\n\nHmm I don't really like  Pink starburst (I ate some last week) but this actually tastes better than the candy. I Still get a. Strawberry taffy/candy taste from this. However on my setup the vape is warm, and warm starburst flavor is kinda weird to vape.\n\nKoolada might help that. \nOddly enough I like the strawberry banana starburst and have high hopes for  recreating that.\nMy girlfriend loves pink Starburst so this flavor is definitely a winner in my book. however it's not a single flavor vape to me and that's fine. \n\nECX accomplished what they set out to do on this one.  It's good, but I feel like they really hit the ball out of the park with their juicy lemon flavor. They also offer a regular strawberry flavor that was decent, but ultimately didn't stand out to me vs the other manufacturers out there which are all really similar. \n\n\nI might try 3% for dripping higher VG mixes.\n\nSorry for the weird formatting Im doing this on the phone.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** JF Pomegranate Orange @ 3%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 17 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  At low percentages, a candy blood orange flavor with the blood part of the orange pushing toward sweet-tarts. At a higher percentage, pink bubblegum flouride treatments. \n\nInhale is sweet citrus, A blood orange flavor as opposed to something like a navel orange. Sweeter than real blood orange and the \"blood\" part is pretty mild. Relatively soft zest flavor builds through the inhale.  Sweet pomegranate top note is right up front on the exhale lacking most of the tartness of real pomegranate but with a candy sweet-tarts taste.  Medium dense and almost chalky.  You have a decent fleshy orange underneath that with quite a bit of sweetness and some juiciness.  The overall effect tastes a whole lot like pink bubblegum through the first half of the exhale.  The tartness comes through on the back end of the exhale just as that pomegranate note thins out substantially, leaving you with a odd not quite astringent medicinal flavor.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Flouride.  It's the weirdest thing, but overall this tastes like (and smells like after its vaped) like dentist office flouride rinses.  Maybe it's just a specific sense memory for me, but this is dead on for that at 3%.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Light, mostly a tightness in the throat on exhale.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Under 1% I think the ecx reviews are dead on and this would work for a sweet-tart.  Definitely a candy flavor. Most of your candy texturizers are going to work well on that flouride finish. That chalky note is going to be the deal breaker on mixing this with other fruits, creams, or bakeries.\n\nAbove 1%, This may have a use in your classic pink bubblegum or even like a fruit stripe flavor but that flouride flavor is going to be a bear to work around.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nS&V testing, percentage used is important.  The orange part of this is present and recognizable at 1%, while the pomegranate / blood orange and the attendant chalky candy taste isn't unpleasant.  Definitely present, but still manageable.  Over 1% though and that flouride comes through really clearly while the orange gets a bit muted.  I'd stick to mixing this at 1% or under, using this as your primary flavor note with other concentrates contributing more to mouthfeel and texture.  You may be able to get away with a sweeter candy strawberry or raspberry if you want to push this into a mixed berry flavor, although the chalky-ness is going to make it taste quite a bit like mixed berry Tums antacids.\n\nThis is definitely a bit odd.  It's not really in my wheelhouse, but I can see people being into candy vapes getting some mileage out of this.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Not really, although the ECX reviews are hilarious.](http://www.ecigexpress.com/diy-e-liquid/diy-e-liquid-flavors/jungle-flavors/pomegranate-orange-by-jungle-flavors.html) Two people swearing off Jungle Flavors forever after this didn't work at 18 and 20%, and then everything else just calling them dense.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Jungle Flavors RY4 Double, 1 and 4%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 17 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Mild dessert tobacco with heavy caramel and brown sugar sweetness.\n\nThis leads with a sticky, relatively full, soft caramel flavor.  More of a caramel sauce, with some light vanilla and a bit of buttery richness. There's also a deeper brown sugar kind of sweetness that doesn't get absorbed by that caramel.  You get a good deal of a molasses and some crispier caramelized sugar notes.  I get a bit of an errant, raisin fruity note out of it, but it works pretty well with all that brown sugar.\n\nThere is some actual tobacco in this concentrate, which mostly shows up after that initial burst of sweetness.  There's a pretty prominent dry hay note responsible for most of the throatiness of the concentrate, but I also get some darker tobacco leaf flavor.  There's almost a light cocoa edge to it up against all that sweetness and caramel.  The sweeter dessert portions of this tobacco definitely still headline but both those hay and dark tobacco notes are providing some solid accents especially on the tail end of the exhale.\n\nFairly full texture, especially with that caramel up front but doesn't seem to thin out too much at the end of the vape.  Moderate throat hit from those grassier notes, but the rest of the flavor is warm and smooth.  On balance, this is still an intensely sweet flavor but it's balanced a bit by the tobacco cleaning up some of that stickiness on the back end.\n\nThe primary competition here is TPA RY4 Double.  They are both trying to go after the same profile, and fundamentally resemble each other but the JF version definitely punches a little harder.  I think JF is a bit more concentrated, but really it's a deeper, fuller, and richer flavor.  TPA is mostly a dirty caramel, but the JF really accentuates the heavy brown sugar bordering on raisiny sweetness on top of that.  They have a similar kind of dry, warm throat hit, but the JF brings in some of the actual tobacco notes that are lacking in the TPA version.  Overall the JF version seems much closer to an enjoyable solo RY4.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Very caramel heavy and sweet for a tobacco.  Probably not going to remind you much of smoking anything tobacco related by itself.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Moderate, but it's a tobacco? Really unique kind of warm, almost scratchy throat hit that I don't really get anywhere else beyond this and TPA RY4.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 1%, this isn't really clicking . Sweetness is a little weak and one dimensional, not much caramel body or brown sugar nuance.  Still a grassy, dry throat hit but not much in the way of a tobacco taste to it.  Just a tiny bit watery instead of thick and smooth.\n\nAt 4% this is feeling pretty full.  Heavy richer mouthfeel.  Maybe a tiny bit thin for a caramel, but pretty full for a desert tobacco.  I'm also getting some really clear brown sugar notes with a slightly fruity caramelized edge.  Actual tobacco flavor is a bit easier to pick out on the back end as well.\n\nJust based on these tests, I'd probably be around 4% as a primary flavor, and maybe 2.5% as an accent, but the tobacco here blends really well in an accent role.  Just like the TPA version, a whole lot of this is going to be pretty subjective, and it doesn't really seem to have any off notes up at 6 and 8% as a S&V, but it's a bit too sticky and cloying for me that high.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Should work as a direct sub for TPA at a similar percentage.  Seems fuller rather than stronger per se at the same percentages, but maybe dial the JF back by .5% for a similar effect.\n\nSolid desert tobacco though, and could probably work as a solo or with a bit of more aggressive tobacco to fill it out.  In tobacco mixes, tends to drag stuff in a dessert pipe kind of direction, so maybe keep it away from your non-aromatic tobaccos if that isn't what you're going for.\n\nRY4 double pairs really well with apples and pears in general. Can also stand up to darker, juicier fruits.\n\nTobacco notes are pretty subtle, works well in desserts and creams or custards for that caramel note.  The tobacco in that application almost brings some savory earthiness to the profiles rather than comes across screaming \"THIS IS A TOBACCO VAPE.\"\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[ELR page is sparse.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/114150)  One note from user \"x47vapes\": \"Very good ry4 flavor. Stronger than tpa ry4 double.\"\n\n[Used in a couple of solid recipes on ATF.](https://alltheflavors.com/flavors/jungle-flavors-ry4-double)  Recipe notes for CokeCan's [\"root_kit.exe\"](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/26114#root_kit_exe_by_matthewkocanda) includes this description: \"It's great. I know I love FA Soho, but this shit is just as good. Soho is mild and light, while RY4 Double has a deeper and darker note to it with hints of caramel and wood... JF RY4 Double doesn't need much steeping to be good. There's no weirdness to it straight away, and it just improves and pushes itself to the front of recipes after steeping. This concentrate is also great for both sides of the tobacco spectrum. If you like that flavour in your recipes, you'll notice it's tobacco body and be satisfied. If you aren't trying to fuck with tobacco flavours, this one will fuck your mouth with bakery notes of brown sugar and caramel.\"\n\nWayne at DIYorDIE gave a quick comparison of three RY4s including TPA, FA, and JF.  His take was that JF is basically a more easily bullied version of TPA's.  [JF talk starts at 10:20](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNUEhwSYr94&t=10m20s)\n\n\n[Here's the product page from ECX.](http://www.ecigexpress.com/shop/diy-e-liquid/diy-e-liquid-flavors/jungle-flavors/tobacco/ry4-double-by-jungle-flavors.html)  Their description: \"Those who love tobacco, RY4 double is a must have for your flavor station! RY4’s flavor profile is that of premium tobacco with hints of sweet caramel. This flavor pairs wells with creams, some fruit, and savory flavors!\" I think they have the description completely backwards with the balance on caramel and tobacco. One five star review by hashslingingslashur titled: \"This is great. Tried at 3% solo its a good shake and vape but really hits its stride at 2 weeks. This is leaps and bounds better than TFA ry4 double, so much so that I will never buy the TFA version again. Do yourself a favor and buy this please. It's got the same caramel/burnt sugar vibe as TFA, not getting a ton of tobacco either but who cares. This is damn delicious and I will be building recipes around it.\ncould see this working anywhere you'd use the TFA version\"\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

I would buy any Strawberry direct of the shelves smelling like that. It’s exactly the smell of strawberries when they’re fully juicy and don’t need to ripen anymore. A hint of sweetness is in the air.\n\nA strawberry in great standing, I taste a light sweetness. There’s a hint of the typical acidity which could also turn a little greenish. Realistic representation of a strawberry so far of the shake.\n\nAfter 3 days the sweetness is more coming through and I taste a fully bodied ripe strawberry without any off notes and the fruity acidity is mellowed in. The juiciness is exactly what I expect from a realistic strawberry.\n\nIs it the ultimate strawberry? I can't say, but it gained enough of my love to work a little bit more with strawberries in the future. It is for sure one of the better ones and can be easily used in recipes over 4%, where I like it most.  \n\n**&#128313; Comments &#128313;**  \nAt the moment I have only seen it at Flavorjungle.com and in 30 ml  (and bigger) size.\n\nThere have been discussions if this can be used by strawberry mutes, which I can't judge and I didn't read any confirmation. If you have tested it and were able to taste it as a strawberry mute, please leave a comment since this would bring this concentrate even more to the top of the list of strawberry flavors.",

Smells really good and it's not disappointing. It wouldn't go a miss to add abit more sweetness to this I think it lacks it somewhat but not enough mark it down.  \n\nImagine what a blackberry can do with a recipe who doesn't like apple and blackberry pie or dark fruits in some bakery or cream dessert well pack some of these little dark berries into it. Again it's going to work in you're beverage recipes possibly making other berries more tart and the blackberry more sweet.  \n\nI think mixing at 3% is a little low but I'm getting enough out of it to take notes but bare this in mind when adding to recipes it could fade out into the background after a few weeks.

At 3% standalone, it really pushes more towards frosting than icing.  Reminiscent of a jar of Betty Crocker rich and creamy white frosting.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Alcohol note initially which steeps out eventually.  The cheese note may be off putting or sour to some people at higher percentages, although I feel it adds to what the flavor is supposed to be.\n\n**Throat hit:** 4/10, smooth and dense.\n\n**Uses:**  Great for adding mouthfeel and thickness to cream bases.  Also nice for adding a sweet icing/frosting top to your favorite bakeries.  May work with yogurt flavors to add a more authentic dairy note too.\n\n**Pairings:**  Creams, cakes, cookies, coffee, cereal, yogurt, preferred fruits.\n\n**Notes:**   This flavor may require a bit longer steep time to develop true potential and evaporate the alcohol out.

EM might be helpful to take away some of the harshness if you aren't using a cream.  Koolada works well if you're into the \"cold lemonade\" sensation.  Tea and Champagne flavors come to mind as well.\n\n**Notes:**   This concentrate is a bit weak at 3% and may require upping the percentage or pairing with another lemon flavoring to achieve a nice strong lemon taste in a mix.  In comparison to FLV Lemonade, it is close, but I personally get a bit more of a \"Country Time powdered mix\" sensation from FLV's version.\n\nEDIT: [Link to all of our flavor reviews in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)",

Seems to have some fading issues.\n\nThere is a pretty sizable hit of artificial banana in here.  It isn't particularly sharp or too aggressive, but it's right at the front of the flavor.  I'd say its more of a taffy type of banana because of that softness, instead of a hyper-saturated sugary banana runt.  The artificial part of the banana seems pretty similar to the kind of banana in LA Banana Cream.\n\nThere is something a bit more nuanced underneath.  I get some slightly underripe realistic banana notes.  Slightly green, but like actual banana green.  Not as underripe as FA Banana, but some of that same vibe.  It's definitely sitting in the back of the flavor and only shows up when that candy banana calms down a bit after steeping.\n\nThis flavor is relatively soft, and if you check the second opinions section, seems to have some fading issues on the steep.  After steeping, it's probably a bit more realistic, but it gets a bit subtle as that more intense candy banana starts to fade.  This has sort of creamy mouthfeel because of the softness, but it doesn't have any kind of actual dairy note to it.  Sweetness level isn't full on candy, maybe a step sweeter than actual banana but nothing crazy.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  More banana candy than actual banana.  Besides that, nothing chemical or unpleasant at tested percentages.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Nah.  Very smooth.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  Testing these liquid barn flavors, I just mixed a tester at the suggested percentage, then another sample at half that rounded up to the nearest full percentage if applicable.\n\nAt 4% I get a candy forward banana, but that more realistic banana is in there as an accent.  Flavor feels a bit on the thin side and kind of soft.\n\n7% isn't radically different, although that candy banana is coming through a bit clearer and that flavor is a bit less thin and more creamy.\n\nJust based on these tests, I'd probably be mixing this close to the suggested percentage of 7% and even then it's probably not going to be standing up to more aggressive flavors as a primary note in a mix.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This might be a bit of a challenge to mix with, the more realistic banana base here is probably going to get lost really easily in a mix and that candy banana seems to fade out.  I'd stay on the relatively simple side with it.\n\nSimilar kind of applications as LA Banana Cream, more useful for adding a banana taffy, or banana cream type of banana and then vaping relatively quickly.  I do think that LA Banana Cream has the edge here, but this isn't a bad alternative except for the fading issues.\n\nShould work fine as a background in fruit mixes, softer flavor to put up against acidic bright fruits like orange and pineapple.\n\nCandy here is mellow enough to work with cream bases as well.\n\nMakes a fairly convincing single flavor banana vape at 7% as a S&V.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Here's the ELR Page.  User \"jojo\" writes: \"4% (SnV - it’s no Ripe banana, but it’s not bad.

Shout out to Liquid Barn*\n\n**Setup:** Recoil w/ flavor barrel, Dual 15 wrap 26g 3mm Nifethal 70 coils @.17 ohms.  60w power, 450F temp limit. Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Liquid Barn Baked Cinnamon Roll, 3 and 5%  @ 1g/ml, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 30 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  This doesn't really feel like a full bakery by itself.  As odd as it sounds, this seems like mostly just the \"baked\" part of a baked cinnamon roll.\n\nI'm not getting too much actual roll here.  I'm getting some very warm, authentic baked sweet dough kind of top notes but without any of the doughy body underneath.  And it definitely tastes baked, or at least it tastes like a baking cinnamon roll smells.  Very light yeast-risen note, but I have no idea where the rest of the cinnamon roll is.\n\nThe cinnamon portion of this is really interesting.  There's some cinnamon spice here, but not an overwhelming bakery cinnamon flavor.  Again, this is doing a really accurate job of capturing the top notes from that cinnamon swirl in a cinnamon roll, but I'm not getting any of the depth or richness.  It mostly gives an impression of that cinnamon rather than the dead-on flavor.  There's almost the outline of some of the butter you'd expect in there, but it doesn't really translate to that kind of richness.\n\nThis is fairly sweet, even without much body.  The sweetness itself has a baked raisin character to it and is fairly accurate but really thin.  So this baked cinnamon roll definitely had some raisins in there.  The sweetness level could be conducive to some kind of icing, but it's sort of hard to tell without the body of it.  I'm also getting a little bit of dark bakery vanilla, but it's pretty well balanced and doesn't really stand out.\n\nSo my biggest issue here is going to the lack of actual body.  The top notes here are spooky accurate but they just don't have much to latch on.  There's some fluffy body, but there's very little flavor in there to fill it up.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  The flavor just seems to be missing anything beyond the top notes, but nothing really off. There's some raisins in here, which work but may not be what you're looking for.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light.  There's some definite warmth which can be a bit much, but the cinnamon itself is relatively easy-going.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 3%, this is all top notes.  Light bakery cinnamon, and the smell of fresh baked cinnamon rolls. Sweetness level isn't overwhelming, and the raisin note is fairly light.\n\nAt 5%, I'm still not getting much body here.  The cinnamon still isn't over the top but is a little more intense.  I'm not picking up too much breadiness. Starts to push toward an icing level of sweetness, and that raisin note is sticking out a bit more.\n\nLiquid Barn suggests mixing this at 5%, but I'm not sure that's really necessary, as it doesn't really pick up the body for a primary note. I'd be mixing with this between 2-3% and using it an accent.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I'm not really feeling this a solo flavor, but I think it should have some really interesting applications as a \"baked\" additive for profiles that involve cinnamon.  I could see using this a heavier, breadier cinnamon roll like FW Cinnamon Roll to really make it feel more freshly baked, basically turning the top notes way up.  The light raisin thing also makes me think of cinnamon raisin bread.  I could also see this working in stuff like coffee cakes or even apple pies or fruit cobblers to help sell that bakery warmth.\n\nOutside of a bakery enhancer, this is going to be really interesting as an accent for warmer tobacco vapes, especially if you're throwing some fruit in there.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Here's the ELR Page.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/32191)  User \"jojo\" writes: \" 6% ( SnV - not sure about this one.

Suggested Mix Percentage: 9%\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Steep Time:** 25 Days. I did try it at 1 week, but it shows a significant difference with the longer steep. Although good, it is worth waiting for, the flavor really deepens.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Aroma:** Pastry, cake, cream, cinnamon, icing.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Flavor Description:** This is a rich and full bodied danish pastry. Authentic flavor, buttery densely packed layers of pastry that is topped with heavy cream and drizzled with cinnamon sugar. Most prominant flavor up front is buttery pastry. I'm not getting a light and flakey mouth feel, more of a heavy cake. Next I notice the cream, it's very much like their vanilla ice cream. No egginess like a custard, yet is has that creamy slightly cooked pudding like consistency usually found in cream cheese danishes. It has the flavor of a light vanilla cream though. The cinnamon is a mild bakery cinnamon, fairly light, and comes through more on the exhale along with a hint of a slightly darker baking vanilla, more of a low note than the vanilla cream. Sweet cream butter and sugar are well balanced in with the cinnamon, very much like the streusel they refer to in their description. Moderately sweet overall, I'm also getting a sweet powdered sugar type icing finish. Every once in a while I get a hint of a super light maple. It's very faint and seems to come and go. I'm wondering if there is some brown sugar in with the cinnamon?\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:** Faint maple every once in a while, nothing offensive.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit:** 2/10\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Pairings:** Almost any fleshy fruit would be good here, turning it into a fruit and cream danish. It will also fit in very well to strengthen bakery notes, especially in cinnamon rolls or anywhere you would normally use Capella Cinnamon Danish Swirl. Great to add sweetness and body to custards, and tobaccos. Also would be very good with nuts, specifically almonds and pecans.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Notes:** This is a very complex flavor, and makes an excellent single flavor for a fast and easy mix, or to have something good to vape while still learning about mixing. I enjoyed it at the recommended 9%, I wouldn't go over 10 tops. I'm going to start around 1-5% as an accent. It's much more complex than Capella's Cinnamon Danish, and I can see using this a lot.",

I get some light, pale yellow kind of eggo perfume out of it, but I'm missing almost all the body that I'd expect. There's a bit of volume to the waffle but not a whole lot of waffle flavor to fill it out.  What I do get is a little bready but not really crunchy.  More of a thawed eggo than toasted.\n\nThere's a little bit of buttery richness here, but it's doing the same thing a lot of the richer liquid barn flavors do for me and gives a richer mouthfeel than actual flavor. [The data sheet for this](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0307/9897/files/BelgianWaffle_DS.jpg?5513177427726715981) reports 1,100 ppm acetyl propionyl so I'm guessing it should taste a lot more buttery than does.  The butter I do get works pretty well, but overall this feels like it should taste a lot richer than it does.\n\nLiquid barn calls this \"drenched\" in syrup.  I wouldn't go that far.  You've got some plastic bottle grade maple syrup going on.  More just sweet than overwhelmingly maple. Overall, there isn't a ton of it, but it works pretty well with that eggoish vibe and light butter.\n\nI am picking up some weird off-flavors though.  At the suggested 8% I'm picking up something that tastes a little anise-ish. With the sweeter syrup it's almost like some one made a waffle with good and plenties instead of chocolate chips.  Not as prominent at 4%, but still present. Kind of like the weird anise note in CAP Yellow Cake or FA Nonna's Cake.  It could maybe an attempt at vanilla? There's also something that feels a lot like cinnamon in here. Not super prominent but distracting.\n\nWhile this has a lot of the flavors from the profile, it just doesn't work for me in texture.  I'm just getting a weird, lukewarm, light waffle with light butter and some watery syrup.  I'm not getting anything too crispy or even all the bready.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  I get a good deal of anise out of this, especially at 8%.  I also get some errant cinnamon occasionally.  Texture is thin and the syrup feels a bit watery.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Moderate? The base of the flavor feels a bit harsh, and then that cinnamon kicks up some throat hit as well.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 4% I'm not getting much out of this.  Kind of buttery on the lips, and some maple/anise syrup and cinnamon spice.  I'm not picking much waffle at all.\n\nAt 8% I'm getting a bit more waffle, but I definitely still want more. That anise note is also showing up quite a bit more for me here. Maple isn't overwhelming, and this has a bit more butter, but still feels a bit thin overall.\n\nLiquid barn suggests mixing this at 8%, although that anise thing is pretty distracting for me there.  I'd probably be closer to 5-6% trying to avoid the worst of it.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I think if you were using this you'd have to bump up the butter, and the waffle, and probably the maple.  For an eggo-ish flavor I like Capella a bit more, and for something more continental, you've got other options.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nNoted did an episode on waffles and pancakes and this was one of the included flavors. [Talk about this flavor starts about 19 minutes in.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMOFjJMTMYo&t=19m7s) CheebaSteeba likes it, but other reactions were a little more lukewarm.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Liquid Barn Blue Raspberry, 4 and 8%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 19 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  I came not to reopen the great blue raspberry wars, but to say this is a pretty solid candy blue raspberry.\n\nThere is quite a bit of heavy candy raspberry in here, but it's fairly well done. I get some initial almost lemony tartness which fades out pretty quickly to a heavily sweet duller raspberry body. It's a very warm and dense kind of candy raspberry.\n\nIt also tastes vaguely blue, which is interesting.  It has a bit of tarter blueberryish sweetness on top of that heavier raspberry and almost a bit of a yellow peach in the top notes.  There's also a sort of artificial edge on the top end of the flavor that really does taste like that lightly bitter, chemical heavily dyed thing going on with blue raspberry.\n\nThe sweetness and mouthfeel here bolsters the hard candy effect.  This is a fairly vibrant, but still syrupy and a bit watery all at the same time.  It sort of apes that mouthwatering thing that hard candy does.  The sweetness level and the character of the sweetness is definitely hard candy.\n\nThere's an entire rabbit hole of people chasing the perfect blue raspberry, but I don't have the widest basis of comparison.  I can unequivocally say this blows FW Blue Raspberry clean out of the water.  This is sweeter and more candied while still having a more nuanced raspberry and a more identifiable \"blue\" to it.  I'd say it punches up there with OSDIY Blue Raspberry Slush.  It's not quite as \"blue\" and i get more raspberry out of the liquid barn, but it doesn't have any of that enigmatic \"slush\" quality of the OSDIY and so it may end up being a bit more versatile... and you can buy it from bull city without having to make a special order.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  The LB fruit flavors I've tried so far taste a bit waxy and warm, and this is no exception.  It sort of works for it though.  That jolly rancher/blow-pop sweetness and texture works with it.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light.  That candy sweetness is a little warm and harsh, but nothing untoward.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 4% this feels a bit too thin for that candy profile.  While I get some decent flavor saturation on the beginning of the exhale, it thins out substantially and doesn't quite have that heavy hard candy body and sweetness.\n\nAt 8% this is quite a bit fuller and warmer.  The actual blue raspberry here is a bit more vibrant than at 4%, but the body is much heavier and sweeter and does the hard candy thing pretty well.\n\nJust based on these tests, I'd probably be mixing this as a primary flavor right around that Liquid Barn suggested 8%.  I think you could comfortably bump it to 10% if you really want to hammer the blue raspberry in as a solo.  I'm not really sure a light blue raspberry accent is a thing.\n\nAlso worth noting this is one of Liquid Barn's \"VG dominant\" flavors, at 67% VG.  My percentages here are using the standard specific gravity of 1 g/ml thing because only savages mix by volume and I didn't try to do the math to adjust my mixing by weight.  But they do give a specific gravity of 1.23 g/ml if you're into that sort of thing.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  There's always going to be some room for improvement, but it's a pretty solid solo flavor at high percentages.  You could probably just add some sucralose and get close to a blue raspberry jolly rancher without having to mess around with something else to get that candy texture.\n\nIf you wanted to get crazy, you could probably bolster this with some TPA Sweet Raspberry or FLV Raspberry to punch up the berry here a bit.  Basically use any of the tricks that apexified used with OSDIY Blue Raspberry slush in either his [\"Blue Frost\"](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/9179#blue_frost_by_apexified) or [\"Blue Frost Revisited\"](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/54784#blue_frost_revisited_by_apexified) recipes.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Here's the ELR Page.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/42887)  User \"jojo\" writes: \"5% (SnV - little weak, but definitely a blue raspberry vibe. 10 days - still weak. 2 weeks - still a little week, but definitely blue raspberry. 5 weeks - pretty good.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Liquid Barn Cappuccino, 5 and 10%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 22 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  A sweeter, creamy coffee flavor with a hit of chocolate.  I wouldn't call it cappuccino so much as a mocha, but it's pretty solid overall.\n\nFWIW, I've been accused of tasting coffee flavors as chocolately, so take all of this with a grain of salt I guess.  To be fair, I don't seem like the only person with that issue if you check the second opinions, especially the reviews on the liquid barn product page.\n\nI'm not getting a really intense flavor from the coffee here.  This is coming across as a bit lighter and less concentrated, more in the background of the mix like it would be in a latte rather than more up front like a cappuccino.  I wouldn't call it a strong coffee per se, but there are some darker roasted notes.  I'm not picking up anything like the burnt popcorn you get from a lot of really intense coffee or espresso flavors, so that's definitely a plus.\n\nI'm picking up a some noticeable chocolate overtones here.  Feels a lot like a chocolate syrup for a mocha.  It's not overwhelming and doesn't have too much in the way of a waxy body here, working more as an accent overall.  Pretty middle-of-the road kind of milk chocolate flavor without any really heavy dark cocoa.  Well balanced with everything else, but more mocha than cappuccino.\n\nThere's a fluffy cream component here as well.  It's a sweeter cream, without any really heavy dairy notes.  With the fluffier texture and sweetness, seems a bit more like a whipped topping than richer whipped cream.  Softens up that coffee and chocolate fairly nicely though, and the texture carries through really well.\n\nThis feels pretty intensely sweet for me.  It tastes like there is already some kind of sweetener in there.  It's probably pushing a moderately tasteful level of commercial juice sweet at 10%, but It stops short of being profoundly oversweet.  This is a fairly dark flavor with that coffee and chocolate, but it hasn't been too bad on the coils.  I'm not getting too much coil gore about 15ml in, although I do notice my wicks getting a bit crunchy and the flavor has gotten just a bit flat.  Not awful for the profile though.  I will say the coffee starts to taste a bit darker as those wicks darken up.  So it's a feature, and not a bug?\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Balance seems off from a cappuccino and I wasn't really expecting as much chocolate as I'm getting here, but none of the components are in any way unpleasant or chemical.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Definitely on the light side.  Pretty smooth overall.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  5% feels a whole lot like a lighter version of the suggested 10%. I'm getting less chocolate, very little coffee, and less texture and sweetness to the cream.  Feels a bit thin here.\n\nAt 10%, this basically just feels like a sweeter but well balanced mocha vape.  I get some coffee base, chocolate top notes, and a fluffier cream body.\n\nJust based on these tests, Liquid Barn's suggestion 0f 10% seems pretty dead on.  I'd be using this as a primary flavor, and I can't think of anything else strong I'd want with it to bump it down to an accent percentage.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This is probably going to work best as a solo flavor.  I'd guess that at least 75% of people looking for a coffee flavor actually want something sweeter and creamier like this and wouldn't mind that chocolate.\n\nYou could probably add a tiny tiny bit of FA UP to boost the coffee in here, but I'd probably stay away from the more burnt straight espresso flavors.\n\nI'm getting a lot of cream in here already, but it would probably go well with a vanilla cream flavor if you find it lacking.

Shoutout to Liquid Barn*\n\n**Setup:** Recoil w/ flavor barrel, Dual 15 wrap 26g 3mm Nifethal 70 coils @.14 ohms.  60w power, 450F temp limit. Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Liquid Barn Cherry Blossom Tea, 3 and 6%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 20 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Fairly solid cherry blossom with a tea accent.\n\nI feel like the cherry blossom is firmly in the drivers seat on this flavor. If you check the second opinions, I may be in the minority, but I get very recognizable and saturated cherry blossom right up front.  Pretty standard cherry blossom.  There is a floral component to the cherry blossom, but it feels fuller and more fleshed out than a chalky, bitter perfume that you get off really intense florals.  Overall, it's a really full take on a cherry blossom that works well.\n\nThe tea seems more like an accent.  I do get some light earthiness, but I'm not sure I'd pick it out if the label didn't say \"Cherry Blossom Tea.\" Theres more a black tea warmth to the flavor rather than a heavy tea leaf flavor.  I'm not picking up anything grassy like green tea, and with the relative subtlety of the tea note I'd almost call it a white tea.  There's also a lightly tannic astringency here that does the tea thing pretty convincingly.\n\nThis feels like a warm tea flavor.  I'm picking up some of that waxy texture that I've got from some of the other liquid barn flavors, but it feels like a fit for the profile and the flavor here is full enough to carry it.  Sweetness level seems pretty dead on, present enough to support that fruitier cherry blossom without being too overbearing or cloying.\n\nThe Cherry Blossom here is really similar to TPA Cherry Blossom.  Same kind of floral cherry note, with the same lighter version of normal cherry off notes.  The tea accent here actually pulls the liquid barn version a bit further afield from a straight floral and adds some earthiness for contrast making the entire thing seem a bit more balanced.  I feel like the biggest difference here is going to be in mouthfeel.  TPA Cherry Blossom leans toward chalky and powdery and this is a bit thicker and more waxy than dry.  I'm not sure this is essential if you've already got TPA Cherry Blossom, but it's different enough to be worth picking up if you're super into the profile and want a fuller version of the same type of flavor.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Standard for cherry blossom, it does have a (relatively light compared to normal cherries, for sure) bit of off-gassing plastic cherry off note thing.  Not in the same ballpark as the worst cherry flavors, but it's there if it bothers you. A bit waxy and warm, but it seems to be working fairly well the profile.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Moderate.  I do get some harshness out of this but it sort of contributes the tea vibe.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  The composition of this seems just a bit more skewed towards tea at 3%.  I'd still call it cherry blossom forward, but the tea is coming through a bit clearer with less of that cherry blossom going on. I'm getting less cherry than 6% but the actual flavor seems fairly similar and I'm still getting the same light off notes.\n\nAt 6% the cherry blossom here is a bit bolder and sweeter and moves forward a bit more in the mix.  I am getting a bit more weirdness off the cherry but it's reasonably.  Tea feels more like an additive at this percentage.  Also noticeably sweeter here.\n\nJust based on these tests, I'd probably be around 5% with this as a solo or primary flavor.  As an accent or just part of a base you could probably drop that around 2-3%.  Liquid Barn suggests 6%, so their percentages are seeming fairly solid so far.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I'm pretty sure you're locked into tea profiles with this.  While I don't find the tea to be too overbearing, it does show up enough to lock you into that kind of profile.  Personally, I could stand a heavier tea in here so I'd look at FA Black Tea or FLV Lemon Tea for some added citrus as well.  I don't this tastes too dark to work with green teas if that's more your thing.\n\nIn terms of accents, I can't think of too much beyond lemon or maybe a lighter touch with a realistic-ish raspberry like FA Raspberry or FLV Red Raspberry.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Here's the ELR Page.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/42488)  User \"jojo\" writes: \"6% (SnV - a little strong, kinda dirt tasting. 10 days - still pretty earthy, I think from the cherry, but kinda tasty. 2 weeks - interesting, not sure. 3 weeks - better.

It's the familiar sort of dry bordering on chemical kind of chocolate note from tootsie rolls.  I maybe get something just a bit darker than actual tootsie rolls, but it feels like the same kind of chocolate.  It's more semi-sweet cocoa powder in sugar, rather than an actual chocolate with any kind of rich base underneath it.\n\nThere's some volume here, but it's waxy instead of really creamy.  It's sort of a fluffy, whipped cream mouthfeel without any of dairy notes and with the chocolate is sort of just sitting on top.  Liquid barn calls it \"taffy-like\" and it's pretty much a fit for the whole tootsie roll thing.\n\nOverall this is a whole lot like TPA Double Chocolate Clear, but a bit waxier and darker.  It also has a weird boozy finish to it.  Not really a chocolate liqueur, so much as chocolate than liquor.  There's something sharp and lightly chemical on the back end of this with quite a bit of bite.  There's a decent sweetness at the front of the flavor, but that weirder backend kicks in and the entire thing seems a bit dry on the finish.\n\nThis is a darker concentrate, and as a chocolate, it's doing pretty much what you'd expect to the coils and cotton.  It's not FA Cocoa bad, but it's definitely leading to a bit of coil gunking and my wicks are fairly crispy and the flavor muted after around 5ml dripped.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  After 42 days, I'm still getting something boozy and sharp in the background of this.  Also, definitely a tootsie roll chocolate, which is a fit for the profile but maybe not what most people just seeing the \"chocolate\" here would be looking for.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light to moderate.  This actually feels a bit harsh to me, especially at the back end of the flavor.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 5% this tastes like a slightly boozy and waxy TPA Double Chocolate Clear.  Off flavors are present, but not completely overwhelming.  Definitely gets the tootsie roll thing across though.\n\nAt 9% this is pretty overwhelming.  Denser mouthfeel, slightly richer chocolate with some darker cocoa depth, but that booziness is pretty prominent for me.\n\nLiquid Barn suggests 9%.  I'm not really digging it that high.  Just based on these tests, I'd probably be around 3-4% trying to avoid that weird booziness and forgoing the majority of that \"roll\"-ish body.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Use should be pretty comparable to TPA or CAP Double Chocolate.  You'll have to add creams and AP to get anywhere close to a chocolate bar.  The booziness here doesn't seem like it will really go well with the more chocolate syrup applications you can use TPA and CAP for.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Here's the ELR Page.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/41590)  User \"jojo\" writes: \"5% (SnV - Kind of a chalky taste.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Liquid Barn Coconut Milk, 4 and 7% @ 1g/ml, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 25 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  A heavy, waxy coconut cream, with an errant spiciness.\n\nThe coconut here skirts the line between coconut cream and the coconut from a pina colada mix.  While I do get some smoother, more realistic coconut in here, there's something that feels a lot like artificial coconut backing it up.  It's not an overwhelming suntan lotion vibe, but it definitely has some of that heavy fake coconut going on.\n\nFor the most part, the texture here is pretty great.  It's intensely thick and creamy.  It's not as full-on buttery as FLV Coconut, but it's thicker and richer than a lot of other coconut flavors.  Some of the second opinions mention this feeling a bit oily, and I can totally see it.  There is a waxiness here that combines with the richer coconut cream, and it can definitely come across as a scoop of hydrogenated coconut oil.  This is also substantially sweeter than straight coconut milk, it's not unpleasant but it sort of bumps the artificial factor.\n\nI'm also getting something spicy out this, and I'm going back on forth on whether it's a sort of cinnamon note or just some of the ethyl alcohol not completely having calmed down.  My testers here are 3.5 weeks deep into steeping, so if it's the ethyl alcohol thing then it's definitely persistent.  Comparing this to a freshly mixed sample, that spicy note is a little less pronounced after a relatively long steep, but it still feels too prominent to just be a steeping issue.  The spice shows up mostly in the top notes and as the inhale builds.  Sort of feels more like cinnamon rather than having a distinct cinnamon taste to it.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  That spiciness (or raw ethyl alcohol nearly a month out, i guess) sticks out quite a bit against the coconut milk.  Overall texture is heavier and waxier than actual coconut milk, and the flavor skews a bit artificial.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  From that coconut milk part, not really.  That part is very smooth.  That spicy bite is moderately harsh though, especially at higher percentages.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 4%, this actually feel fairly full.  It's still a bit on the waxy side, but it isn't as intensely heavy and creamy and the coconut feels a bit brighter.  It does taste a little artificial here, but that weird spiciness is fairly subtle.\n\nAt 7% this is quite a bit heavier.  The coconut doesn't feel too much pronounced than 7%, but the cream around it feels thicker, richer, and oily.  I'm also picking up more of that spicy bite.\n\nJust based on these tests, I'd probably be using this an accent flavor to back up more neutral creams at around 2-3%.  Liquid barn suggests mixing at 7% but it's almost too assertive for me up that high, and that coconut oil thing is distracting.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This doesn't really work all that well as a single flavor.  Without something else going here that weird spice and wax thing is fairly distracting from the creamier coconut base going on here.  Unlike most of the liquid barn stuff I've tested so far, this definitely feels more like a component for more complex mixes.\n\nI'd primarily be using this as a coconut cream enhancer.  Should work well at small percentages to thicken up custards and creams without absolutely dominating them with a coconut flavor.\n\nThis should also work well behind brighter tropical fruits like mango and pineapple.  Might be a good jumping off point for a coconut cream for a pina colada.\n\nIf that spiciness isn't just ethyl alcohol, this would also work well in horchata type recipes.\n\nBecause of that waxiness, I think this would be a good base for a coconut frosting along with INW Shisha Vanilla, FLV Frosting, or CAP Vanilla Cupcake.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Here's the ELR Page.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/40353)  User \"jojo\" writes: \" 4% (SnV - a decent coconut, a little plastic. 1 week - Little sunscreen but mostly creamy coconut flavor.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Liquid Barn Cola Freeze, 4 and 8%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 21 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Cola syrup, light on the freeze.\n\nThis tastes a whole lot more like a cola syrup than a your typical can of coke.  The spice top notes are duller and I'm not getting much in way of spicy dark vanilla.  If you put a gun to my head, this seems to have a bit more a citric bite up so I'd probably lean more pepsi type, but there isn't a whole lot of nuance to go off.  The sharpness here seems fairly limited to the inhale, and the exhale is a lot flatter and sweeter.  Nice flavor saturation of that heavier cola syrup though, even if it is a bit dull.\n\nFor something with freeze in the name, I really don't get a strong cooling note.  This is much more sticky and warm than frosty.  It seems like there may be a really really light cooling that shows up as the inhale builds and at the very tail end of the flavor, but it's extremely light and could just be the heaviness of that flavor tailing off a bit.\n\nThis feels a whole lot like cola syrup as well.  There's a pretty intense sticky sweetness in here. That normal waxiness of the liquid barn flavors is doing a good job selling some of that HFCS filmy mouthfeel. This is sticky and heavy enough that I'm not really feeling the slush part of this or anything resembling carbonation.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Not really.  I feel like a broken record here but these are fairly \"warm\" flavors and they have a waxy mouthfeel.  Both of those attributes work to sell the cola syrup thing.  There's also no real cooling, so that's probably an off flavor for something called \"Cola Freeze.\"\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light.  A bit citric and bright right at the front of the flavor, but pretty mellow after that.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 4% this pretty much just tastes like a thinner and less sweet version of the 8%.  Doesn't so much feel like cola syrup as the melted cola ice.\n\nAt 8% this is quite a bit more syrupy.  More saturated flavor and sweeter.  Definitely feels like a more full flavor over all.\n\nLiquid barn suggests 8% with this, and that's probably close to the mark for full flavor here.  I don't think would add much using at a lower accent percentage.\n\nFWIW, we've got another VG dominant flavor here with a specific gravity of 1.21 g/ml.  I'm lazy and mix by weight, so my percentages are based on the more standard 1 g/ml measurement.  So the suggested flavor by volume would more like 10% if you're using 1 g/ml.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This should get along really well with FA Cola, which has pretty awesome cola top notes but struggles a bit on body.  Combining the two should net you a very sweet, but still vibrant cola vape.  This is mellow enough you could probably swap in some FW or FLV Root Beer for the top notes and use the cola freeze for a syrupy body.\n\nThis is also fairly syrupy and a bit of ws-23 would probably get you to an actual cola freeze.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[This flavor was featured on the slush episode of Noted at around the 52 minute mark.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGzmA2zfXMY#t=52m13s\n)  Your hero and mine, CheebaSteeba covers it pretty succintly.

This doesn't have any heavy dairy notes like TPA/CAP Sweet Cream or FA Fresh Cream.  I do get something buttery here, kind of like a heavy whipped cream but the top end of the flavor is really thin and neutral.  I'm not picking up any kind of vanilla in here, or anything that tastes too butryic or cheesy.\n\nThe mouthfeel on this is interesting.  I'm picking up some sort of waxy buttery heaviness on my lips and tongue but it doesn't actually taste particularly rich.  [Liquid Barn has their DAAP testing public and easily readable](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0307/9897/files/Cream_DS.jpg?5513177427726715981) and this has a truly impressive amount of acetoin in here with 3,680 ppm.  Just as a basis for comparison FLV Coconut, which is rich to a fault basically, is up at 2,800ppm... so Liquid Barn didn't hold back on the DAAP here. I'm not sure why the actual vape here isn't a whole lot richer and more buttery.  Instead, beyond that sort of tactile mouthfeel, it feels a bit washed out and not particularly rich and creamy.  It's lacking of a lot of the body you'd expect for a fluffier whipped cream.\n\nI think the primary issue is flavor saturation.  There's a sweetness here that is either raw vg or tastes almost exactly like raw vg, and it comes through even at the suggested 6%.  The actual cream just doesn't feel filled out.  I'm getting some of the deeper richer notes I'd expect, but the middle and the top of the flavor is a bit bland and has that weird sweetness that doesn't really fit in with the cream.\n\nComparing this to other whipped cream type flavors I've tried, I'm probably sticking with CAP Vanilla Whipped Cream or FW Sweet Cream.  Both of those are a bit more buttery and have a fluffier mouthfeel.  The flavor in those also feels quite a bit more saturated.  There's nothing offensive in the liquid barn version, but it isn't really as rich as either of those.  This also doesn't have the crazy smooth emulsifying texture of FLV Cream.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Nothing really off in terms of flavor.  Texture and mouthfeel feels a bit weird though and I'm getting raw vg sweetness in the top of the flavor.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  The base of this flavor is very smooth, but overall that thinner top end is lightly harsh.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 3% this feels really underflavored.  I'm getting quite a bit of raw vg taste of it with a lighter and sort of dry cream taste.  Sort of tastes like coffee creamer in VG here.\n\nAt 6% this is a bit more filled out.  It's still probably a bit too subtle, and the sweetness here really does taste like raw vg which is a bit confusing.  Bottom end of the flavor is full but it hasn't really carried over to the top of the flavor.\n\nJust based on these tests, I think the suggested percentage of 6% is probably a good starting point with the caveat that it's going to be a base for layering and not really a full cream flavor.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This may actually end up being a fairly good cream for layering because the top end of this is flavor is so netural.  I could see adding this as a base for brighter fruits and letting those fill in the top of the flavor.\n\nI'm not sure this is going to work all that well in bakery applications. All of that low end is where a lot of bakery flavors sit, and so it may just muddy up your bases as opposed to sit on top.\n\nYou could probably use an accent percentage to fill in more dairy-forward creams.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Here's the ELR Page.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/43322)  User \"jojo\" writes: \"4% (SnV - a nice, slightly sweet cream. 10 days - not getting much now but a vague, slightly sweet creamy feel. 3 weeks - this is a nice, light cream.

There's a heavy eggy note in here.  Some dairy in here behind that egg, but it seems more heavily balanced towards the egg than anything too buttery or creamy.  Maybe a really light bakery vanilla, but not all that prominent.  Overall though, recognizably a custard.\n\nThe brulee here sort of straddles the line between caramel sauce and an actual brulee.  It's kind of medium-dark caramel taste but it seems to have some of the cardboardy issues you get with softer caramel flavors, although not nearly as bad as those can get in a flavor like CAP Caramel.  Quite a bit of caramel sweetness in here.  Doesn't quite have that really hard caramel crunchiness you'd expect from a creme brulee, but it's still working pretty well.\n\nThe caramel here dries this out substantially.  I'm not getting much in the way of separation between the caramel and custard, so while you can definitely taste the brulee component, it doesn't really feel like a creme brulee.  The dryness and the heavy caramel note almost remind of a heavy butterscotch custard.  The overall mouthfeel is decently rich, but that dryness starts to be a bit much, at least solo.  This feels like it has some kind of sweetener in here. It works well on fresh cotton but tends to make your wicks and a bit crunchy and the flavor starts to get a bit muddy and dry with extended vaping.  Not catastrophic or anything, just watch out for adding sweetener.\n\nComparing this some of the creme brulee flavors, this works quite a bit better as a full creme brulee than FLV Brulee.  The caramel in FLV Brulee is a bit darker but it has a bit of more of a cardboard edge to it, and it's firmly in the bring your own custard territory.  INW Creme Brulee is still probably a better creme brulee though.  The custard in INW Creme Brulee feels like it has a richer base to it with a bit better balance between the eggs and dairy, and the caramelized sugar note there feels a bit more crisp and has more of a separation with the custard base.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Caramel is tricky, but this does fairly well with limiting some of that weird cardboard note they can pick up.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light to moderate, the dryness here can get a bit harsh, especially with a bit more heat.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 6% this doesn't seem to really be clicking as a creme brulee flavor. I'm getting mostly soft caramel with a bit of richer eggy notes in the background. Overall the flavor doesn't have much definition and kind of just feels like a caramel sauce.\n\nAt 11% the custard component here is more pronounced.  Clear eggy custard flavor with a pretty intense and medium dark dry caramel.  Feels like most of the component of a brulee are there but feel a bit jumbled up and the texture isn't quite working for me.  Also heavily sweet.\n\nLiquid barn suggests mixing this at 11% and it seems just a bit aggressive for me.  Just based on these tests, I'd probably be around 4% of this as an accent or 8% as a primary flavor.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  The caramel here is pretty aggressive, and this could be used a caramel accent flavor with other cream bases.  It's not quite rich enough to be a butterscotch, but it should have some of that same affect.  This is less aggressively cardboardy than CAP Caramel and a whole lot less murderous on wicks than FW or TPA Caramel Candy, so it may be pretty useful.\n\nAs a primary flavor, I'm thinking it needs a softer custard flavor to sort of flesh out the base a bit and move it away from that drier caramel note.  A relatively low percentage of INW Custard or CAP Vanilla Custard would probably work without steamrolling that caramel.\n\nNot a bad creme brulee base if you wanted to add in some strawberries or something similar and give another element to focus on here so the texture thing isn't as distracting.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Here's the ELR Page.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/39190)  User \"jojo\" writes: \"8% (SnV - what I’d imagine creme brûlée would taste like.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Liquid Barn Dew Mountain, 5 and 9%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 17 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  A softer mountain dew flavor, with a duller waxy orange and less bright citrus than you'd expect.\n\nThis sort of tastes like drinking the melted ice left over in a fountain mountain dew.  While it has a lot of the flavors you'd expect, it's all too soft and a bit watery.  Out of the citrus mix, I'm mostly getting a light, sort of waxy orange flavor.  The wax is a little weird and I'm not quite getting from the vibrancy I'd expect from the profile.\n\nThere's also some sharper lemon and lime accents here.  I get more lime than lemon, which sort of fits for whatever mountain dew is supposed to taste like.  While there is an initial tart burst from the lime, it doesn't really have the body to carry that part of the flavor and feels softer and muted.\n\nSweetness level is probably a fit for a soda profile.  Not really that delicious velvety kind of HFCS feel, but that's mostly on the mouthfeel.  The top notes here are sort of dry while at the the same time the base is a bit on the watery and thin side.  Doesn't feel especially soda-esque and I'm not getting anything that feels like carbonation out of this.\n\nYou also taste a bit of a metallic flavor, like you could get from drinking soda out of a warm can.  It's sort of mineral tang on the actual vape, but the lingering taste is strangely metallic.\n\n[This also proved wholly inadequate at dissolving mouse carcasses.](https://www.snopes.com/medical/potables/mountaindewmouse.asp)\n\n**Off-flavors:**  The orange flavor here has a warm waxiness that doesn't seem like a fit for a beverage profile.  Metallic tang in here as well.  Beyond that, nothing that tastes particularly off or chemical, but it doesn't quite have the vibrancy of a mountain dew flavor.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Moderate. Not especially harsh, but it's still a citrus.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 5%  this feels fairly watery.  I'm getting some brighter lime accents but the orange body is really thin and undersweet.\n\nAt 9% this still feels a bit on the watery side. More of that orange is coming through, but it's more waxy than juicy.  Lime is fairly clear and I'm getting some more subtle lemon in there as well.\n\nJust based on these tests, I'd be around Liquid Barn's suggested 9% on this.  This is a bit too soft to really work well as an accent flavor, I think you pretty much have to use it as a primary.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Mountain dew is such a weird flavor that I don't quite know how to sort of bolster and fill this out without taking it away from classic mountain dew.  I'd say maybe a bit of a mandarin-ish flavor without wax like FA Blood Orange or FW Tangerine could help.  You could probably boost the lime and some of the sparkling soda effect with some FA Lime Distilled.  You could also try filling it out with your lemonade of choice.\n\nBeyond that, you may be able to take this into a more orange heavy direction for something like Livewire, or some candy grape for pitch black.  I'd skip the cherry thing entirely.  A non-terrible code red is probably an impossible dream at this point. My knowledge of specialty mountain dew flavors is pretty limited after that.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Here's the ELR Page.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/14362)  User \"jojo\" writes: \"8% SnV - can’t put my finger on this.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Liquid Barn Fresh Cream, 4 and 7%  @ 1g/ml, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 27 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  A cream base with a thinner top end.\n\nThe cream here tastes closer to a whipped cream than a fresh cream.  I'm not picking up any heavy realistic dairy notes.  It tastes a bit more light and buttery than fresh cream.  I am getting a hit of coconut out of this, similar to the coconut in TPA Cheesecake (Graham Crust).  It's not overwhelming or anything, but it definitely shows up as a solo flavor.  No vanilla or butryic cheesy notes though.\n\nI'm running into a lot of the same issues with this as I was with the normal [Liquid Barn Cream](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/7awr75/lb_cream/).  There's a decent, fairly rich base here with quite a bit of actual tactile richness all up in your mouth, but there's really no mid or top notes here.  And again, like the cream, I'm not willing to chalk it up to a lack of DAAP.  [On the datasheet for Fresh Cream] Liquid Barn states this 1,000ppm of Acetyl Propionyl... and while I'm by no means an expert that does definitely seem like it's enough to party.  That richer base doesn't really translate to a full, rich vape.  I'm still picking up a little bit of a weird raw vg sweetness to this up at the suggested 7%.  The texture on the top of the flavor is kind of thin and dry, even while you're getting that richer bottom end.  It's odd.  Also, it's a distinctly pink concentrate, which isn't a bad thing, but it's kind of interesting.\n\nComparing this to other fresh cream type flavors, this simultaneously feels a bit richer on the bottom end, but thinner everywhere else.  This also doesn't have much in the way of actual dairy notes compared to FA Fresh Cream or TPA/CAP sweet cream.  This also doesn't really have the body of any of the whipped cream flavors.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  A little bit of coconut here, but that's shouldn't really stick out when mixed. I taste raw vg sweetness in the top of the flavor.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  That thin and dry end is actually a little harsh.  Base is crazy smooth, but it dries out as the vape goes on.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 4% this is really thin at the top.  Some richer, buttery base but there just doesn't feel like there is much flavor and I'm just tasting my base on top of that.\n\nAt 7%, this is maybe a bit better, but I'm running into the same kind of issues.  The base is definitely present, but the top end is still relatively thin.  I'm getting more of a coconut vibe here as well.\n\nLiquid barn suggests mixing this at 7%, and that's probably okay with the caveat that it's more of a base for layering than a full flavor.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**   Pretty much the same as the normal LB Cream.  The thin top end of this means you're pretty much going to be using this as a base for brighter fruits and maybe some drier bakeries.  Would also work to add some DAAP hit to the bottom end of another milk or cream flavor.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Here's the ELR Page.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/67293)  User \"jojo\" writes: \"6% (SnV - Definitely a creamy mouthfeel, tiny bit sweet, slight coconut flavor. 1 week - same.

There's some slightly fluffy whipped cream type mouthfeel to it.  I'm not picking up anything in the way of non-yogurt dairy notes.  I'm mostly getting a pretty heavy chalky sweetness with a surprisingly neutral flavor up front.  It's almost like a boosted, chalky version of VG sweetness.  Liquid barn calls out a \"toasted vanilla\", and maybe get a bit of a vanilla ice cream type of vanilla in the top notes.  It tastes almost a bit malty, but it's pretty subtle overall.\n\nThere also doesn't feel like there is much I'd associate with a normal \"yogurt\" flavor here.  On the backend of the flavor I do get some of that funkier yogurt tang, but it's pretty light.  Nothing too overtly butryic or cheesy, just more of a slight tartness and some pretty standard almost spoiled dairy.  This feels about as aggressive as something like a go-gurt or kid's yogurt, without any of the real heavy sour dairy notes from more intense yogurt concentrates.  It actually seems to take a couple drags to really get that yogurt to come out, it's pretty well hidden in there.\n\nSeems pretty sweet overall.  Mouthfeel is interesting, you've got some drier chalky notes and something feels a bit watery at the front of the flavor where you've got texture but not a lot of actual flavor.  No really heavy, sugar lips kind of sucralose sweetness though.\n\nJust on a purely subjective note, I've never really \"got\" yogurt concentrates.  Hot yogurt and all that.  So in comparing this to other available yogurts it's kind of a good news / bad news situation.  The good news is that it's the least offensive yogurt flavor I've tried in terms of that hot cheesy yogurt thing.  The bad news is that it's definitely the least yogurt-ish out of at least CAP Creamy Yogurt, FLV Greek Yogurt, and the new FA Yogurt.  All of those other concentrates are identifiably yogurt, which this kind of struggles with.  They are all quiet a bit more butyric than this, but they also handle the creamy, richer parts of yogurt a bit better (granted FA Yogurt needs about 3 months to do it.)\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Pretty chalky overall, and the flavor feels a bit thin.  Not much yogurt.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light to moderate.  That chalkiness gets a bit dry and harsh.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 5% this is lightly tart, chalky and sweet.  I'm not getting much yogurt at all, and I'm also not picking up any vanilla here.\n\nAt 10% this is maybe a bit more chalky, slightly sweeter, and just a bit more tart.  The yogurt is starting to come out more on the backend, but it's still pretty light.  Vanilla is starting to show up.\n\nLiquid barn suggests mixing with this at 10%.  Seems to need that kind of higher percentage to get much yogurt out of this.  Seems like a solid enough jumping off point.  Doesn't seem to be a bold enough flavor to really work as a lighter accent.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I'm not sure there are any really clear cut situations where this is going to be the best yogurt option available.  It isn't bold enough to really work as an aggressive kind of yogurt, and it isn't creamy enough to work as a mellow yogurt background, although it could work that way with a different cream in the mix.\n\nIf you are using this, maybe throw some fruit and some more cream at it?  You could also mix it with some ice cream and a bit of cooling for a frozen yogurt mix.  The lack of heavy butryic notes should work relatively well with cooling.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Here's the ELR Page.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/125952)  User \"JoJo\" writes: \"5% (SnV - Chalky.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Liquid Barn Green Apple, 1.5 and 3%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 18 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Warm, waxy artificial green apple.\n\nI do get some brighter green apple right at the beginning of this flavor.  There is an initial sharp burst of tart green apple that doesn't really follow through the entire vape.  After that initial sharpness fades I get almost a watery apple green apple candy flavor. More in the jolly rancher family than not, but not quite as vibrant as you'd expect for that candy type of flavor.\n\nI'm getting some weirder off-flavors from this.  Unsteeped there's a pretty heavy plastic note, but it kind of fades out to something fairly metallic and a bit odd overall.  There's also something a waxy warmth here that reminds me a lot of a warmer, heavier orange flavor.  The waxiness clashes with the brighter apple flavor you'd expect. The overall effect kind of makes think of green apple laffy taffy, but with a less saturated warmer flavor.  Nothing that tastes truly \"bad\" or jarring, but it's prominent enough to detract from the flavor a bit.\n\nThis doesn't actually taste a whole lot like any of the other green apple flavors I've tried.  Green apple tends to skew too bright, too sharp, and too aggressive.  This tastes duller overall.  On the bright side it manages to avoid all of the grassiness that usually comes with fresher takes on green apple, but the actual body of this flavor tastes a bit flat and strange.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Some plastic steeping into metallic notes. Waxy warmth.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Moderate.  Starts a bit harsh but kind of settles in.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  The suggested percentage on this is quite a bit lower than a lot of the liquid barn flavors at just 3%.\n\nAt 1.5% I get a fairly full front end on this flavor. That green apple up front isn't quite as tart, and while the body behind it is is a bit thin, it isn't as waxy and that metallic twinge is fairly light.  The off flavors here seem a bit more under control than the suggested 3%.\n\nAt 3% this is sweeter and tarter, but feels a bit more disjointed.  That waxy warmth is a pretty major component of the flavor and that metallic thing is fairly prominent.  The actual base here doesn't really seem all that much more full and saturated than the 1.5%. \n\nJust based on these tests, I'd probably be using this more as an accent flavor at around 1-1.5% with a relatively long steep for a fruit.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This gets a bit odd at relatively higher percentages, so I'd be more inclined to use this as a green apple accent on top of a fuller, juicier fruit.  Those green apple top notes should show up relatively well over other apple and pear flavors.\n\nAt the same time, this is on the artificial side, so you're mostly looking at a green apple accent in fruit or candy mixes.  Should work for more of a taffy base, although I could see this working okay for just a general green apple hard candy type of mix.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Here's the ELR Page.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/42887)  User \"jojo\" writes: \"1% (1 week - a little light, get a little apple and some plastic + anise flavor. 17 days - still light, less plastic. 24 days - a very nice green apple flavor.

I should probably mention that I definitely seem to be in the minority on the cream component here, so I'm probably broken?\n\nThe honeydew here is actually pretty nice.  I feel like it's a lighter flavor overall, but what is here is fairly accurate.  Reminds me of a pre-sliced honeydew that's sat out a bit.  There's no real rind to it, and it's more just soft than juicy.  I'm not picking up any soapy or off about it.  The softness makes it feel more like an accent than big, bright primary flavor.\n\nI also get a fairly heavy creaminess out of this.  It could theoretically be a richer cantaloupe flavor, but it feels a lot like an actual cream flavor.  It's smooth with a decent body, and some light buttery notes.  Seems pretty prominent in the mix and it kind of envelops that honeydew.  The overall effect is strangely pleasant.\n\nThis is fairly sweet overall and that creaminess does a lot for the texture.  This seems to have a good deal of ethyl alcohol to it, but at 3+ weeks out doesn't seem like too much of an issue.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Either I'm tasting something wrong here, or this has way more creaminess than I'd expect for a straight honeydew flavor.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  While most of that ethyl alcohol has steeped out to something more subtle, at 23 days I'm still getting a bit of bite out of it.  Overall a light to moderate throat hit, but it doesn't really match with how creamy this base is.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 3% I'm not getting too bold of a honeydew out of this.  I may just be used to more aggressive honeydews but this feels pretty tame this low.  Some light honey dew, and the creamier base is just a little chalky.\n\nThis seems to work a bit better at 6%.  That honeydew seems fuller and sweeter, and that creamy base has filled in quite a bit.\n\nLiquid Barn recommends mixing at 6% and I can't really argue.  Seems pretty solid.  I'd use this a primary flavor or base for some other fruits and creams.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This actually feels quite a bit more versatile than some of the other liquid barn flavors.  It should work well as a base for melons, especially playing up that creamy base with some additional cantaloupe.  FLV Cantaloupe seems like a good fit.  I think you could also add in some realistic, softer watermelon like FA or FLV for some additional depth here.\n\nShould play with brighter fruit flavors like strawberry or kiwi.  I think you could probably get a fruit salad type of vape if you stick with crisper tasting fruits like green apple or grapes.\n\nAlternatively, with the longer steep time, why not through in some FA Vienna Cream and really play up those creamy notes.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Here's the ELR Page.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/23046)  User \"jojo\" writes: \"8% (SnV - decent, sweet melon flavor but a bit of a plastic taste. 1 week - plastic has gone away now.

Don't expect any concrete level write up here :)*\n\n**Setup:** Narda Clone, Triple core alien (thanks loco) Nichrome 80 coil. 3x28g / 36g @.33 ohms.  45w power, Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** LB Lava Cake @4%, snv\n\n**Flavor Description:**  First off, I wanted to get this info out right away because I was excited about this flavor so it is not a full review. I mixed it up and loved it and looked right away to see if there was a review out for it. Since there isn't anything I thought I would bring it upon myself to spread the word.\n\n   This is a really good chocolate, finally! To me it tastes like the inside of a lava cake with maybe a crumb or two of the cake itself. It is a semi sweet chocolate with a bit of bakery behind it. I am assuming it is the ap ness of the flavor that actually is making this a decent chocolate. It is not overtly grainy so I think it could be covered up easily to turn this into a chocolate milk type flavor.\n\nThis is very smooth right on the shake and lingers in your palate a bit. It's not coat your mouth thick so can use some help with creams or sweetener if you want that lip smacking flavor. That being said, it does have enough inherent sweetness if you just want a chocolate accent to something, I don't think it needs any sweetener unless you are making the chocolate the main note.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Not a one, this is all chocolate, all of the time, pure and simple. Pretty accurate to the profile it is going after but I would add some additional cake-y flavors to push this a little more. \n\n**Throat Hit:** Very smooth, no tingle at all, even on the shake\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I would comfortably use this wherever you want a chocolate. Whether you throw creams at this to make a chocolate milk or layer in your favorite fruit for one of those brooks candies I think this would be a good choice. Like I stated earlier this is just a first look so I haven't made many mixes with it. I think this and flv red velvet would get along wonderfully to make it a more true lava cake. \n\n\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

    "markdown": "**Setup**: Asmodus C4 RDA, 0.45 ohm Alien clapton coil, 45 watt power\n\n**Testing**: LB Lava Cake (discontinued version) 6% & LB Lava Cake (new formula) 6% diluted with 80/20 3mg [UnJuice](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/114108#unjuice_by_kindground) by /u/kindground (Essential Depot VG/PG + CNT PG-based 100mg/ml freebase nicotine from Liquid Barn (LB). Steeped 5 days. \n\n**Background**: The original LB Lava Cake has been discontinued and replaced with a new formulation. Inquiring minds want to know, what's the difference?\n\n**Notes**: There are some variances in opinion or perception regarding what LB Lava Cake used to taste like, as you can see in these reviews by: [mlNikon](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/72wbyy/lb_lava_cake_first_look/), [ConcreteRiver](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/72wbyy/lb_lava_cake_first_look/dppcuu2/), and [Tamachicken](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/52mec3/lb_lava_cake/). \n\nFWIW, I never really got a full cake out of the old one, it pretty much tastes like hot fudge sundae topping with just the barest touch of something that might be cake. So, the stuff that comes oozing out of a Lava Cake, with barely any of the cake itself clinging to it. The hot fudge sundae topping-type flavor had just a very slight Tootsie Roll-ish quality that fortunately could easily get lost in a mix, but even as a single flavor Lava Cake was actually really good under the circumstances. The circumstances being that it’s a chocolate flavor, so it could have easily been so much worse. No gross band-aid flavor or anything like that.\n\nThe new version is *very* different, you can even look at it and see how different it is. It tastes more like light, fluffy chocolate cake, not especially heavy or rich, more like a chocolate Angel Food Cake than a Devil's Food Cake.  Not as chocolatey as a real chocolate cake either, like an under-chocolated chocolate angel food cake. So all of the previous recipes that rely on LB Lava Cake are **DEAD.** There’s no way this works as a substitute, it’s way too different. Just absolutely dead. Pour one out for my homies. \n\nIn terms of off-notes, still not bad whatsoever for a chocolatey flavor. I thought it seemed maybe a little perfumey on the first hit or two, but after that, no. Just under-chocolated fluffy chocolate cake that’s also a little **undercooked**. It has a little bit of a raw flour taste to it, like cake batter has, and the tiniest bit of a raw cocoa flavor as well. Enough of both that if you found the right chocolate to add it to make it chocolately enough, you could easily make a chocolate cake batter vape out of it without any of the cake batter flavors.  \n\n**Throat hit**: None.  \n\n**Usage suggestions**: If you want to vape a chocolate cake using this, I would recommend something to make it richer, like a butter flavor or a touch of heavy custard/vanilla ice cream if you can get that to blend in. And more chocolate, obviously, and best of luck with that. And then probably another cake (JF Yellow Cake or one of the WF cakes, for example) or other bakery flavor (CAP Sugar Cookie?) to keep from burying the bakery and to cover up the some of the undercooked aspect. At that point, you're basically building a chocolate cake yourself from the ground up anyway, so I'm not convinced LB Lava Cake is necessary, though it might help quite a bit to get all those disparate ingredients to cooperate with each other.  \n\nAnd then if you want to vape a Lava Cake, you'll need something entirely different for the lovely goo in the center unless you've still got some of the old Lava Cake on hand and don't care about future mixers being able to mix and enjoy your recipe. \n\n**Disclaimer**: 5 days is a really short steep on a bakery and this might change over time (if I had to guess, I wouldn't bet on it changing much, but it might get more cakey, bakery flavors like to come out with some steep, and less raw). I was encouraged to post this half-assed review/comparison because there's some interest in what LB has done to Lava Cake, and I happened to have a bottle of each mixed at the same time at the same concentration anyway for FOTW: Chocolate Cake.\n\nedit: a word",

Shout out to Liquid Barn*\n\n**Setup:** Recoil w/ flavor barrel, Dual 15 wrap 26g 3mm Nifethal 70 coils @.17 ohms.  60w power, 450F temp limit. Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Liquid Barn Orange Banana, 5 and 9%  @ 1g/ml, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 36 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  A smoothie blend of banana and orange, with a fairly harsh and sharp edge.\n\nThe banana here tastes a bit more vibrant than straight LB Banana, but it's definitely similar.  Feels like there is some more realistic underripe-ish banana in here along with a artificial banana taffy or runts note. The balance here is actually pretty good, and while I do get a bit of artificial banana, it's not just straight runts.  Not as realistic or green as something like FA Banana, but it's a bit more realistic than some other options.\n\nThe orange flavor here is actually pretty well done.  It's definitely on the sharp side but it's a decently realistic navel orange kind of flavor, and not heavily artificial.  I do pick up some fairly harsh zest out this but it actually has a bit of orange juice in there as well.  The orange is helping tone down the artificial banana and the banana is helping to give that orange a bit of body.\n\nLiquid barn says this is a similar to a smoothie, and it does have a fairly thick body.  But this is definitely on the harsh and sharp side.  There's quite a bit of bite here right up front from an acidic sharpness and some pretty intense throat hit.  The sharpness detracts from that smoothie-esque profile.\n\nLiquid Barn says this has the \"cooling sensation of a creamsicle\" but I'm not really picking anything like that up.  I don't get any real discrete cooling, and if there is some cooling in here it's probably a very small percentage of Koolada because I don't taste any menthol.  Tasting it on the back of the hand, I get it a bit more clearly, but it's got to be down around the equivalent of .1% Koolada or something minor like that.\n\nSo shoutout to liquid barn for giving info on the base for each of their flavors.  This is 40% VG, and 60% other with no mention of PG.  They list ethyl alcohol as one of the components, so this is probably north of 50% ethyl alcohol.  So that would explain some of the sharpness and also pretty much ensure you're looking at a sizable steep to let this calm down.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  So even with a steep this still feels way too sharp for the profile.  Some artificial banana, but not bad in the profile.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  This is fairly harsh for me.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  This actually feels a bit more harsh for me at 5% than at 9%.  I'm getting much orange than banana, and it's thin and zest heavy.  I'm maybe getting some of that cooling, but it's really hard to tell through the throat hit.\n\nAt 9% this feels a bit better balanced.  There's quite a bit more banana here and the orange feels fuller.  Banana is pushing a little artificial but the actual texture is quite a bit thicker.  There's still some significant throat hit, but there's more flavor to soak it up.\n\nLiquid Barn suggests mixing this at 9%.  It's pretty harsh up that high, but the balance does seem to be quite a bit better than 5%.  I'd probably be mixing between 7-8%, with the caveat that you're going to managing throat hit at that kind of level.  There's not really enough banana here at an accent percentage, and you have better accent options for a straight orange.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This does definitely feel like the beginning of a smoothie.  You could go the philosaphucker route that he used with [Detox](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/15465#detox_by_philosaphucker) and try to mellow this out with some cactus while adding a bit of a green juice kind of vibe.  If you didn't want to mess with cactus, some TPA Whipped Cream would add some triacetin to smooth this out and take it closer to an orange julius.\n\nAdding cream or marshmallow would start you toward more a tropical creamsicle while cutting down on the throat hit a bit.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Here's the ELR Page.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/23047)  User \"jojo\" writes: \"8% (SnV - not bad, kinda weak. 1 week - still not getting a lot from this.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Liquid Barn Pacific Cooler, 3 and 6%  @ 1g/ml, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 39 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  So this is definitely trying to go after the capri sun flavor.  There's a empty foil drink pouch included in the official liquid barn promo image.  Pacific cooler is supposed to be pineapple, apple, and grape... and all of those are in the promo picture as well.\n\nThere is mostly some sort of generic, sweetened juice flavor.There could well be apple, grape, and pineapple in here but they're all extremely soft and melt together.  There is maybe some slightly more distinct pineapple, but I'm feeling it more in the tartness than a really strong pineapple flavor.  I'd stil call it \"fruity\" as the dominant profile, and while it's pretty heavily sweet overall it doesn't taste quite candied.  So maybe points for realism if not actual flavor.\n\nI think I also taste some strawberry in here?  I'm a pretty heavy strawberry non-taster, but I definitely pick up some of the weirder off-notes I get from LB Strawberry instead of tasting actual strawberry.  So either the combination of flavors here is an accurate representation of being a strawberry non-taster, or there's an actual strawberry in here.\n\nThis feels a bit dull and muted for me.  This vapes a little warm, and the fruit is just a bit waxy.  You've got a solid sweetness, but not a whole lot of vibrancy.  This is a bit brighter as a S&V, but it's quite a bit harsher too, so dialing in the steep is going to be fairly difficult if you want to avoid the throat hit.  As a S&V there is a bit of juiciness here, but the steeped sample is actually tasting a bit dry.  A bit of density, but no real texture.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Fairly accurate overall to sort of poor source material.  I think there's strawberry in here, so that wouldn't really fit with the pacific cooler thing.  Flavor is a bit warm and waxy.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Moderate.  Steeps out quite a bit smoother at the expense of flavor vibrancy.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  The 3% steeped sample of this is really light.  Sort of a watered down juice box kind of flavor overall.  Nothing really sticks out and I'm having a hard time finding any really distinct flavor here.\n\n6% steeped is also kind of a dull flavor, but it's a little bit fuller, and quite a bit sweeter.  I'm getting that strawberry-esque thing a lot more clearly here than at 3%.\n\nMy S&V test was all the way up 10%.  This actually seemed to work a bit better and I was starting to get a bit more tartness and vibrancy.\n\nLiquid Barn suggests mixing this at 6%, and either I'm not tasting everything going on here or that seems low.  It's quite a bit more vibrant up at 10%.  I don't think is really intense enough to work at a low percentage as an accent, I'd stick to a primary flavor or a base flavor with the caveat that almost anything else you throw at this is going to stick out above this concentrate.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This works fairly well as a solo flavor at 10% with a short steep, but seems to fade out with a steep.  Should pair well with champagnes to thin it out a bit, and a bit of cooling if you really want to try to get to a capri sun.\n\nOutside of a trying to emulate a capri sun, this is probably a bit more limited.  Sweet, fruity background noise, mostly.  I don't think there are too many fruits that wouldn't work with this in the background.  It's kind of a choose-your-own-adventure flavor in terms of additions, especially after a steep.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[The creator of Pacific Cooler struggles with his regrets.](http://www.clickhole.com/blogpost/if-i-knew-pacific-cooler-would-overshadow-all-othe-2703)\n\n[Here's the ELR Page.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/23051)  User \"jojo\" writes: \"6% (SnV - a tropical punch vibe.

I get a more yellow peach type of flavor, but it doesn't have those heavy peach rings kind of flavors you'd expect from that.  It's a bit on the artificial side, but it doesn't really call too much attention to itself.  Overall the peach isn't particularly aggressive or vibrant. It's kind of flat and indistinct.\n\nThere's a pretty sharp bite to this, which is a little weird for a 95% VG flavor.  Peach flavors can get fairly harsh, but it doesn't quite seem to translate to as much throat hit as I'd expect.  Sort of an acidic sharpness to the flavor though, and it almost gets a bit metallic with extended vaping.\n\nThis has a noticeable butryic accent to it.  It really reminds me of the sort of barnyard funk in a lot of green apple flavors.  It has that same body-odor bordering on grassy sour milk around the edges and especially on the tail end of the flavor.  It's not quite unsteeped V2 or DX levels of vomity, but it's definitely there, even after a longer steep.\n\nWith all that said, beyond the sharpness and the barnyard, there is a pretty decent texture here.  It's not quite juicy, more kind of mealy like a red delicious apple.  It's a bit hard to get through with the off flavors, but there's also an interesting thickness to the body of the fruit.\n\nThis has had a fairly long steep for a fruit, so that could have something to do with the lack of vibrancy.  Testing this as a S&V, those off-flavors are even more aggressive, so I'm thinking this is definitely a long steep kind of flavor even if that does affect the vibrancy.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  The weird barnyard-ish almost butryic funk is still pretty prominent after a steep.  I'm also getting something sharp and almost metallic here.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light to moderate throat hit, but a bit of a sharp and acidic mouthfeel right up front.  I'm not extremely sensitive to throat hit, but I can see this being more harsh if throat hit is an issue for you with other peach flavors.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 5%, the peach here is pretty soft but i'm getting an odd metallic taste on the backend.  Not particularly sharp, but that butryic edge is definitely still there if not too aggressive overall.\n\nAt 10% the peach here is a bit more solid and the backend feels less metallic.  This feels a bit acidic this high.  That butryic note is also quite a bit stronger.\n\nLiquid barn suggests mixing this at 10%, but that feels like too much of those off-notes.  Just based on these tests, I'd be using this a texturizing accent around 3-4%.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This is a deeply odd take on a peach flavor.  More than anything it reminds of a much less intense version of FLV Pear, with that kind of mealy texture and butryic note.  I was pretty skeptical about pear until trying Fear's [Bloody Mango Sorbet](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/55649#bloody_mango_sorbet_by_fear) with his sort-of recommended FLV Pear addition.  As unpleasant as FLV Pear is as a solo flavor, it does crazy things for texture.  I'm thinking you may be able to use this in a similar way.  I'd definitely be relatively low on this at around 3-4% and have a bunch of other bright fruits in the forefront to hide this one in the background.\n\nOutside of niche texturizing, I'm not sure this works well enough as a peach flavor to really recommend over other available peach options.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Here's the ELR Page.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/11665)  User \"jojo\" writes: \"6% (SnV - not super potent.

The actual coconut is thick and slightly waxy. This feels really similar to Liquid Barn's straight coconut milk.  A realistic coconut base with some more aggressive suntan lotion artificial notes.  I am getting a bit of that weird spiciness I got from the coconut milk solo, but it's relatively light and the pineapple helps distract from it a bit.\n\nThe pineapple here actually feels a bit more vibrant than straight LB Pineapple.  I'm still getting a light acidity and tartness out of it, but there seems to be a bit more actual body to it.  It's still kind of somewhere between realistic and candy, but the added vibrancy works to make it a bit more interesting.\n\nI'm not sure if it's just the pineapple, or the combination of the pineapple and the artificial parts of the coconut, but I kind of get a banana-ish flavor out of this.  It's not completely overwhelming with the coconut going on underneath it, but it gets in the way of the pineapple for me.\n\nThis has a thicker, denser mouthfeel.  I'm not picking up anything like cooling.  I'd say it's sweet but not cloying.  Seems like a good fit overall for that pina colada mix type of profile.\n\nThe sort of vague pineapple and those banana notes, the thickness and waxiness of that coconut, and the complete lack of rum remind me more of a jug of pina colada mix rather than a pina colada made with fresher ingredients and precious, precious booze.  It's still probably a fit for the profile, but overall it just tastes a bit artificial.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Some artificial banana nestled in there. Coconut has a weird bit of spiciness attached.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light to moderate, at least steeped.  I do pick up some throat hit from the pineapple and that weird spice note, but that coconut is thick and smooth.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 8% I'm getting a good amount of coconut out of this.  It doesn't quite have the crazy, thick waxiness but i doesn't have some of the more aggressive artificial coconut notes. The pineapple is a bit tart and sharp up front, but there isn't too much sweet body to it.  That banana thing seems a bit less pronounced as well.  Overall mouthfeel is sort of thick but one-dimensional.  The middle of the flavor feels a bit thin.\n\nAt 16% the coconut is definitely thick and heavy.  It's fairly waxy, but the denseness is nice.  The pineapple is still a bit tart up front, but I'm getting more of that sweet body.  I'm getting quite a bit of artificial banana here as well.  Seems a bit over-flavored, and I'm getting some issues with muting after a couple of drags.\n\nLiquid barn suggests a whopping 16% with this, and while it doesn't taste bad, it's probably overkill.  Just based on these tests I'd probably be closer to 10% as a base or solo flavor.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Totally competent as a single flavor.  It would probably be better with some rum, although FA Jamaican Rhum is probably going to end up making this even sweeter.

Nothing offensive steeped, but not a whole lot that really stands out.\n\nThe pineapple here feels pretty flat to me.  It straddles the line a bit between something realistic and a sweeter candy pineapple.  On the realistic side, it has a bit of acidity to it, but it's doesn't have much of a juicy body.  It has kind of a canned pineapple taste going on but without the real juiciness of CAP Golden Pineapple.  On the more candied side, there's some sweetness and waxiness to it but the flavor itself feels pretty muted and thin.  Pineapple is generally supposed to be pretty vibrant, but this is pretty tame.\n\nI'm not getting much texture out of this.  Mostly a slightly acidic hit up front than a flat, thin pineapple. I do notice a bit of waxiness in here, but it's not completely overwhelming.\n\nThis has had a fairly long steep for a fruit.  Tasting this a S&V there's definitely a more intense flavor, but it has a pretty heavy plastic type off-note to it.  It's substantially brighter, but that off-note is a little too prominent to be enjoyable.  I'm not sure there's a steep time that will make this work substantially better.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Unsteeped, some heavier plastic notes but those die way down on a steep.  Steeped, this feels a bit waxy and flat.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light to moderate.  Some harsher acidity, but not bad for a pineapple.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  This feels pretty vague at 4%.  Some acidity right at the front like pineapple, but not much actual pineapple flavor.\n\nAt 8% I'm getting a bit more acidity at the front, but this is still pretty undersaturated.  Pineapple is coming through a little bit more clearly but it's still not really vibrant. \n\nLiquid Barn suggests mixing at 8% with.  Just based on these tests, that doesn't seem like a bad place to start.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I'm not sure there are too many applications where another readily available pineapple won't work a bit better.  If you want canned pineapple, try CAP.  If you want realistic, try INW, and if you want tarter for a candy base, try TPA.  All of those are more vibrant, more potent, and a bit more interesting.\n\nIf you do pick this up, I think it's more a background note for tropical or beverage type mixes.  It doesn't really have the flavor saturation to stand in front of mix, but it could add some tart dimension to other fruits or a sort of fruity body to beverages.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Here's the ELR Page.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/36310)  User \"jojo\" writes: \"8% (SnV - Tastes like a pineapple, but definitely has a bit of the chemical note I’ve gotten in some of the other LB fruits. 1 week - same.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Liquid Barn Pink Lemonade, 4 and 8%  @ 1g/ml, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 38 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Instant pink lemonade, sweet and a bit harsh.\n\nThe tastes a whole lot more like powdered and reconstituted lemonade mix than anything involving an actual lemon. It's distinctly a lemonade as opposed to sweetened lemon flavor.  It's a sharp, tart lemon, but there's no realistic zest and there's a whole bunch of sweetness going on as well.  The overall effect is a very lemonade-ish relatively dense body.\n\nLike Blue Raspberry, there isn't much but wild speculation on the internet about what actually makes a pink lemonade flavor pink.  It ranges from just more sugar, some kind of actual fruit like strawberries, raspberry, or cranberry, or just straight Red 40.  I'm obviously not going to settle this here, but I will say this definitely tastes pink.  Gun to my head, I'd say it's a really intensely candied raspberry kind of flavor, but it's blended in almost entirely to the lemonade base.  The extra sweetness over a more realistic lemonade probably helps as well.  So on a scale of 1 to pink, I'd say it's like a 8.  It's noticeably pink.\n\nThis is a pretty intensely sweet flavor.  At the suggested 8% it's almost like someone added some extra sugar to the pre-sweetened lemonade mix.  The actual lemonade flavor doesn't feel as over-concentrated as the sweetness.  I'm thinking there's some additional sweetener in here because I'm getting a pretty heavy sugar lips and  a bit of coil gore.  The heavy sweetness is also feeling just a little bit powdery and I'm getting just a bit of dryness out this.\n\nThis is aggressive on throat hit.  Something about the combination of the citrus, the sweetness, and the ethyl alcohol in the base is pretty intense.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Nah.  I mean, a whole lot of sugar, but it fits the profile pretty well.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Harsh.  There's a lot of ethyl alcohol, sharp citrus, and sort of a dry heavily sweet note.  Even after a long steep it's still pretty intense.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 4% I'm actually getting a fairly good amount of lemonade here.  It's fairly sharp, tart, and bright.  It's sweet at 4%, but not quite overwhelming.  The pink here is also a little more subtle and it's less fruity and less candied than at 8%.\n\nAt 8% I'm not getting much more lemon, but a whole lot more sugar and pink.  Throat hit seems relatively similar to 4%.\n\nLiquid Barn suggests 8%, and that's probably pretty close if you want a single or primary flavor pink lemonade.  The sweetness and the pink are the primary thing scaling on percentage.  I'd probably be closer to 5% because I'm a joyless DIY scold and it tastes pink enough to recognizable for me a bit lower.  I think at lower accent percentage you'll mostly get a tart, sweet lemon accent.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  If you're not scared of throat hit, this is a pretty solid solo flavor.  I think you definitely get sweet, pink, and lemonade.  But add some cooling, because we aren't animals and the it should cut down some of the overwhelming sweetness at the tail end of the exhale.\n\nIf you wanted to work on that throat hit a bit, ethyl maltol works pretty well to blunt the edges of it.  You could also really play up the pink think and toss in a maltol heavy strawberry like TPA or even LB strawberry.  Good base for other berry additions like raspberries, blackcurrant, or even some CAP hibiscus if you really want it sweet.\n\nThis would also be a pretty great base for pink lemonade candy flavors. It has a lot of the sweetness to pull off those heavier candy profiles, and a lot of the texturizers will help round out some of the harder edges.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Here's the ELR Page.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/23554)  User \"jojo\" writes: \"6% (SnV - tastes like lemonade with a bit of a bitter note. 1 week - this is pretty nice.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Liquid Barn Pumpkin Pie, 8 and 15%  @ 1g/ml, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 22 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**\n\nWhile this has a bit more going on in the background, it's pretty heavy on the spice.  It's more from the \"pumpkin spice\" family than a full on pumpkin pie.  The spice mix is pretty standard pumpkin spice.  It seems to lead with a relatively heavy bakery clove.  There's a good deal of warmth from the clove and that's reinforced by something like a cinnamon or maybe even a ginger on the back end, but I'm picking it up more as a spice warmth than a super distinct flavor.  I'd also say there is maybe a bit of nutmeg hiding in there somewhere, but pumpkin spice is kind of difficult to really pick apart.  Overall, it definitely comes across as a pumpkin spice.\n\nThere's some actual pie hiding behind that bolder spice note.  Feels like mostly a graham cracker kind of crust.  I'm not sure if it's just the dryness of the spice up front, but it comes across as a dry graham cracker crust.  I'm not picking up any butter or real richness to the crust and the spice is wreaking a bit of havoc with the texture.  Lighter graham notes overall.\n\nI think I pick up just a bit of creamy pumpkin on the tail end of this.  It actually shows up more on the breath you take after vaping this.  Really light cream or custard notes and something vague and more pumpkin-esque.  It seems very light overall.  This is much more about the spice and the crust.  I think whatever pumpkin filling is mostly working to give the entire concentrate a bit more body and keeping those spices from going completely dry and thin.  Sweetness level seems about right for a pumpkin pie.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  The spice here ends up tasting a bit rubbery like smelling fresh tires.  There's something just a bit chemical to it.  Seems to fade down a bit with a steep, but it's prominent enough to be noticeable after 3 weeks.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Moderate, which is actual pretty good for something with this much pumpkin spice.  There's a bit of body that mellows everything out from just straight spice notes.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 8%, this is still pretty spice forward.  It's not completely overwhelming for a whole bunch of spices, but it's still mostly spice.  I get a really light bakery in the background but pretty much no filling.\n\nAt 15% The spice doesn't seems all that much more intense.  Maybe just a touch more bakery underneath it, but still fairly light.  You can just barely get some pumpkin in the there, but the mouthfeel is a bit thicker.\n\nLiquid barn suggests mixing with this all the way up at 15%.  Just because that spice doesn't really scale in linear fashion, and there's a bit more body to it that's probably not a bad idea for solo flavor.  If you were going to start accenting this, I'd move down to around 10%.  This should be fairly flexible as an accent for a pumpkin spice, I'd start around 2-3% for that.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  It's not really a full pumpkin pie solo, but it's not bad as a solo flavor if you really need some pumpkin spice in your life.\n\nIf you wanted to fill out for a pie, you're looking at some pretty usual suspects for boosting the crust and trying to fill out the filling.  TPA Pie Crust, INW Biscuit, or your crust of choice and then some INW Custard and maybe TPA Pumpkin for the filling?  Or maybe just fill it out with some HS Pumpkin Pie if that's your thing.\n\nAs a pumpkin spice, you're looking at all the usual nonsense with creams, coffees, bakeries, and tobaccos.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Here's the ELR Page.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/125952)  User \"BikerDude\" writes: \"@ 10% decent pumpkin flavor with a hint of pie crust on inhale, pumpkin spice on exhale.

There is some cream to it, though it's more of a freezepop icy than ice cream. This is more of the orange / blue variant of sherbet. Mainly the orange part. I know it's all around the same flavor, just different color, but I get the feeling of orange, not the flavor but the color. There is a hint of blue, whatever that is, on the back of the exhale. Light sweetness not from the flavor, but the VG. The first few drags tasted like straight VG. \n\n**Off-flavors**: This comes as a mainly VG based solution, 85/15, so the taste of VG is quite present.  \n\n**Throat Hit**: None, very light and smooth.\n\n**Uses & Pairings**: Creams definite, it needs something to bring out the texture and give it volume. Some bakery type flavors maybe? I am not sure what sherbet can be used in other than just eaten straight from the container.\n\n**Notes**: Could be the fact I used a single coil, but this left me pretty disappointed. The overpowering VG made me wonder if I was even doing this right. It's my first attempt at single flavor testing.\n\nMy brother made a sherbet recipe the first day we got everything. He says he can taste it more, since the recipe is also used with other LiquidBarn flavorings, so makes me think a cream base is needed for Rainbow Sherbet to really shine.  \n\n**Recipe**  \nLB Rainbow Sherbet - 8%  \nLB Vanilla Bean Ice Cream - 5%  \nLB Cream - 2%\n\nNot bad for a first attempt for someone who didn't have any knowledge of how mixing works, just knowing he needed an overall percentage.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Liquid Barn Root Beer, 5 and 9%  @ 1g/ml, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 40 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** A solid root beer, but a bit flat overall.\n\nIf you check the second opinions, someone calls out \"root beer barrels\" with this, and that seems like a pretty apt description.  Overall it's not really sharp like a Barq's, creamy like an A&W, or spicy like a fancy craft-ish root beer.  It's definitely root beer, but it's kind of undersaturated for such an intense profile.  It's sort of warm and sweet without much bite.  So, either a flat can of store brand root beer or the aforementioned barrels.\n\nThe actual spice mix here is pretty good for root beer.  I get mostly wintergreen and a touch of vanilla.  The wintergreen here is solid, and brings in a bit of cooling that feels like a fit for the profile.  This doesn't have too much in the way of spicy licorice or anise-ish notes to it. Not particularly spicy, but what is here is identifiably root beer.\n\nThis is definitely sweet, but it's kind of a straight sugar kind of sweetness.  It doesn't have a ton of molasses or caramel kind of darker sweetness.  The vanilla here is also a little bit bright and not that darker vanilla extract kind of taste.  The mouthfeel here is okay, at least in the steeped version.  It doesn't quite feel dense, but there is just a bit of creamyness to the body.  I'm not getting anything that's emulating a carbonation.\n\nI think this suffers a bit from some strong competition.  CAP Root Beer has a dark sweetness and is a bit fuller, and would probably work a bit better as the base for a sweet, sticky root beer.  FW Root Beer has a really intense spiciness and does a great job on top notes.  And FLV Root Beer is spot on, if also a bit top heavy, and does a really interesting foamy root beer very well.  There's nothing major wrong here, but I'm not sure if there's a really compelling reason to use this as it's substantially less concentrated and doesn't quite do any aspect of root beer as well as some of the competition.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Nah.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Very light.  Steeped I'm not getting much at all.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 5% there's relatively more root beer spice than body.  You pick up some relatively heavy wintergreen, and some actual spicier notes but there isn't much body beyond some sweetness.\n\nAt 9% this has quite a bit more sweet body, and it has just a bit of creaminess.  You lose some of the nuance of the spice note, and I mostly get wintergreen and light vanilla here.\n\nThis has been steeped for quite a while, so trying this S&V at 10% it's definitely a bit more vibrant.  I'm getting a light throat hit but the spice notes are a lot more intense.  Still sweet, but not too much creamy body.\n\nLiquid Barn suggests mixing this at 9%, and just based on these tests that's probably in the ballpark.  I think you could easily go a bit higher up to 12% for a solo flavor and I wouldn't really steep over 3 weeks.  This is a bit flat to work well as an accent at a lower percentage, and it'll pretty much always taste like root beer so that limits those kinds of applications.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  There's nothing wrong with this per se, but it probably needs some help as a convincing single flavor root beer, mostly with fullness and texture.  Using some LB Cola Freeze could help fill in the bottom end with a heavier caramel sweetness, and the spice top notes should still come through fairly well.  You could also go the float route and fill out the body with an ice cream flavor.\n\nIf you wanted to play up the root beer barrel thing, some sucralose is going to get you most of the way there.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Here's the ELR Page.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/23053)  User \"jojo\" writes: \"3% (2 days - sweet root beer and even tastes kinda fizzy.

Solid bakery cinnamon without being too intensely dry or having any weird off notes.  Cinnamon level seems like a fit for the profile, fairly prominent in the mix but not overwhelming.  No real body to the cinnamon, tastes just a little thin and can pick up a bit of cinnamon red-hot kind astringency at higher percentages.  The cinnamon is pretty much dominating the top notes here, so it actually comes across a bit like a snickerdoodle would with the cinnamon on top.\n\nThe cookie base here is rich.  I'm not a diketone scientist, but [5,000 ppm of both Acetoin and Acetyl Propionyl](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0307/9897/files/Snickerdoodle_DS.jpg?5513177427726715981) seems pretty intense.  There is a heavier, dense base to the cookie.  There's not a ton of \"butter\" taste to it, but it's definitely a thicker, buttery mouthfeel.  There's a bit of blond sugar cookie taste here, but not much texture to carry it.  I'm not picking up anything crispy or dark here, and a really soft almost fluffy grain.  Less texture than CAP Sugar Cookie, and nowhere near the crispier, darker FA Cookie.\n\nOverall effect almost comes off more like a cinnamon sugar cookie dough just because of that lack of texture and heavier, rich mouthfeel.  Fairly sweet, but nothing obnoxious and a fit for the profile.\n\n**Off-flavors:**At higher percentages cinnamon gets a bit aggressive and candyish.  Very light cookie taste and not much cookie texture.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  There's a decent amount of cinnamon here, so that picks up a moderate bite.  Beyond that cinnamon, flavor is smooth without any real harshness.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 5% I'm getting a fairly mild cinnamon and some richer mouthfeel but not too much in the way of cookie notes.  Feels a bit unsaturated as a solo flavor.\n\nAt 10% the cinnamon is actually a bit overbearing for me and I'm getting a touch of red hots.  Heavy body, but very little cookie texture, and a lighter actual sugar cookie flavor.\n\nLiquid Barn suggests mixing at 10%, that seems a bit intense on the cinnamon and that heavier mouthfeel.  I'd probably be closer to 7% with some additional cookie backup primarily for texture.  Not a super intense flavor but the cinnamon and richness should translate well as an accent around 4%.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This feels like it's basically 4% of CAP Sugar Cookie from being a really nicely fleshed out snickerdoodle.  You could go the FA Cookie route if you want a crispier cinnamon-based cookie.  Or live dangerously, use both.  I'm not your mom.\n\nOutside of just filling out a snickerdoodle, this should be usable as pretty standard bakery cinnamon with some extra DAAP for good measure.  There's a lot of options there like FW Cinnamon Roll, CAP Cinnamon Roll, LB Bakers Touch, and FLV Rich Cinnamon so it's a bit harder to recommend, but it'll do the job.  Use in standard stuff like danishes, coffee cakes, cinnamon rolls, and spiced cake type applications.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Here's the ELR Page.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/20199)  User \"JoJo\" writes: \"8% (SnV - I think I’m gonna like this.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Liquid Barn Sour Gummy, 9 and 17%  @ 1g/ml, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 28 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Sour-ish, \"red\", and waxy but doesn't really come across as an actual gummy for me.\n\nThe gummy in question in here is a bit indistinct.  I don't pick up much here beyond a vague \"red\" kind of flavor.  It's almost like a swedish fish kind of red, but not nearly as vibrant as that sounds.  There's something juicy, mellow, and sort of neutral like an apple to it, but the finish has some of those really familiar red fruit / cherry plastic notes.  It's not particularly saturated or intense, even up at that monster 17%.  It's definitely a kind of candy flavor, but the base is undersweet and thin.\n\nThis actually feels a bit sour.  Given how the watery the base here feels after a steep, I'm inclined to say it's probably something pretty normal like malic or citric acid.  With that said, it suffers from the same issues as using normal sour additives.  It isn't really a true puckering kind of sour, it's more just a sort of interesting tartness. The combination of the plasticy notes from the candy here and that acid up front is a bit harsh as well.\n\nThe texture isn't quite there for a gummy for me.  The mouthfeel is definitely waxy, which is part of a gummy profile, but the body is really flat and thin.  It doesn't have the chewiness and density of a gummy flavor.  The mouthfeel is more like licking gummy bears, with all of that weird caranuba wax kind of coating but none of that actual body.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  The actual candy flavor here has some red fruit plastic notes on the finish.  A bit hollow from the \"sour\" with no body.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Moderate.  It's not unbearable after a steep but it's really intense right off a shake.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 9%, I'm getting mostly waxy, red, and thin.  Some sour notes, but not much body for them to really hang on to. Sort of watery, with a moderate plastic off-note at the back of the flavor.\n\nAt 17%, this feels way too red and those plastic off-notes are pretty intense.  Very sticky and waxy, but still no real body.  Doesn't actually taste much more sour.\n\nLiquid Barn suggests 17%, which is a whole lot of off-notes for me.  I'd be well below that, at maybe 4-5% solely as an additive.  This doesn't seem to work as a solo for me.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I'd skip this one solo, or even as a primary flavor in a mix if you're at all sensitive to plastic-ish off-notes.\n\nI'd probably trying this out with some pre-existing gummy or candy concentrates, and using it to try to convey some of that sour.  Should pair reasonably well with stuff like the new SilverLine 27 Bears and 27 Fishes.\n\nOutside of use with existing gummy concentrates, you could probably throw this in with FA Blackcurrant and some sweetener to fill out the red gummy direction this seems to want to go in.  Maybe some TPA Red Licorice too.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Here's the ELR Page.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/206886)  User \"jojo\" writes: \"SnV - Plasticy, slightly waxy, and chemically.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Liquid Barn Sweet Pipe Tobacco, 5 and 10%  @ 1g/ml, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 33 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Mostly just sweet, almost no tobacco.  Might have some use as a tobacco enhancer but it really doesn't come across a tobacco by itself.\n\nI'm getting very little tobacco out of this.  There's maybe a bit of that slightly dirty warm harshness you get from TPA RY4 Double, but it's pretty light overall.  If they didn't have it in the concentrate name this wouldn't ever really register as as any kind of tobacco.  Nothing leafy, smoky, ashy, nutty, or fruity in here.\n\nIt's definitely sweet though.  It has a really light kind of vanilla to it, somewhere between cream soda and a marshmallow, with some light fluffier mouthfeel.  This feels a whole lot like FA Oba Oba.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  An almost complete lack of the \"pipe tobacco\" part of \"sweet pipe tobacco.\"\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light.  Not much at all.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 5%, I'm not getting all that much out of this.  Light vanilla, light mouthfeel, maybe a tiny bit of that mystery tobacco-ish vibe.\n\nAt 10%, this is mostly just sweetness, light vanilla, and a bit more of that mouthfeel.  Any of that mystery tobacco that might be in there at 5% is covered up.\n\nLiquid Barn suggests 10% with this, and it's fine there in terms of a lack of off-notes, but there isn't any tobacco.  I think if you are going to be using this, you'd be best served by treating it like Oba Oba.  Somwhere around 4% should be vaguely equivalent to .5% Oba Oba.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  So this definitely isn't a solo flavor, or even a primary flavor in a mix.  It seems like it's mostly going to be useful as a sweet tobacco additive, sort of making another bolder tobacco flavor into a sweet pipe tobacco.\n\nTrying this at 7% with FLV Cavendish @ 3%, it definitely seems to knock some of the harsher edges off, sweeten the mix, and add some mouthfeel.  The vanilla in this doesn't really come through.  Largely the same results with 3% FLV Kentucky Blend, and 3% FLV Oriental Tobacco.\n\nIt's hard to recommend this over FA Oba Oba just because the pretty immense gulf in concentration, but if you already have it, it can be used in largely the same fashion.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Here's the ELR Page.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/67288)  User \"JoJo\" writes: \"6% (SnV - pretty light, sweet, generic.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Liquid Barn Tobacco, 5 and 9%  @ 1g/ml, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 31 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Liquid Barn describes this as \"A southern blend of Old World Tobacco infused with the pleasant, nutty aroma of clove and the lingering hint of ripe berries.\"  I get a whole lot of clove, some herbal-ish tobacco, and just the slightest hint of anything fruity.\n\n\"Infused\" seems to be underselling the clove quite a bit.  There is quite a bit of clove in here.  It's a dry, spicy tobacco clove.  This doesn't exactly taste like a clove cigarette, but it's definitely the type of clove you'd find in a cigarette.  This doesn't really have the sweetness behind it to come across as a bakery clove.  Clove flavors tend to burn out my palate really quickly.  I feel like the clove flavors that work well just fade to a less intense version of themselves, like FLV Clove.  The cloves that work a bit less well turn kind of sour and thin.  The clove here seems to more from the former category.  It definitely starts to mute out with extended vaping, but nothing weird happens to it as it fades.  It maybe picks up a bit of chalkiness and a bit more of an anise type note, but it doesn't have any of the odd sourness I get with TPA or FA Clove.\n\nThe tobacco here seems to be working as a base for the clove more than anything else.  Fairly dark, herbal and a bit aromatic.  Tastes like a bit of anise or sassafras style of dark herbal notes, but it's hard to pull that apart from the more overwhelming clove.  No leather, smoke, or ash to it.\n\nIf I didn't read \"ripe berries\" in the description, I probably wouldn't have picked them out.  Very subtle light fruitiness in here.  Some tannic, dark berry skin more than anything distinctly fruity.  Reminds me a bit of some of the muskier notes from FA Bilberry.  No real sweetness to the fruit.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Just based on the description of the flavor, I'd say there's too much clove, not enough tobacco, and the berries are barely there.  Nothing that tastes out-of-place or chemical. The clove gets a little bit chalky with extended vaping.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Moderate.  That clove has quite a bit of bite, but not out of line for a tobacco-ish flavor.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 5% this is still fairly clove forward, but those herbal tobacco note show through a bit more.  While that clove packs a punch, the tobacco underneath feels a bit thin.  Very light fruit.\n\nAt 9%, the clove is pretty intense and dominates the vape.  Tobacco underneath feels a bit lost, but it provides a thicker, more solid base.  Fruit is almost completely lost.\n\nLiquid Barn suggests mixing this at 9%.  I think the flavor works well up there, but you have to really dig cloves.  This should work well as an accent for adding clove to other tobaccos at 3-4%, although there are more versatile and much more potent options out there for that.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This is surprisingly solid as a solo flavor if you dig clove.  It could use a bit of non-aromatic but still fairly dark tobacco backup like FLV Kentucky Blend or FLV Native.  \n\nCould make an interesting add-in for a sweeter desert tobacco base, especially as an accent in a caramel heavy RY4.\n\nDarker fruits like figs, blackberries, or realistic blueberries would play well the very light fruitiness here.  Adding something sweeter up again that clove is going to taste fairly medicinal, although if that's your thing the strength of the clove will help mask some of the weirder off-notes from cherries.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Here's the ELR Page.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/67292)  User \"JoJo\" writes: \"6% (SnV - bit of an anise note, sweet, else nothing. 1 week - same.

Liquid barn calls out a vanilla bean, but I'm not getting much in the way of a darker, spicier vanilla.  It's more of a frosting type vanilla.  I'm getting a decent amount of cream as well.  There's quite a bit of volume and some actual buttery notes.  I'm not picking up anything overtly dairy, but it feels a bit like a whipped cream.  The base of the cream is a bit waxy, but it's identifiably a vanilla cream.\n\nThe tobacco underneath that vanilla cream is relatively subtle, but it feels like a mismatch for that creamy vanilla.  The tobacco I get is mostly on the tail end of the exhale, although you start to pick up a bit underneath the beginning of the exhale as well.  It's a relatively bright, mellow kind of tobacco with a little bit of citrus and a relatively prominent hay type grassiness to it.  There's also a a bit of warmth and throat hit in here.  No smoke or ash, feels relatively clean as far as tobaccos go.  Most of the tobaccos paired with vanilla lean more towards a darker, bolder kind of pipe tobacco while this doesn't really have the intensity to keep up the vanilla and that light grassiness doesn't feel like it meshes all that well.\n\nThe Vanilla Cream here brings in a sort of fluffy mouthfeel.  This is relatively sweet as well.  This feels like it may have some of whatever is going on with their sweet pipe tobacco in the base, as it has fluffy sweetness that feels a lot like a heavy dose of FA Oba Oba.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Not a whole lot tobacco, and probably a much lighter tobacco than it actually needs to stand up that vanilla cream.  Cream is a bit waxy.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Moderate.  For as smooth as this should be from the cream, there's a pretty solid harshness here more in line with a tobacco.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 5% I'm mostly getting a light vanilla cream.  Some waxy body down low, but thin in the middle.  I'm not picking much tobacco at all.\n\nAt 9% that vanilla cream fills in quite a bit.  The vanilla picks up and the middle of the flavor feels less thin.  That tobacco component is still fairly light, but it's more present at 9% than 5%.\n\nLiquid Barn suggests mixing this at 9%.  That seems like a good starting point for using this as a vanilla cream base for a tobacco.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Solo, this doesn't really deliver on the vanilla cream tobacco thing.  I'd be using this around that 9% suggested mixing percentage and then adding something substantially darker, like INW Black for Pipe.  Seems like a good jumping off point for making your own vanilla or just generally sweet pipe tobacco flavors.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Here's the ELR Page.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/67287)  User \"JoJo\" writes: \"6% (SnV - definitely getting the creamy vanilla flavor, but not much tobacco. 1 week - Very nice creamy vanilla.

Heavy, rich, and with some serious buttery notes.  Feels pretty rich and full fat.  A heavier base with moderate butter notes and a store brand ice cream middle.  Sweeter cream, without any real prominent funky dairy notes to mess with it.  Liquid barn suggests using this as a custard substitute, but it doesn't really have the heavy eggy notes you'd look for in a custard.\n\nThere's a good deal of vanilla in here.  It's a very bright, commercial type of vanilla instead of a darker, spicier vanilla bean.  It doesn't have much in the way of depth, but it does have a slightly malty kind of note to it like DIYFS Holy Vanilla.  At higher percentages, that malt comes out quite a bit more and gets almost a dry cocoa type of flavor.  The brightness and lack of nuance kind of makes me think of a cheaper ice cream, but it works pretty well for the profile.  I get just the tiniest hit of a black pepper in the top notes for the vanilla, but it's pretty subtle even at the suggested 11%.  It does however seem to get a bit dry that high (at least solo), almost like you've got too much ethyl vanillin going on.\n\nThis has a really nice, thick texture to it.  It's a heavier flavor overall, with a really solid density to the base.  Like most of the liquid barn creams, it feels just a bit thin in the middle, but it's by far the least thin of all their creams I've tried.  It's more just normal thick in the middle compared to that crazy thick base.  Also pretty sweet overall.  Doesn't go full frosting sweet, but it's sort of an un-nuanced sweetness without anything dark to it, just sugary.\n\nI'm a hard, hard black pepper taster with TPA VBIC, this seems to be a fairly effective substitute without the vast majority of the black pepper... at least for me, steeped at relatively high percentages.  I pick up just a bit of a peppery edge to this with extended vaping, but it's nothing close to TPA.  I don't have a ton of VBIC-style experience, but this noticeably richer than FW and CAP.  It's maybe a bit richer down low than TPA, but thinner in the middle and with less of a distinct butter taste.\n\nAlso, this one probably isn't for the Low DAAP crowd.... [it has a truly impressive 35,000ppm Acetyl Propinoyl.](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0307/9897/files/VanillaIceCream_DS.jpg?5513177427726715981)  Hats off, that's almost obscene.  [The component list for TPA's VBIC lists AP as under 3%... so that one is mostly likely between 20,000-30,000 ppm](https://shop.perfumersapprentice.com/componentlist.aspx?sku_search=346849)... so maybe it's not so crazy after all.  That's part of the issue with being a company that actually publishes it's information, it leaves you open for special scrutiny.  So shout out to Liquid Barn for having their DAAP testing publicly available, even if I did literally LOL when I saw that.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Flavor gets just a hair thin in the middle.  Some drier malty, almost black pepper or cocoa, notes up top vaped solo.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light.  The top end of this gets a bit harsh and dry solo, but it's nothing major and the base is smooth.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 6% this is pretty solid.  Vanilla is pretty much on point for a vanilla ice cream, with that bright if slightly cheap tasting fairly one-dimensional vanilla.  Base is already fairly thick but the middle feels just a bit thin.  No real off notes.\n\nAt 11% the middle of this flavor has filled out quite a bit.  The base is downright heavy, and the middle is pretty solid for an ice cream.  Vanilla is starting to go malty and I'm getting just a bit of black pepper here.  Vanilla might actually be a bit too prominent and I'm getting some dryness.\n\nLiquid barn suggests mixing with this at 11%, and honestly it works pretty well up there.  I feel like the top notes get a bit too malty, but nothing chemical or weird.  Just based on these tests, I'd probably be using it around 8% as an ice cream base or around 5% as a cream component in a mix.  Just looking at published recipes, plenty of people are using it lower in the 3-4% range for their bases, and while that could work for some richness I feel like the flavors relatively flat and lacking some of the charm down there.  I don't know... do what you want.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Well, it's a vanilla ice cream, so basically use this in 1 ouf of every 3 published recipes.  Should work well as a TPA VBIC sub for the pepper tasters out there, albeit at about 1.5-2x in terms of percentage.  Use either as an ice cream base, or as a thicker, richer cream element that doesn't taste like a whipped cream.\n\nThe mighty ID10-T has done a lot of futzing with this that I've gotten ahold of through mixer's club, and his trick seems to be mixing this with some HS Ice Cream to fill it out.  Seems to be a pretty good trick to deal with that bit of thinness in the middle.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  This one is pretty darn popular.\n\n[Here's the ELR Page.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/32197)  There is a fair number of notes on there, all fairly positive.

It's a candy spearmint, instead of a really leafy green natural spearmint, but it's not that straight gum spearmint.  It doesn't have that really chalky, powdery kind of wrigleys spearmint vibe and the mentholation is closer to something like an altoid.  It's definitely one the better, more aggressive spearmints I've had.\n\nThe vanilla here is that brighter frosting type vanilla without any of the creamy or waxy type of body that usually comes with those flavors.  It's not really a dominant component in the concentrate, it's more of an accent helping to sweeten and soften the harder edges of the spearmint.  It's doing a lot of what the vanilla in a white tic-tac does.  it complements that more intense spearmint pretty well.\n\nThis has a pretty heavy mentholation to it.  It's pretty heavily cold.  At relatively moderate percentages it's pretty smooth but it can get a bit of that heavy, spicy menthol edge at Liquid Barn's suggested 15%.\n\nThis feels like a spearmint vape, and the texture and sweetness bear that out.  This isn't really candy sweet, but there's enough sweetness to take a bit of the more aggressive edge off the spearmint.  There also isn't much in the way of body.  This concentrates feels closest to something like CAP Cool Mint, but with less of that white tic-tac body and a much stronger mentholation.\n\n**Off-flavors:**Nah.  You've got mint.  You've got vanilla.  Nothing odd.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Moderate, but that's kind of the point with this level of mentholation.\n\n**Percentage testing:** 8% is spearmint forward.  The vanilla kind of lives around the edges here, but it's a nice accent.  Mentholation is solid but not overwhelming.  Nice and cool overall.  Still feels a bit undersaturated, like the flavor isn't quite full.\n\nAt 15%, this is actually a little too mentholated for me.  It's starting to get an almost spicy edge to it.  The flavor underneath works fairly well, but the spearmint is overbearing.\n\nJust based on these tests, the percentage on this is going to pretty subjective.  Liquid Barn suggests 15%, I'd probably be closer to 10%.  Seems like a good balance of chill and actual flavor here.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Good solo flavor if you want something cool but not really astringent.  It's got quite a bit of cooling edge but the vanilla helps to smooth it out and add some interesting contrast.\n\nOutside of a single flavor, you probably want to stick with additions that actually work well with menthol like berries.  Generally avoid anything with overripe notes and anything creamy.  This would also pair well with straight non-aromatic tobaccos but I'd watch the sweetness.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Here's the ELR Page.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/201062)  User \"jojo\" writes: \"SnV - Definitely minty.

Shout out to Liquid Barn*\n\n**Setup:** Recoil w/ flavor barrel, Dual 15 wrap 26g 3mm Nifethal 70 coils @.14 ohms.  60w power, 450F temp limit. Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Liquid Barn Vienna Cream, 3 and 6% @ 1g/ml, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 35 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Pretty middle of the road sweet or whipped cream, with a medium-heavy base and a thinner body.\n\nThe cream here is fairly non-descript. I'm getting a slightly heavier base but it doesn't have the intensely heavy buttery notes that I get from LB Cream and LB Fresh Cream.  The body of the cream of the cream has some actual sweet cream dairy notes.  Seems pretty easygoing, nothing really butryic or cheesy.  Just a hint of something like a fresh-ish heavy cream.  This also seems to have a thinner middle to it, much like the other LB creams.  The contrast between a fuller base and thinner body isn't nearly as stark as those other creams, but it's still there.  At LB's suggested 6% i'm getting some raw vg sweetness poking through the middle of the flavor.\n\nLiquid barn calls out \"the slightest hit of cinnamon\" but I have to really go looking for it.  I can taste something there, but it's very mild and is coming across more as a bit of increased throat hit and maybe a touch of dryness as opposed to a really distinct cinnamon flavor.  It doesn't really translate into a cinnamon top note.  The cinnamon is light enough you could probably just ignore it while mixing, but it's something to watch out for if you're super sensitive to it.\n\nThe texture here is interesting.  It's going more whipped cream for me.  There's a lighter, fluffiness to the flavor.  I'm also getting a weirdly layered effect from that relatively heavier base and the thinner middle.  The contrast isn't as stark as it is with the heavier, waxier LB Cream and LB Fresh Cream, but it's still a bit distracting.  The flavor ends up tasting a bit undersaturated to me at the suggested mixing percentage in the middle, and I think the cinnamon is making it feel relatively harsh and dry for a cream flavor.  A little undersweet for a pastry cream, but probably a touch too sweet for just straight cream.\n\nOut of the Liquid Barn creams this feels the most like an actual cream, instead of a whipped cream.  It's still a bit fluffier and undersaturated than an actual cream flavor, but this has some actual dairy notes to it as opposed to the primarily butter base notes of the other two.  This is also probably the sweetest of the 3, but not by any kind of huge margin.  I think Vienna Cream is supposed to be more of a pastry cream flavor.  Just comparing it FA Vienna Cream, the FA does a better job of hitting that pastry cream profile.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Same thing with the other LB Creams, there's a lack of vibrancy or saturation in the body of the flavor.  That cinnamon thing seems a bit tacked on and limits some usefulness, without actually adding much cinnamon flavor.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light to moderate.  Base of the flavor is smooth, but the actual body of the flavor comes across thin and dry.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 3% I'm not getting much out of this.  Some heavier, slightly buttery dairy notes and a raw vg sweetness.  Fluffy, insubstantial texture overall.\n\nAt 6% the base of this flavor has gotten a bit more filled in, I'm getting more dairy, but the body is still a bit thin.  It's a bit dry, and that cinnamon accent seems to be exacerbating it.\n\nLiquid Barn suggests 6% with this, and that's probably in the ballpark.  Trying it as an S&V at 10%, the dairy notes have started to get a bit sour and unpleasant.  I think you might be able to go up to 8% with a steep, but it's going to stay fairly layered as more of a cream base, rather than full pastry cream flavor.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Not much of a solo flavor.  \n\nIf you are going to be using LB Creams, this comes across the most like an actual cream.  It's the one that you'd have the best luck with trying to work into an cream recipe that needed a bit more than a heavy layer on the bottom.  It still kind of skews that way, but it's not as drastic.  You could definitely still use it for layering like that if you want, and it's probably the closest out of the trio to an actual whipped cream as well.\n\nYou could also use this to hang some cinnamon off of.  Should be an interesting pairing with cinnamon heavy bakeries.\n\nOr just ignore the cinnamon and throw some strawberries in it.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Here's the ELR Page.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/20199)  User \"JoJo\" writes: \"6% (SnV - semi-sweet, light cream flavor. 1 week - same. 2 weeks - same. 3 weeks - same.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Liquid Barn White Chocolate Peppermint, 6 and 12%  @ 1g/ml, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 30 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Peppermint bark coffee syrup.  Most of the flavor is there but I'm having some texture and balance issues solo.\n\nThis leads with peppermint. Fit for the profile, but it's a sweeter peppermint base, pretty much on point for a candy cane or starlight mint.  Doesn't quite seem to have the body of something like CAP Peppermint or FW Candy Cane, but the same kind of peppermint.  Mentholation here is relatively high for a candy peppermint, but the sweetness keeps pretty tight to profile.\n\nWhite chocolate accent here, especially at lower percentages before it really gets through that cooling. Feels a bit crumbly and waxy instead of creamy and smooth, sort of hershey's grade white chocolate.  Solid, warm white chocolate base but the middle of the flavor feels a bit thin against the cooling.  A hint of an oreo type of cookie in here as well, feels like maybe just a bit of actual cocoa snuck in somehow.  Maybe a bit thinner and less rich than FW White Chocolate, but it has 0 of that weird pepper thing I usually get from TPA White Chocolate.\n\nRelatively sweet flavor overall, but it works well with the profile.  A little sticky, with a bit of sugar lips.  No real coil or wick gore, seems to vape fairly clean.  The biggest thing pulling it away from a peppermint bark for me is the lack of texture right in the middle of the flavor.  Heavier white chocolate base, and all sorts of peppermint in the top notes... but it just feels a bit thin.  I'm not sure if it's just that relatively heavy cooling thinning it out, or the way the flavor was built, but it feels like it could use some help in filling it out.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Nothing off in terms of actual flavor.  Missing some texture for how aggressive these flavors come across.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  I'm actually getting a bit of throat hit from this.  It's not so much a classic sting beyond the bite from the peppermint, but it's a bit hard for me to really inhale deeply without some coughing.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  6% is peppermint heavy.  I'm getting a candy cane type peppermint up front with a bit of heavier white chocolate on the exhale.  Mentholation feels a bit sharp.  Sweet, but not cloying.  Not a whole lot of body.\n\n12% is even heavier on the peppermint, but more of that white chocolate shows up underneath.  Peppermint is aggressively cool and feels a bit sharper than a candy cane flavor. White chocolate is heavy and a bit waxy.  Still feels a bit thin in the middle.\n\nLiquid Barn suggests 12% for this, but that seems a bit much.  6% feels like it misses out with some of the white chocolate, but 12% is too cool and a bit harsh.  The second opinions call out 8% as the point where the white chocolate shows up, and that seems like a safe bet for a solo or primary flavor in a mix.\nThis should work well as an accent flavor around 3-4%, especially with creams or chocolates in the mix to pick up some of that white chocolate.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Fairly solid as a solo flavor.\n\nOutside of that, you're not really going to get away from the white chocolate or peppermint here, so you'll need a profile that will handle both.\n\n[Looking at the available ATF recipes](https://alltheflavors.com/flavors/liquid-barn-white-chocolate-peppermint?original=true&owner=all&sort_order=new&suggestions=0), you see [Jr. Mints](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/42828#mints_jr_by_hayden5757), [Thin Mints](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/42828#mints_jr_by_hayden5757), [Peppermint Bark](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/45725#white_chocolate_peppermint_bark_by_bradh), [Cookies](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/51359#w_c_peppermintington_cookies_by_fear), [Ice Cream](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/51253#wcp_ice_cream_by_fear), and [some](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/44162#little_white_girls_by_skiddlzninja) [coffee](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/72486#peppermint_mocha_challange_dmc_007_by_shakenvape007) [recipes.](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/73901#jolly_java_by_dezy)  Seems about right.  This is mostly going to be working with chocolates, vanillas, bakeries, more mints, creams, and coffees.  Either the white chocolate or the peppermint is likely to clash in other profiles.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Here's the ELR Page.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/152771)  Users \"Lulzor\" and \"Chachi Vapes\" both have a copy, so no idea where it came from, but they write: \"This is a brilliant flavor, although its uses are a bit limited. Very accurate and very tasty as a single flavor mix. The white chocolate part starts to materialize above 8%.  5% is too weak, 8% is too weak. 12% may also be too weak for your tastes. try 10-15%. in a mix it should be overpowered. mix around 6-8% depending on where it sits in your recipe.  the white chocolate comes through well but is heavily masked by the peppermint. The white chocolate reminds me of a ghirardelli candy rather than that thick bark you'd get around holidays. the peppermint is very starlight candy-like and very much on the front end.It's creamy but not particularly thick.\"\n\nThis made the youtube rounds.

I've never had rainbow sherbet that wasn't ice cold before, so perhaps that's throwing me for a loop, but I feel like this is missing something (nothing a little koolada wouldn't fix.) The fruitiness is blended so that no flavor really jumps out to the front, just like my experience with actual sherbet. \nThere is a mild creaminess in the background that reminds me that this is an ice cream flavor, but it in no way detracts from the accuracy or balance here. This seems a tiny bit less concentrated than the other LNW flavors, but it may come out better after a longer steep.

Typically, that's a bad thing, but in this case it was a very positive experience.\n\nThe flavor here has nothing to do with licorice - not in the sense of anise or salmiak at least. It does have tones of it, kinda like VT Fig, but the flavor for this one is almost a spot on spiced prune.\n\nIt does lack some throat hit and that spice is hard to detect what is - but it's there.\n\nThe spice comes with some smoked notes as well plus it has a very delightful round texture.\n\nu/isuamadog said and I quote: \"almost smoked, like you took a prune and toasted it on the grill\".\n\nWhat makes this one really unique is the almost jelly-ish body it has. It's sweet, but not sweet as a candy - natural sweetness would be the correct term.\n\nPairings for this would definitely be bakeries and tobaccos and definitely with other licorice flavors as well - such as FA Black Touch.\n\nCan also be used with darker fruits - but should probably be kept away from the more brighter fruits.\n\nIn a mix, this can probably be used anywhere from 0.25-1%.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**MB Anise Star**:\n\nStarted this at 1% and before we even tried it, we noticed it had a very weak smell.\n\nBased on that, we already from the begining bumped it up to 1.5%.\n\nNo licorice flavor this one at all. What we could detect was what the label says - Anise star spice. But also comes with extra added sweetness, that kinda made it a little weird.\n\nWe agreed, that this flavor is what FLV Root Beer is missing.\n\nAfter that, we found our big boy pants and bumped it up to 3% just to see what would happen.\n\nSurprisingly little actually. Not much changed in the flavor, with the exception that a minor of the sweetness went away and the anise appeared a little brighter. Although, the anise was also accompanied by a terrible off-note of a metallic taste which was not pleasant at all.\n\nThat combined gives you a super weird after-taste, that doesn't really sit well with anything.\n\nPairings for this would again be beverages or teas. There are nothing about this flavor that we can see being used for anything but those.\n\nKeep it low in a mix - 0.25-0.5%.\n\nThis was by far our least likeable of the tests we did.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**FA Anise**:\n\nStarting off at 1% as per usual by now.\n\nThe smell of this - ooooh snap, it's delicious! It's a straight up anise as promised, but it also comes with an incredible good tasting under-note that almost has a \"saltiness\" to it.\n\nEven at 1%, this packs a punch of flavor - so the category here is your typical FA flavor that works brilliant in lower percentages.\n\nThe notes in this are sharp and adds edge, but not in an uncomfortable way. This would have the ability to bend a mix and make it different.\n\nIt's rich and full in flavor, but it also stops in flavor quickly - meaning, the flavor is there and the next second, it gone again. This is one of those flavors that could work very well with CAP Licorice, as it does add what the CAP Licorice tend to be missing to make it a pure full licorice.\n\nThe background notes it comes with is very similiar to those notes you'd find in your typical Scandinavian licorice candy, which is very good.\n\nSweet, salty and full - in that order. And it brings that very delicious \"zing\" that makes flavors really pop.\n\nParings for this one is a bit of a broad term. It can work very well in candies, but also in spiced and floral mixes, beverages, tobaccos - maybe not so much in bakeries, but I'm sure someone will make that work too. All around, we can almost see this work with anything - except bright fruits, no!\n\nIn a mix it's a 0.3-0.5% type - higher than that and it would take over and bully anything you'd pair it with.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TFA Absinthe**:\n\nWe'll be honest with you. This one terrified us before we even started, but none the less; big boy pants out and on and we hit it straight off at 5%.\n\nTo start out, the smell of this is straight up absinthe - no more, no less.Taste-wise, we have probably never come across a single flavor that had this many nuances as TFA Absinthe does. One moment it's sweet, the next it gets weird and finally it bitter and delicious. All three stages lingers in your mouth at the same time at the end.\n\nWeird taste, but so seriously delicious.\n\nAs many other salmiak based (and I do believe this is salmiak based, not anise), TFA Absinthe comes with a tongue-numbing \"zing\" to it. Some like it, some don't. For u/isuamadog and I it's a win.\n\nThe sweetness this flavor comes with is very welcoming and it does blend in well with the salmiak the licorice in it comes with.\n\nParings for this one would be booze, as it does lack the boozy vibe to it. Maybe some whiskey or gin - whatever booze floats your boat and does it for you.\n\nThere are a good amount of recipes on ATF for this one, ranging everywhere from candy to beverages, hell even a fruit mixture as well.\n\nIn a mix, this would probably do its best around 2-3%.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat was pretty much what we had for you. We apologize, that we didn't add in the hardware used, but there were two of us after all. We do hope, that someone will find this information useful, should they want to jump into a darker rabbit hole.\n\n[**DIY\\_eJuice Flavor Reviews**](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)",

It has a bit of a cereal type note to it, not an oat, just plain cereal. The cereal or crispy note kind of reminds me of FA cookie mixed really low. The raspberry mixed with the strawberry is a perfect combination. The strawberry is a nice sweet juicy strawberry flavor, its somewhat candy like. The raspberry is in there lingering and mixing together with the strawberry to almost give it a jammy type feel. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI could see adding some more cereal and/or cookie to this to make it seem more like a honey nut cheerio cereal with berries. Overall this has been a very enjoyable vape. I let a friend of mine try it who is really sensitive to honey flavors and she loved it. A lot of honey flavors tend to have that cat pee aroma but this one passed the test and does not have that at all. My tester mixed at 4% seemed perfect.",

Sweet caramel is still there but unfortunately that musky/butyric acid like note was also still there. \n\n\nWeek 2-3\nThere was no change in flavor from week one testing. The muskiness did seem to be dialed back alittle or maybe i was just getting accustomed to it. \n\n\nMy thoughts: \nI can not see mixing this solo any higher then 4% the musky butyric acid note would take over the flavor. The caramel note in it is great. Sweetness & creaminess level are both good. Just have that strange musky off note to contend with. Although it seems to be easily covered up when mixed with other flavors. \n\n\nSuggested mixing %:\n.5-2% if pushed any higher the muskiness will be harder to cover up in the mix. \n\n\nSuggested pairings:\nCreams,tobaccos,apples,bananas,bakeries,candies, or with another caramel. \n\n\nI would rate this 3.5/5 \n\n\nRecipe is used this in used it at 1.5% and it worked very well in there. \n\nhttps://alltheflavors.com/recipes/73521#cinnamon_banana_nut_ry4_by_enyawreklaw",

I'm vaping this on a Pulse RDA 0.25ohms 45 watts NI and KA single fused clapton. This one is a little light at this percentage. The raspberry is really nice and sweet. Its not overbearing or floral at all. The soda is nice and sweet with some minor vanilla notes to it. The apricot is a nice touch and for me it lingers in the background. Its different but I really like it. I'm not one to pick apricot out at a flavor but it really does something with this mix. Its a nice sweet flavor that almost reminds me of a peach but its a tad more tart than a peach. I think the apricot adds to the sweetness of this flavor. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI will likely finish this 15ml tester up and mix this again at 6%.

It still has that sweet sort peach taste to it. The raspberry seems to be more in the background. The raspberry is still the same with no off notes. It is just a nice sweet raspberry taste. This flavor like this almost reminds me of a gummy bear. It has great mouthfeel to it. I have already gone through 10mls of this juice on the Pulse RDA! \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen I mixed this at 4% I gave it 4 out of 5 stars. Now that I mixed it at 6% I gave it 5 out of 5 stars!",

I'm vaping this on a Pulse RDA 0.25ohms 45 watts NI and KA single fused clapton. This is an excellent raspberry flavor that taste like its dipped in honey and covered with white chocolate. The raspberry and the honey flavors mixed at this percentage have no floral notes at all. Its a nice sweet and juicy raspberry flavor. The white chocolate is in the background to me but its there. Its a nice white chocolate flavor with light cocoa under tones. This is probably one of the best honey flavors I have tried to date. Most of the other honey flavors I have tried have had an offensive taste to it but this one does not. As far as the chili note I really didn't notice it until I dripped the juice on my hand and tasted it. Yep there it is. To me the chili/spicy flavor in here was almost unnoticed until I read the description. There is nothing fowl about the spicy note. It actually compliments the mix quite well! \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm kind of unsure as to using this at 6-7% because it seems perfect at 4%. I have already gone through 15ml's of this. Next time I mix this I will try it at 6%. I can honestly say this is a one shot. I don't really feel like this mix needs anything added to it. I guess if I wanted to add something to this I would maybe consider adding a blueberry, forest fruit, or black currant to give it more of a mixed berry flavor. Other than that I feel like for the description its dead on.  ",

    "markdown": "**Testing:** Medicine Flower Black Cherry standalone, 80VG/20PG at 1%, 1.5% and 2%.\n\n\n**Setup:** sxk hadaly clone, fused clapton 26x2/34 SS 316L, 6 wraps, cotton wicks. \n\n\n**Flavor description:** Accurate, semi candyish, dark cherry. Up front I get dark mostly natural cherry with almost a slight dark skinned plum note to it. Reminds me of plum peels. This is like a Luden's cough drop cherry but darker and not as sweet, or a black cherry Kool-aid at higher percentages.\n\n\nIt also has a cherry pectin kind of tang and bit of juiciness on the back of the tongue after the exhale. That juiciness increases with percentage and starts to become a little tiny bit harsh. \n\n\nAt 1% it's not so candyish and a bit more natural. The candy kicks in at 1.5% for me. At 2% it starts to get little mediciney with the harshness building. \n\n\n**Off flavors:** No real off flavors here, just a little bit of harshness and mediciney flavor at high percentages. \n\n\n**Throat hit:** Non existent at 1%. Mild at 2% and should grow from there. \n\n\n**Pairings:** This would be great with another more natural cherry to bring out the dark jammy notes for a bakery. This also may pair well with plum and blackcurrant in a dark fruit vape. It's a nice sweet topper to a tart lemonade as well. My next trial will be to pair it with pipe tobaccos. I imagine it will work well with creams and yogurts too. \n\n\n**Quick recipe:**\n\n1% MF Black Cherry\n\n4% LA Lemonade\n\n1% TFA Strawberry Ripe\n\n\n**Conclusion:** It's a really nice dark cherry that avoids most of the medicine flavor you normally get from cherry profiles and should be pretty versatile. Even though this concentrate is difficult to work with and takes a while to steep, it mixed well with the PG based fruit concentrates I threw at it and made a tasty vape. I'm interested how it may do with creams and bakeries as well. \n\n\n**Second opinions:** Not much on ELR, 3-4 recipes with the obvious pairings I've mentioned. No notes.\n\n\nOne review on [ECX] (http://staging.ecigexpress.com/diy-e-liquid/diy-e-liquid-flavors/lotus-flavors/black-cherry-flavor-by-lotus-flavors.html) that confirms its not as harsh as other black cherry flavors.\n\n\n\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**\n\n\nEDIT added flavor reviews wiki link.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Nature's Flavors Ginger, 1% and 3%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 30 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Just ginger, moderately sweetened.\n\nAggressive ginger flavor.  Nothing else really going on here.  Its a bold, spicy,accurate ginger.  Doesn't feel dryer like a bakery ginger, and it's not a mellow ginger ale type flavor.  Really light earthiness, but it adds to the accuracy.\n\nSolid body to this.  Thick enough to avoid going astringent or thin, but nothing creamy or candied in the texture.  It's sweetened a bit off a raw ginger profile, but it isn't too cloying.  Solo, tastes maybe a bit more like a ginger candy, but not sweet enough to pull an entire mix that way.\n\nThe available gingers are probably more alike than similar, but this might be the truest to something like a raw ginger, even with the sweetness.  It's less dry than HS, spicier than FLV, and more vibrant and brighter than FW.  Overall not a bad choice if you were going to pick up one ginger, aside from availability.\n\n**Off-Flavors:**  Sweeter than eating actual raw ginger, but otherwise nothing.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Yeah, but it's ginger.  Pretty accurate spice to it.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 1%, this is still pretty intense. Lightly sweet, fairly spicy.  Just tastes like ginger.\n\nAt 3%, this isn't really that much spicier.  I mean, at least not 3 times as spicy.  A bit bit more body, and a good deal more sweetness.  Fairly harsh, but that's the point.\n\nI've also tried this in a couple of mixes at lower percentages and it seems to work pretty well.  I'd say suggested percentage is entirely up to how much ginger you want.  Noticeable as low as .25% in a mix, but vapeable up to at least 3% if you're really into ginger.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Pretty standard ginger, so all of those profiles basically.\n\nNot just a bakery ginger, but should work fine in bakeries at a lower percentage an an accent.  I'd start at .25% and work up.  Should probably stay in that accent role at lower percentages with creams, fruit mixes, and tobaccos.\n\nI'd bump it up to around 1% for beverage type profiles like adding some spice to cocktails.\n\nFor a primary flavor, I'd just lean into the ginger and mix around 2%.\n\n**Second Opinions:** [Another day, another HIC review on BCF.](https://www.bullcityflavors.com/ginger-nf/#product-reviews)  They write: \"This is one of the very best flavorings you'll ever find, regardless of brand. In my opinion, it's NF's very best. By itself it tastes like crushed gingerroot. As a sub-1% addition to other spice flavors, it gives you a bakery-type ginger flavor. Add caramel/butterscotch for ginger syrup. With creative mixing, it can taste like crystallized ginger, ginger ale, or any other ginger-type flavor you can imagine. No other ginger flavoring is as realistic or as versatile as this one.\"\n\nThere's a ton of slightly vintage posts advocating for this, but no actual descriptions, besides HIC telling people to buy it.\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

    "markdown": "**Setup:** Recoil w/ flavor barrel, Dual 12 wrap 24g 3.5mm SS316 @.33 ohms. 60w power, 450F temp limit. Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Nature's Flavors Malt, 1% and 3%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 29 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**\n\nSeems to be more of a malt syrup.  Nothing really bready or beer-y to this.  I do get a really light nuttiness and some moderate warmth, but no really aggressive malt liquor type taste.  The sweetness here seems like something between a soft caramel and fake maple \"pancake\" syrup. The maltiness is pretty subtle, tastes more like a softer vanilla. Reminds me of the malty parts of Lorann's Cream Cheese Icing or DIYFS Holy Vanilla.  Lighter caramelization, nothing burnt or too crispy.\n\nMouthfeel and sweetness level here is definitely syrupy.  Despite the softer caramel notes, no chewy caramel body or any of the associated cardboard taste that usually comes with that.  Moderately dense overall, but the finish seems to get a bit watery.   Intense sweetness, even at low percentages.  I've vaped quite a bit of this solo, and I'm not really noticing my wicks getting crispy or any coil gunking.  Seems suspiciously easy on the coils for something this sweet.\n\nComparing this to FW Malt, the NF version is a whole lot more pleasant.  FW Malt is sort of green, more aggressively funky, and much less sweet.  This doesn't have anything earthy or vegetal and is much sweeter and smoother. I'll be interested to see how this compares to Vape Train Golden Syrup.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  None that I can find.  I mean, it's not an aggressive malt so if you're looking for powdered steel reserve look somewhere else.  Nothing chemical or off-profile.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Not really, seems pretty smooth overall.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 1%, this is still really sweet overall. Lighter caramel notes, nothing off or weird.  Manages to taste heavily sweet without being cloying.\n\nAt 3% this is getting maybe too sweet.  Caramel starts to feel a little dark. Starting to get some weird vanilla notes. Not really unpleasant but pretty intense.\n\nJust based on these tests, this is definitely an accent flavor.  I'd use it primarily as a sweetener with some bonus malt and caramel.  I'd probably start lower at .5% for a lighter sweetness and top out around 2%.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I think this has some real potential in fixing a couple of problems I've had with recipes.  This seems a lot like some of the slightly more robust sweeteners like sorghum, agave, \"maple\" syrup, or even honey. I think it'd make a good take on agave with fruit profiles and sorghum with bakery profiles pretty much as is.  I've traditionally tried hack FW Butterscotch Ripple into the body of a pancake syrup or a honey, I think this would do a better job.  The flavor is a little more neutral and subtle than the ripple.  You could use a lower percentage of a stronger maple or honey flavor as the top notes and let this fill in the syrupy body.\n\nAlso seems like a good bakery sweetener.  Good way to get sweetness into a mix without some of that heavy sucralose mouthfeel and dryness.  Might be a bit dark for fruits without a bakery component, but should pretty well disappear in heavier bakeries.\n\nAnd you could probably use this to get closer to malted milk or ovaltine.  Not really malty enough for a strong candy malt, but adding some of this to a cream would move you a bit closer to a sweetened, slightly nutty malted flavor.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  [We've got a HIC sighting in the Bull City product page reviews.](https://www.bullcityflavors.com/malt-nf/#product-reviews)  5-star review: \"The flavor of barley malt - which is a very common sweetener in packaged sweets (also the major ingredient in Ovaltine plain malt powder). Read ingredient lists for sweet stuff in your cupboard to get ideas for DIYing with Barley Malt. Just 0.5% will sweeten a recipe; more adds barley malt flavor. Extremely versatile and belongs in your flavor collection if you're a DIYer who likes sweets, especially sweet bakery flavors.\"\n\nThere are a couple of older ECF threads about this flavor.  [In the first,](https://www.e-cigarette-forum.com/threads/nf-malt-flavor-concentrate.457270/) OP was expecting beer and got caramel.  Was less than psyched.  [In the second,](https://www.e-cigarette-forum.com/threads/natures-flavors-malt.441781/) OP's asking about malted milk and then gets suggestions to use this with tobacco and peanut butter.\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**\n",

    "markdown": "**NN Strawberry Raspberry Rhubarb Pie Filling**  \n*Summary*  \nSo I'll start by saying I'm a little disappointed with this flavor, especially as someone who is a bit of a Nude Nicotine Fanboi. The biggest thing I'm sensing from this is some strange berry mix that is reminiscent of medicine. I can see where they might be saying rhubarb, as there is just the slightest hint of that tart freshness from the rhubarb, but it's completely overwhelmed by the off-putting berry mix, somewhat similar to their Very Berry concentrate. It is kind of thick and jammy, which is nice and I could see that aspect being useful.  \n\nI tried this at 3%, since most of their flavorings are good in a range of 2-7% (I've found 5-6 to be the sweet spot for most of them). Overall it just kind of misses the mark, has an off-putting medicinal flavor, and I don't see using this when there are a ton of great concentrates in all of the categories they were going for that we can use in its place. If this was all I had to vape, I could get through it and wouldn't be inclined to end my life; it's *not that bad*, but I'm completely let down from the notion of a \"Strawberry Raspberry Rhubarb Pie Filling\".  \n\n\n**On the Nose**  \nMedicinal Berries\n\n**Usage**   \n*Stand alone*: 3-5%. If you are so inclined, or have this flavoring and want to experiment, it might benefit from bringing it lower\n\n*In a mix*: 1-2%. Who knows, maybe someone will find a use for it.\n\n**Throat**  \nSmooth\n\n**Pairings**  \nOther Raspberries, Strawberries, or Rhubarb to bring it to a better place; pie crust, biscuits, brown sugar, sweeteners.  \n\n**Avoid**  \nUm... this flavoring? IDK, Coffees, Caramels, heavy creams, things like that.   \n\n**Steep**  \nI didn't notice much change from 1 day to 1 week. The medicinal aspect did calm down after a steep and I was able to sense what I think is the rhubarb they were going for.\n\n**Testing Notes**  \n6/3  \nshake-n-vape  \nSo far --- disappointing. Tastes medicinal like other NN berries unfortunately. Will let it steep and come back to it. not getting any rhubarb or strawberry, just kind of a medicinal raspberry taste. \n\n6/11  \nThe medicinal aspect has calmed down quite a bit. I sense what I think might be the rhubarb they were going for, but it's so muddled from the berries that it's hard to pick up. ",

Well we can all thank /u/ID10-T for blackmailing me into this.\n\nRight off the first pull I get a burnt flavor that slightly resembles a breading flavor, but I have to stretch my imagination out quite a bit. It's rather quite disgusting to be honest. This doesn't remind me of fried chicken at all. It tastes like the burning underlings of the stuff on the bottom of your shoe. I'm not getting any bready notes at all. There is a slight basil flavor i'm getting from this but it's more of a rubbed the basil leaves in dirt and ate it kind of flavor. I'm not getting any chicken flavor from this at all. I'm not sure who made this and said \"yeah, that's fried chicken\" but they were wrong. The only thing I'm really getting from this is the flavor of not changing your wick for a month and vaping on it. I'm not sure how many more words I need to type out to tell you that this flavor is what getting disowned by your parents feels like. RF Fried Chicken was funny to vape; this is some sort of cruel joke that you wouldn't even let your worst enemy vape this trash.\n\n**Off Flavors**: Everything about this? The burnt flavor this gives off the so off putting that this is useless for vaping.\n\n**Throat Hit**: All things considered this a smooth disgusting vape.\n\n**Uses / Why?**: My advice for pairings would be not to use this at all. As much as I didn't like RF Fried Chicken they did this flavor a hell of a lot better than this abortion of a flavor did. RF's version had relatable flavors that you could say were fried chicken at least. I would personally pull out $5.99 and throw it in the trash and burn it. Then you'll have a close aroma to OoO Fried Chicken.\n\n**Second Opinions**: I was only able to find one review for this flavor and they made biscuits with them. Which is probably a better idea.\n\n> This flavor was delicious with the home baked biscuits I made for our Sunday family brunch. I made over 3 dozen that were gone by the end of the meal.",

    "markdown": "I’ve had this concentrate for a while. I originally got this along with a few other meat concentrates from OoO to experiment with adding them to tobacco recipes for the missing smoky/savory elements from combusted tobacco. However, less than 24 hours after receiving the package and leaving it on a table in my office, the house started smelling like I’d stashed a corpse under the floorboards. I traced that smell to the OoO package, and promptly exiled it to the garage.\n\nIt took a couple months, maybe 3, for the garage to stop smelling like an Union Carbide plant died of cancer. More accurately, the smell subsided enough for me to approach the package without Level 4 PPE and determine that the culprit was the bottle of OoO Beef. That shit went into the trash, and the rest of the concentrates went back onto my flavor rack. If you were wondering why convoys of Superfund trucks were coming in and out of the local landfill for several weeks last year, now you know. OoO Beef, not even once.\n\nSo, Smoky Bacon. “Good God, Greybush, are you mad?”, you ask. Sort of, but that’s beside the point. I’ve been messing with DIY tobaccos for a while, and I was attempting a “like for like” approach to recreating the pouch aroma of a freshly opened thing of Drum rolling tobacco. One of the relatable elements from that was a similar sort of savory/smoked element that was a lot like the smell of beef jerky, but more subtle and less overtly meaty. That’s what got me to start hunting down smoked/salty meat concentrates, I was gonna test using them in small doses as casing/saucing additives to the base leaf flavors.\n\nI didn’t get around to actually trying this until recently, partly from being traumatized by the OoO Beef fiasco, and partly because I’d forgotten about it. Here we go!\n\n**Mixing details**: around 70VG/30PG, 12mg/mL nicotine, 10mL testers.\n\n**Device used:** QP Gata in MTL mode, 2.5mm ID 1 ohm 26 gauge KA1 coil, at 15-25 watts. Steeped and tasted over the course of a week.\n\nThe suggested percentages from OoO was a range from 1% to 3%, so I started at the high end and then went low.\n\n**3%:** The tragic aftermath of a grease fire gone out of control.\n\n**1.5%:** Burnt bacon bits embedded in black frying pan sludge.\n\n**1%:** ::lights a Snausage and takes a deep drag::\n\n**0.75%:** Intense bacon grease and liquid smoke. After about a week, it sort of calms down to a heavy wood smoke with some lingering bacon grease.\n\n0.25-0.5% max seems to be where it’s at for an additive, especially when paired with DNB in equal proportion. I can’t really imagine vaping this flavor solo, and as a support flavor, it’s potent enough to overshadow anything else at the recommended 1%-3% percentages.\n\n**Suggested pairings:** Use in tiny doses to add a bit of smoked/pan fried character to other food flavors maybe? I’m thinking as an alternative to FA Black Fire if you’re one of these people who get charred bell peppers from it instead of hickory smoke. Drier tobaccos that are more nutty/woody work. FLV Red Burley, Kentucky Blend, FA 7Leaves Ultimate, that kind of stuff. Avoid sweet tobaccos, you end up with more of a barbecue sauce flavor, especially if you go overboard on something like FLV Native Tobacco or FLV Connecticut Shade.\n\n**Additional notes:** Use sparingly, add to taste. Too much and all you’ll pick up is smoky bacon grease. Not a replacement for DNB, but complements it. Plays decent with FA Oak Wood as well.",

Not one of those deluxe waffle cones you have to pay extra for, this is the cheap, thin vanilla wafer like cone. Not to say it isn't delicious. It is like part sugar cookie (though not as heavy as cap sugar cookie) and part vanilla wafer (though not as dry or buttery as inw biscuit).

It adds just a slight sweetness and bakery to accent your best ice cream recipe. I can't see this being used in any other bakeries because there are other flavors that do that better.\n\n\n**Notes:**\nAt 2% I get a nice strong flavor with no off notes. I can see this being pushed to 3 or 4% if you want it to be more of a main note, but for me to be used as a sugar cone, I would stick to this percentage. \n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nThere really isn't much out there for this flavor.\n\n[deweysuds uses this in his pecan roll](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/23230#rollin_by_deweysuds)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**\n\nIf you have different opinions on the flavor or any ideas on how to use it please post them in the comments.

It's definitely not a true fruit flavor but more of a candy flavor with out much sweetness or tartness. It gets sweeter after steeping but as a shake and vape it has a pretty nice candyish blue raspberry. More like an off-Brand blue raspberry candy just a bit bland even at 15%. Any higher it starts to taste a bit funny.\n\nOff flavors- there's not a real noticeable off flavor but at high percentages and has the ever so slightest soapy chemical taste, but not enough to not make it a great flavor \n\nThroat hit- 4/10 it's a very smooth vape. May be because it's 66% VG but even at 70/30 6mg it's very smooth but with a minimal throat hit compared to other juices.\n\nPairings: this flavor is excellent with sour around 3% Sweetner 2% and sometimes I'll had 1% - 1.5% hard candy. A few others that go really well is Blue raspberry FW at around 3% even though the FW isn't good by itself, it adds a bit of the missing part of OSDIY blue raspberry. Strawberry Ripe 4% and peach 3% add a tremendously delicious twist to it while adding sweetness and a natural fruit flavor.\n\nNotes- overall this is probably the best Blue raspberry concentrate on the market. It has a lot of uses and just about any fruit flavor pairs well with it. If you're a fruit or candy lover like me and haven't tried this out, you definitely should. If it had more of a hard candy with a more tart and sweet flavor this would be perfect, though we can always add those :) next blue raspberry on my list is sour blue raspberry candy from wonder flavours. I've heard good reviews on it, just waiting for gremlin to get their shipment of them. Thanks for reading I hope this helped someone wanting a blue raspberry flavor \n\nSecond opinions- https://m.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/4zizno/first_time_buying_from_osdiy_review/?ref=search_posts",

    "markdown": "**Setup:** Recoil w/ flavor barrel, Dual 15 wrap 26g 3mm Nifethal 70 coils @.15 ohms.  60w power, 450F temp limit. Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** OSDIY Choco-Yum Cake @ 4% and 8%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 14 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Yeah, it's pretty much chocolate cake.  Somewhere between box-mix cake and a hostess ding-dong without a cream filling.  Strange bit of fruitiness and a bit of medicinal note in the middle of this, but it's actually pretty solid. A little hard to vape solo, seems to have some chest tightness attached. Needs around 8% to really come together, and I'd use it as a primary flavor and accent around it.  Decently strong chocolate flavor but doesn't appear to have an excessive amount of wick or coil gore attached.\n\nInhale is kind of like inhaling duncan-hines style box chocolate cake mix, although not quite as dry as that would imply.  Still on the dry side, but only kind of chalky. Really flat milk chocolate, without too much in the way of cocoa. Medium sweetness, pretty on point for a boxed cake. Exhale has that chocolate cake up front. Not a great chocolate cake, but still recognizable. Kind of like that same boxed cake mix cake, or maybe the inside of a hostess ding-dong or something like that. Just a little of recognizable \"cake batter\" type of taste, but with a fluffier mouthfeel. I'm not really tasting too much grain, but the fluffiness brings it away from straight batter. In the middle of the exhale I pick up some weirder fruitiness. I'd say it's maybe cherry? It's pretty non-descript although it has a bit of the same kind of medicinal notes that cherry concentrates have. Tail end of the exhale has some waxy chocolate frosting. Again, a lot like hostess products here, or similar to the glaze on a chocolate frosted donut.  Not a lot of harshness, but it does seem to tighten up my chest a bit. I have to acclimate a bit before I'm really comfortable vaping this.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  So there's that errant fruitiness, and a little bit of medicinal note. FWIW, that medicinal note seems to get more prominent as you push past 10%. \n \n**Throat Hit:**  Not really, but a bit of chest tightness, at least initially.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I think whatever weird fruitiness I'm tasting here could be amped up a bit for a fruit filling in a chocolate cake. If you don't violently hate cherry concentrates, seems like an obvious pairing.  Should work pretty well with a jammier raspberry as well.\n\nIf you wanted to go full ding-dong, some CAP Buttercream for just a bit of extra wax and maybe a touch of whipped cream for the filling. You could probably get away with a bit of HS Australian Chocolate or maybe FLV Milk chocolate to bring a bit more chocolate to the party.\n\nI think mixing this with a donut flavor would get you pretty close to a chocolate cake donut.  If you went full CAP Chocolate Glazed Donut, it should read like a chocolate donut with a chocolate glaze.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, this is a fairly weak flavor.  Chef's recommends 10%, and that seems like fairly good advice. 4% doesn't really come together for me. Some dry cake mix, but not a whole lot else. 6% is a little better. Starting to fill in a bit on the cake texture side, and I'm getting a tiny bit of richness from it. More like smelling the wrapper of a ding-dong. 8% is pretty solid. Good chocolate note, about as much body as you're going to get with this, wax is still pretty mellow and complimentarty at the end. 10% is a little more aggressive, I'm getting more of that fruit flavor and more whatever weird medicinal note is sitting in there.  Chocolate doesn't seem much richer, but maybe it's a bit more present. 12 is feeling like a little much. Fairly hard to vape this high, and that medicinal note is getting bitter. I'd probably stay around 8% for this, and accent around it.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nPretty darn sparse.\n\n[/u/flat4gt30 doesn't mince words: \"Choco yum cake is atrocious, I think they ordered too many of a particular set of flavors and in order to get rid of the extra, they mixed something that could fool a novice DIYer as a full flavor. If you came into the game after the bronuts craze this flavor will make you sad, its not you, its the flavor.

It's already pretty good. I imagine it's going to get even better and richer with a little bit of a steep. But I doubt its going to need long though. Of all the OSDIY flavours I've tried I've noticed they've all been great as SNVs. \n\nI don't have a lot of experience with coffee flavours. When I first started vaping I had a thoroughly unpleasant commercial eliquid that was apparently a hazelnut coffee. It put me off coffee vapes for a long time. But I do really like OSDIY Lotta Latte. It is basically a one shot. It reminds me of a frappuccino from Starbucks, without the cooling. Although i think a little cooling would work really nicely if you wanted to take it that way. The caramel note is really lovely. It's like gooey caramel sauce has been mixed into a creamy coffee. I'm pretty sure there is some sucralose that is probably helping the caramel out. Overall it's pretty sweet, something to bare in mind when mixing with it. Although it's not overly sweet. I get a bit of the sugar lips sweetness on the end especially. The coffee note is nice. It's not too in your face, but still very much present. Not at all skunky or burnt. The balance of the cream, caramel and coffee is really nice. There's not one element that's a lot more prominent than another. It tastes like the coffee, cream and caramel have been blended together and poured into a cup.\n\n\n**Mouthfeel/ Texture:** creamy, good gooey texture from the caramel.\n\n\n**Off Notes:** none. None of the usual off notes associated with coffee, not skunky or burnt tasting.\n\n\n**Throat Hit:** none, very smooth and creamy.\n\n\n**% Testing:** the recommended % according to diy-ejuice.com is 8-15% as a SF and 3-8% in a mix. I'd say this is probably about right. 10% was pretty flavourful and saturated, but if i was going to vape it as a SF I'd probably increase the % a bit - maybe 12-15%? I do like my vapes on the bolder end of the spectrum though.\n\n\n**Use and Pairings:** it's pretty much a one shot and I could vape it as a SF. But it would be easy to add a few other flavours for a more interesting mix. It's definitely something a recipe could be built around. \n\nWould be a great base to build a Starbucks type coffee. Could add a bit of FW Hazelnut or WF Hazelnuts and Cream, a bit more coffee and maybe a touch more caramel and it would be really good. Could also \n add a little cooling for a cold frappuccino type coffee mix.\n\nWould be great to flavour creams, custards or cheesecakes, if you wanted to do a coffee flavoured cream or custard you could maybe add it at around 6-10%? Or use it lower to add a some of the lovely caramel note, a bit of creaminess and a more subtle coffee note. \n\nCould add toffee or butterscotch, alcohols like bourbon, chocolate (maybe something like VT Devon Cream), nuts like hazelnut or pecan, tobaccos - maybe Red Burley or Tatanka. I bet it would be really yummy with OSDIY Lucky Shot, would make a really good, really caramel-y latte with graham notes. Or maybe Mom & Pops Calipitter Chow could be interesting? Give it a nuttiness, extra caramel and a bit of a savoury note.",

I don't remember why, but I didn't like it at all, so I put it back in the steep drawer. At 2 months, it's very good, but way too rich for an ADV for my tastes. Graham cracker crust is very very dominant at this higher percentage, too much so, with a rich french vanilla cream drizzled with caramel? It's a nice moderately sweet blend, but the graham is very, very front and center. I am probably going to boost the cream in this. Wonderful thick buttery mouth feel. I like this a lot with the longer steep, and I think it's really needed due to the complexity of this flavor. I can already see this doing fantastic things in blends in the 1.5-5% range. Going to dilute the rest of this tester down to roughly equivalent to 10% and see what happens with it :) It's basically a rich french vanilla mousse pie with graham cracker crust and a touch of caramel. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:** None really, but needs a long steep for the graham cracker to settle down.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit:** 2/10\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Pairings:** Really good stand alone flavor.

I couldn't detect any off flavors, and it's not overly sweet like a candy. At a 2 week steep this is a wonderful refreshing mint. I can't figure out if I'm tasting spearmint or wintergreen though. I am leaning more towards spearmint as I'm getting that faint fruitiness that is usually found in spearmint and it's very refreshing which is more common to spearmint. And the bite of the menthol in this is just slightly lower than peppermint but more than is usually in spearmint. It also is missing any hints of green or pine type flavor. Ok, based on all that jumbled criteria, I am going to say this is a moderately sweet refreshing spearmint with a little heavier level of menthol. Soothing and cool with that light generic fruitiness in the back note.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:** None\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit:** 5/10\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Pairings:** Almost any fruit, tobaccos, creams, coffees, teas, candy, mints, chocolate, cucumbers.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Notes:** I can taste a nice spearmint gum with this as a single flavor at 2-4%.

I think tobaccos and teas will be great with this one as well.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Comparison:** FA White Winter is very similar, however it has a slight creaminess that isn't obvious in PUR's, and PUR is heavier in the menthol which gives it a little more of a cold kick and makes it seem a bit more refreshing.",

Not cloying at all, and not candy.\n\nAt 4 weeks this has smoothed out and become a creamy fresh banana without any hints of green. It's ripe and has natural levels of sweetness, nothing cloying or over ripe. A very balanced flavor, beyond green and before over ripe. There are no peel or green flavors in this.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:** None\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit:** 1/10\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Pairings:** Almost any fruit, especially those that pair well with banana like strawberry, kiwi, any tropicals fruits. Creams, custards, smoothies, shakes, nuts, honey.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Notes:** If you are looking for fresh banana, this is the one. I see it blending well with other fresh fruits. I don't think it would be good as the only banana anywhere you are looking for a cooked banana like bread or pastries or banana foster. In low percentages may add a bit of layering, but further testing is required to know for sure.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Comparison:** Comparing this to TFA Ripe Banana, this is much better for my tastes. The ripe banana has an over ripe almost starting to rot taint for my tastes, where as this is more of a perfectly ripened banana.",

Absolutely delicious and perfect for desserts and fruit blends!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Manufacturer Suggested Percentage:** 5-10%\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Aroma:** Blueberry, raspberry, sweetness.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Flavor Description:** Black raspberry or blackberry jam or jelly? I'm not positive on the berry blend here, but those are the ones that stand out for me. Moderate to strong flavor, it has a natural sweetness. Meaning it doesn't taste artificially sweetened, but it is sweet to the level of a jam or syrup. I don't find any artificial flavoring notes in the fruit either, tastes very authentic. It has a jammy cooked fruit type flavor. Very well layered and saturated in flavor, I know there are additional underlying berry flavors hiding there, I just can't identify them individually. They are from the seeded family though. I suspect marionberry, but I'm not positive.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:** None\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit:** 3/10\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Uses:** Because of it's cooked flavor, this will be the perfect fruit to use in baked applications. Pastries, danishes, cakes, doughnuts, pies, waffles, muffins, and coffee cakes are just a few. I would also be inclined to use this to make custards or flans, or as a fruit syrup on ice cream.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Notes:** Has a bit of throat hit, so I'm imagining it was prominent before steep, so I would recommend at least a 2 week steep. I'm hoping further steeping will help as I'm not a fan of throat hit. If not I will try a lower percentage, maybe 5% instead of 7%? Single flavor usage for me will be 5-7%, and 1.5-3% in blends.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Other Opinions:** From louiesquared at ELR: I know this one is called Berry Blue but I am definitely getting a darker berry from it. Possibly Blackberry or Boysenberry. Reminds me of Smuckers BlackBerry Jam but more of a syrup. It’s really good. I will definitely be adding this to some Vanilla Custard in the future.",

Naturally sweet similar to sweet cream butter, not a butter cream frosting. Butter flavor is dominant and very authentic, nothing artificial and definitely not like margarine. At a 2 week steep, the butter flavor has smoothed out just slightly with a longer steep into a more balanced butter with cream, the butter is not quite as dominant as when freshly mixed. It still a lovely creamy butter flavor, sweet and natural tasting. It has more of a rich fluffy whipped type mouth feel/body with the longer steep. This could easily be used as a dense rich butter flavor in the first few days, but it developed into a good whipped and fluffy butter cream with the additional steep time. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:** None\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit:** 0/10\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Pairings:** Almost any fruit you like with cream especially berries, try to avoid citrus and acidic fruits. Cookies, cakes, cereal, creams, nuts, tobaccos, bagels, cookies, cakes, pie crusts, custards, pastries. Anywhere you want butter.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Notes:** I was worried a little bit about it being too delicate to hold up to stronger flavors. It still needs more testing to see what it will provide to a variety of flavors. However, I did mix 2.5mls of the 6% tester with 2.5mls of pre-steeped Elephant Ear, and it's a delicious buttery frosted pastry with an amazing body.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Comparison:** CAP Butter Cream is a little less sweet and also has great body and a creamy mouth feel. It's butter flavor is more artificially flavored than PUR's and also has a faint astringent chemical note that does steep out when used in low percentages. CAP's is more of a cream with the butter being a lighter back note vs PUR's which is more of a sweet butter with the cream being the lighter back note. I personally prefer the flavor of PUR as the butter is authentic and more prominent, without having any chemical off flavors. However, I also think there are recipes where CAP's will work better, it's all dependent on the flavor profile you are seeking to create.\n\nThis is not a SF candidate for my tastes. I recommend 1-3% as an accent flavor. ",

It's very much a butter mint with the familiar body and buttery creamy mouth texture, not the hard candy or candy cane. Although it could be taken in that direction in mixes if desired. It provides a chilly cooling sensation without being peppery or too strong. At a 2 week steep this has mellowed slightly. I don't want to say the flavor has faded, it hasn't. I guess the best way to describe it is that it has continued to smooth out and become silky. It's still a wonderful creamy butter mint. The buttery creaminess is very distinctive in a good way. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:** None\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit:** 2/10\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Pairings:** I can see this being used to provide light peppermint to gums, cookies, teas, beverages, tobacco.

Or make flavored butter mints by adding vanillas or fruits.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Notes:** Although this did settle a bit with the steep, this was also very good as a S&V. It's just slightly stronger for the first few days, but still smooth, mouth-watering and delicious. For a SF I would probably bump it up to 3-4%, and .5-2% as an accent.\n",

The pecans are still very dominant, in a good way. The butter and caramel has really strengthened and stands up equally to the pecans now, and the dairy cream type creaminess has faded a little. It's still creamy, but it's more the rich creaminess you get from butter rather than milk or cream.

The pecan nut is more prominent and it's moderately sweet. FW has a lot stronger and heavier cream component, almost like a butter pecan ice cream. It's also sweeter and the pecan isn't quite as dominant. Both of these are very good and will provide different notes to recipes.",

I don't get the actual crunch of the pralines, but the crystallized butter and brown sugar candied pecans is so authentic I can almost imagine it when I close my eyes.

At the 2 week steep mark this hasn't changed drastically so it would make a good shake and vape.

The warm cream is mild and has smoothed out just slightly and it's still a robust roast with that surprising sweetness at the end. The mild bitterness/darkness of the coffee bean is also now more noticable on the beginning of the exhale as well, so overall this has become more balanced during both inhale and exhale.

It's not overly sweet or syrupy, and I think that might be why it avoids that flatness. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:** None\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit:** 1/10\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Uses:** Cherry cola single flavor. Cherry cola slurpee with some added WS-23 or Koolada. Maybe with a gummy candy flavor for cherry cola gummies? A vanilla would be good in this, just a plain vanilla like bourbon vanilla, nothing with cream notes. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Notes:** I'm not quite sure what this could used in. Excellent single flavor cherry cola. Although I don't like cherry cola, I might have to try this with some of that ws-23 cooling agent I requested and turn this into a yummy cherry cola slurpee. Good strength at this percentage, 6-8% for a single flavor.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Other Opinions:** From louiesquared on ELR. Very convincing Cherry Cola. Nicely balanced with no cough syrup aftertaste. It doesn’t taste like it’s carbonated but also not flat like most Cola flavors. I’m assuming the Cherry is adding this effect. I’m not really a Cola fan but I could definitely vape this all by itself.",

It reminds me of a light chocolate cake or cupcake, although it seems slightly dry. An authentic cocoa type flavored chocolate, not dark and bitter, nor sweet like milk chocolate. I'm not getting any frosting, just the cake. I'm not getting much in the way of mouth feel, I do feel it needs a longer steep.The chocolate isn't strong enough for a fully flavor saturated chocolate cake really, just too light. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:** None\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit:** 2/10\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Uses:** It would be a good base or additive to work with for any chocolate cake, especially good with Purilum Chocolate Cherry to create a solid base for a black forest cake.

Would be  to help add body in creating chocolate puddings, creams, or custards.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Notes:** Very mild chocolate, I'm not sure increasing the percentage will really help strengthen it. I'm afraid it might also increase the dryness. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Other Opinions:** From louiesquared on ELR: This is a really great Chocolate Cake. I cranked the heat up on this one and it got even better. It has a bit of a Brownie taste but not quite as rich… It’s more of just a slightly under cooked cake.",

The flavor is there, but I think it will be lost underneath other flavors other than providing body, so I am interested to see what happens with a full steep.\n\n10 Days:  This has surprised me with how much it strengthened with the longer steep time. The depth and strength has developed enough that I believe it will stand up to other flavors . A buttery fluffy shortbread cookie, with the breadiness being prominent rather than dry and crispy. It has a faint caramelization on the end of the exhale that gives it a lightly baked taste, with a sweet vanilla inhale. Its a spot on flavor of Lorna Doone shortbread cookies.

It's slightly tangy and slightly sweet cream cheese filling. The almond comes through on the top as well, and the bread is very light and only found on the exhale. It actually has a full bodied mouth feel. The bready aspect does taste very similar to a danish. Not quite strong enough at this point. Definitely unbalanced, both the cheese filling and almonds are very forward, with the danish very light. It could still change with a longer steep. I have a feeling it might be a little better at a higher percentage. It's a pretty complete flavoring, so I am going to try in the 9-12% range and see if the danish come out to play. The flavors have become more balanced with the longer steep. I don't think the danish flavor strengthened, rather the cream cheese and almonds seemed to settle into the danish.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Purilium Grapefruit Mojito, 3 and 8%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 5 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  [Nicotine River calls this \"A beautiful blend of citrus and happiness. A great beverage and a necessity for a nice summers day vape!\"](https://www.nicotineriver.com/products/purilum-grapefruit-mojito)  The citrus note here feels a lot like a ruby red grapefruit juice type of flavor. Not much in the way of zest or something like a white grapefruit tartness. Grapefruit is definitely present, but feels a bit sweet, subtle, and one dimensional next to the mint. The mint here is doing a pretty convincing job of tasting like a mint muddled with sugar. Definitely a spearmint as opposed to peppermint flavor.  Mint leaf flavor is taking a bit of a  backseat to the pretty heavy white sugar sweetness note. Mouthfeel is a bit dry to me, and I'm getting some grittiness that along with the heavy white sugar note is kind of reminding me of a mojito made with granulated sugar that hasn't quite been stirred enough.  No rum in sight. Very light cooling here, more tied into the spearmint flavor than a full beverage cooling.  It's a good start on the profile, but it gets a lot better with some added cooling, and I could see adding in some TPA Champagne to kind of thin this out and pull it closer to a beverage profile.  I'd use this a primary flavor around 5%.\n\nInhale is warm and sweet. I get mostly white sugar from the inhale.  Lighter mint top notes, manages to avoid going too toothpaste-ish which is a going concern mixing citrus with spearmint. Some lighter slightly bitter grapefruit as the inhale builds. Exhale has grapefruit up front. Sweet, kind of flat ruby red grapefruit juice flavor.  This concentrate vapes a little warm overall and it kind of washes out the more delicate parts of the grapefruit.  No real zest, but there is some grapefruit bitterness in the top notes.  That grapefruit gets pushed around by the spearmint and sugar on the back half of the exhale. A little bit of a spearmint leaf flavor, but the base tastes like pretty straight white sugar. Dryer mouthfeel on the back half of the exhale, with a bit of a gritty white sugar feeling.  Some very light cooling on the end of the exhale, but it's still a bit distractingly warm overall solo.  Lingering sugar lips, sweet spearmint, and a bit of dryness.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Nah, maybe a bit oversweet, warm, and sugary for what I'd expect for a mojito.\n\n**Throat Hit:**Light, more from the dryness than the citrus.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This vapes warmer than you'd expect for a beverage profile. Mixing this with a cooling agent should help considerably.  I've been screwing around with some ws-23, but the pre-existing mint in here is a good excuse to bust out the straight menthol. Seems to help thin out some the sugary base and cools this down for more of a cocktail effect.\n\nI could see bolstering the grapefruit here with some FW Ruby Red Grapefruit to bring in some of the zest notes missing from an actual muddled grapefruit.  I could also see adding some INW White Grapefruit for some of the missing tartness.  The sweeter grapefruit note here would also stand up pretty well to a brighter, realistic lime like FA Lime Distilled.\n\nIf you want to go further down the rabbit hole, I could see TPA Champagne working really well here to further water this down and at least attempt to add some bite to this.  I'd stay away from adding a rum flavor, as most of those tend to be closer to a spiced rum without much booziness, and you need a white rum for a mojito.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, 3% actually has a pretty good balance of citrus and mint. Mouthfeel isn't too dry and the sweetness level isn't overwhelming. 5% tastes a bit more solid, and the sugar on the mint note is coming through quite a bit clearer.  Grapefruit feels like more a background player, but I'm getting some light bitterness which helps the profile. At 7% this is getting fairly dry to me, and it's maybe pushing a bit too sweet. Grapefruit is even more in the background here. At 9% this is even dryer, and even sweeter. Admirable job of tasting like white sugar, there's just too much of it. I'd mix this at 5%, with some added cooling to help that warm, dry sugar note.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[One note on ELR from user \"juice junkie\": \"The grapefruit reminds me of FW ruby red with some RF Orange added to it.9 out of 10. This almost has a fizzy kind of taste to it. I like the grapefruit flavor that’s in it. It almost seems like the grapefruit has some hints of orange citrus in it as well. The mint in it is perfect! It’s not overwhelming at all. I'm also feeling like I'm getting a hint of lime. It reminds me of a 7up type flavor with grapefruit and mint. I could see adding some orange, strawberry, kiwi, and passion fruit to this flavor!\"](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/195361)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Dual: 8-10 wrap 3mmid 316LSS Temp control 400-520 degrees. Sweet spot around 500.\n\nLike biting into a fresh mango. Lightly fleshy, slightly chemically like a mango. But not in a bad way. Many manufacturers of these tropical fruits will have an extremely off chemical taste but this one is spot on the real thing after a few days steep. Not too sweet. Sweetener or marshmallow a huge plus.\n\n1% Great for cocktail mixes. Can add a nice tropical note. Light and refreshing it mixes well with other fruits in a medley. \n2% Stronger but not a full on independent flavor. Will standout more as a main flavor in tropical blends. I'd use it here if I were to use say two fruits like a mango kiwi. \n3% Awesome main flavor. Could easily all day vape by itself or with some light creams, vanilla and marshmallow. Great as the frontrunner in any rum drink or alcohol vape. Fruit mix surprise. \n4% Would probably just not be a good idea. Way too strong. Think heavy floral.\n\nMixes with:\n\nVanillas: depending on application\n\nCreams: vienna, sweet cream, bavarian, fresh cream, vanilla swirl, light custard v1 (oh yeah), marshmallows, whipped cream, buttercream, torrone, vanilla cream, yogurts. Thicker cheesy like creams could be very nice with the proper sweetener.\n\nFruits: Anything you can imagine tropical. Other mangos (fleshy ones, use this as the pop), FA kiwi, pineapple, good guava, coconut, papaya, lime, orange, lemon, citrus in general, blackberries, black currant, real cherry, banana, raspberry, watermelon, peach, oba oba.\n\nFloral: rose, ylang ylang, honeysuckle, hibiscus, cactus, lavender\n\nBakery: I don't know how far I'd go here but I can see a really smooth or light flaky thing going here. if you get creative you may be able to do something with FA cookie, INW biscuit, light sugar cookie (maybe), zeppola, cap yellow cake, nonna's cake. Perhaps a creamy sort of cookie.\n\nAll in all a solid mango. I'm going to try and keep this in my collection. I have MANY ideas on it's use and after reading this, I hope you do too.",

Which I also like, vaping it physically makes my mouth water. Surprisingly it's not acidic at all, no rough throat hit that is so common with citrus. At least not with short vaping time. Will have to see what happens with longer vaping.\n\nAt 4 weeks the lemon has unexpectedly hung in there and not faded as badly as they usually do. The tartness is still there, but it has mellowed just a bit. The sour lemon candy aspect is gone and it's straight lemonade now. It's still mouthwatering and very good. However if you like a more tart/sour lemonade that you can almost feel in your jaw, or a sour lemon candy, I would only make enough for a week or 2 at a time. If you like a more mellow version, it's good in 3-4 weeks.

At a 2 week steep this has lost that sticky marshmallow crème it had before, and has developed into the most realistic marshmallow flavor I have tasted yet, even down to the powdery sweet outside of the marshmallow and the fluffy but still chewy body/mouthfeel. Except....vanilla. It still seems to have a noticeable vanilla flavor to me, which may put a few limitations on what you can mix it with, but very few as most things taste great with vanilla.

And yes, that is very subjective and you may hate it with a passion. Like I hate FA Joy when I'm craving a flat warm beer, like never!

As an accent anywhere from .5-5% depending on the flavor or effect you are trying to achieve.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Comparison:** CAP's is also very sweet, but is missing that body/mouthfeel and doesn't really taste like marshmallow to me, just generic sweetness. FA is a very good marshmallow, it has a sweet and mild marshmallow flavor that has a fantastic thick mouth feel and body. The marshmallow flavor is delicate and usually overwhelmed easily with the addition of addition flavors. I use it as a sweetener and body enhancer rather than flavor. RF is very similar to FA in that it's a great sweetener and body enhancer with a very mild actual marshmallow flavor. PUR's version actually has a moderate to full marshmallow flavor itself along with body and it's not just a generic sweetness. But, as I've only tested the single flavor so far I'm not sure how strongly the flavor itself will stand out against other flavors.",

It's a very unique flavor that doesn't have anything similar from other manufacturers that I'm aware of. Will update after a longer steep.\n\n**EDIT:** The hint of coconut steeped out. It seems it was the note I was getting from the graham cracker at first that mellowed with time. I'm not sure at what week it went from being Coconut Pie to NY Cheesecake, but it happened. Two flavors in one, S&V is Coconut Pie with Graham crust. Then it turns into a wonderfully thick creamy tangy cheesecake with a more pronounced graham crust than CAP's.",

Pretty artificial. Tastes somewhere between an Ocean Spray Grape-Cranberry and Grape Kool Aid. There’s a nice dark, candy grape flavor shining through. It has a somewhat cool finish and is not very ‘juicy’ on its own. I find it lacks body for a juice at here at 7% but it is very tasty standalone. \n\n\n**I recommend this at 8-10% by itself *or with a touch of INW cactus and koolada*.**\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Nothing really. Its got a little bit of cranberry peeking through but I think that was intended.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Mild to none (1/10)\n\n**Uses:**  Grape Drink! This is going to be used mainly for drink recipes, candies or just straight up fruit blends. Works great as a grape/light cranberry base. I find the cranberry stands out more after about a month and the darker grape notes die out. This blends well with other flavors in personal use from 4-10% anything less than 4% gets lost easily.\n\n**Pairings:**  Fruit pairings: Some berries (strawberry/cranberry come to mind first), mango, pear, apple, guava, pomegranate, exotic fruits, more grape? and definitely prickly pear (cactus). This can work with vanilla if you like that sort of thing. Definitely a great concentrate to make grape drinks or candies. Citrus can work sometimes but flavors like FA lime tahity may not play well with this one.\n\n**Notes:** Definitely a great shake and vape flavor. After a couple of weeks the grape fades and the cranberry stands out a little more. At 9-10% it steeps better and is my preferred standalone for this one.\n\nA quick shake and vape recipe I like is:\n\nPR Ocean Myst 9%\n\nKoolada .5%\n\nINW Cactus .3%\n\nNN Erythritol 2%\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nNot a lot out there on this one and it is the only grape flavor I own. \n\nThere’s three reviews on Nicotine River’s site all very positive stuff.\n\n**If you decide to pick this up or maybe you just need a reason to, check out my Skittles recipe, it’s a simplified version of another skittles recipe I found. Ocean Myst pulls its weight in that recipe and I think it came out fantastic. Shake it vape it and love it**\n\nhttps://alltheflavors.com/recipes/26122#skittles_v1_by_vdevil \n\n\n**Side-note:** on ATF this is still Nicotine River Ocean Myst, or NR ocean myst.

When looking for it I do get hints of mango and papaya, but it just blends into a fruity gum. Has a noticeable throat hit at 5 days. At 2 weeks both the papaya and mango has matured into an authentic fresh fruit flavored gum. It's not an artificially flavored gum.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Purilum Passion Fruit, 3 and 8%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 7 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Syrupy passion fruit flavor. I get some sort of mix of yellow peach, sweet guava, and maybe a candy strawberry.  Nothing much in the way of tart notes beyond the edges of the inhale, and no real acidic, bright edge.  Thicker syrupy mouthfeel and very little in the way of harshness.  Seems like a pretty solid passionfruit for bakeries or anything using a passionfruit syrup.  Also would probably blend with damn near any fruit without an issue, and the lack of acidity makes it an option with heavier creams or mixes with stronger dairy notes. Pretty linear, I'd use this around 4% for an accent, but would probably blend into a lot of fruit based flavors up to 6% without calling too much attention to itself.  Primary note usage is probably a bit higher at around 8%.\n\nInhale is sweet and I do get some mild tarter mouthfeel. Inhale tastes very yellow peach to me, without going full on into peach rings. Moderately dense, but it does seem to have a bit syrupy stickiness to it. Exhale is a bit more complex with an initial burst of peach, then something that tastes a lot like CAP Sweet Guava. Maybe just a bit of tartness in the top notes but it's pretty light and the actually fruit base is pretty heavy and warm. Back half of the exhale picks up a strawberry or kiwi candy kind of vibe.  Some light harshness, but nothing major. Some tartness shows back up on the tail end of the exhale after that syrupy fruit calms down a bit.  Lingering sugar lips and some the tarter part of this makes your lips just a bit raw after some prolonged vaping.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  I don't have a ton of experience with less processed passionfruit, but this doesn't really have that tarter edge and bright acidity that is probably closer to a fresh or minimally processed passionfruit.  Nothing here tastes off or unpleasant though. \n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light.  Not in the same universe as FA Throat Razors, but has a bit of a bite to it.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Kind of another rorschach test of a fruit.  I'm pretty sure you can find almost any kind of fruit note you need in this if you look hard enough.  I don't think there are many fruits that wouldn't go well with this.  I'd say citrus would be a good pairing to try to add back in some tarter notes.  Also would work well as a kind of non-descript tropical background noise in mixes.\n\nDoesn't really have anything floral or green, so should blend a bit better with creams than CAP passionfruit, and doesn't have the bright acidity that FA has which gets weird with buttery notes.\n\nSeems like a pretty good choice for a passion fruit syrup in cocktail/beverage vapes and may actually work well in bakery application.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, this comes across as pretty linear.  Kind of soft and non-descript at 3%. Definitely tastes fruity but it's a bit hard to figure out what's going on. A bit bolder and sweeter at 5% but maybe just a hair light for a primary note. 7% still doesn't have anything floral or weird, and I'm maybe getting a bit of that tartness but it's balanced out by a really heavy sweetness. At 9% this is starting to feel a bit blown out and oversweet, and it's picking up a bitter edge.  I'd use this up to about 7-8% as a primary note, but it should be pretty flexible as an accent. I don't think it will really disagree or dominate clearer fruit profiles, so probably around 4-6% depending on how much sweetness you want.\n\nThe passion fruits I'm most acquainted with are Capella, and Flavourart. I'd say this skews closer to the Capella side of things, but a bit sweeter. Capella has that same slightly candy edge to it and seems to have a heavier white gummy bear/dragonfruit/candy pineapple flavor along with something that tastes a bit more floral and green as well. Flavourart is bright, tart, and acidic and has a tendency to rip up throats.  This isn't a unpleasant flavor by any means, but it doesn't deliver on the pipe dream of something that captures that tart brightness without wrecking my throat.  Tasting them side by side, will probably replace CAP passion fruit for me.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[One, again very positive, note on ELR from user \"juice junkie\": \"10 out of 10! Great Passion Fruit flavor! I really want to add some Strawberry, Orange, and Pomelo to it and have a tropical punch type vape! It’s a really good stand alone flavor! Reminds me of FA Passion Fruit with a little bit of FLV guava added to it. \"](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/86633)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Cloves?\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Flavor Description:** I didn't a chance to try this until a 4 week steep, so I'm not sure how it changes, fades or not, or is a good S&V. Sweet vanilla/yellow cake with authentic pineapple. The pineapple is sweet and not sharp at all, and also the first thing you taste. It's not a fresh cut pineapple, it's canned pineapple. But it tastes cooked like you would find in a pineapple upside down cake. The cake takes over on the exhale. It is a cross between a vanilla and a yellow cake. I can almost taste a faint hint of caramel or brown sugar In the cake itself, which swings it slightly to the yellow cake side, yet the vanilla is still present. There is no caramelized/brown sugar flavor to the pineapple like found in an upside down cake. It's part of the cake component, which is also just grainy enough to have a great cake body, but it's also somehow creamy. I'm not sure where the cream comes from, but it lingers there at the end of the exhale. It's almost like a butter? Overall a very complex flavor.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:** None\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit:** 3/10\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Pairings:** Other fruits that are typically good with pineapple.

I will probably start at 4% as a base, then accent from there. I really like this one, a unique flavor.\n",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Purilium Pomelo, 3 and 8%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 6 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Pretty much a pomelo.  If you've never had a pomelo, flavorwise they seem to be what a tangerine is to an orange for grapefruit. Same basic flavor, but a lot sweeter and milder, without much in the way of bitterness and less tartness.  This fits that profile pretty well. Sweet, full, and relatively mellow for a citrus, and the light bitterness almost takes on a bit of a marmalade candied zest vibe but with limes instead of oranges.  There's some muskiness in those top notes as well, but it isn't too intense as long as this isn't cranked up too much. Seems like a version of grapefruit that'll be a lot easier to mix with than most actual grapefruits.  I'd keep this around 5% as a primary note, and maybe around 2-3% as a light sweet accent. \n\nInhale is sweet pomelo.  There's a denser, ruby red grapefruit kind of taste with something like a light candied lime zest top note and just a tiny hit of a fairly realistic grapefruit bitterness. A bit too sweet to feel super realistic for a citrus, but it's definitely close to a sweeter pomelo.  Mouthfeel is fairly full but it doesn't have that wax thing you get with something like sweeter orange flavors. Exhale is pretty much a pomelo, sweet up front, fairly heavily saturated flavor.  Citrus musk in the top notes.  Strength really depends on concentration. At 5% it's more of an interesting accent. Pushing toward 9% it gets a bit soapy and weird. Zest note feels a little bit like a mixture of bergamot and maybe something cedar or sandalwood-ish. Light bit of slightly bitter lime zest comes in on the back end of exhale, but it's pretty subtle compared to the bitterness in a realistic grapefruit concentrate.  Some lingering higher citrus notes. \n\n**Off-flavors:**  There's a definite musk to this.  It actually seems fairly realistic for a pomelo, with a bit of dry, spicy, bergamot note and an almost woody ripeness.  Not really off then, but it can get weird if you overdo it.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light.  Definitely on the low side for a citrus.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  It's almost like the straight ruby red part of a ruby red grapefruit. Mild and sweet, but still with that distinct grapefruit character. I could see using this to fill in citrus flavors without adding to much extra zest or baggage beyond that light musk. Adding sweetness to grapefruit would be the obvious, but it could help give you more flavor behind tarter, zestier citrus without dumping more throat hit onto the profile.\n\nCitrus in general works well with melons and cucumber and all that, but this being a bit sweeter it would probably blend better with darker, syrupy fruits instead of just acting as a tart counterpoint.\n\nSeems like a good fit for mixing with creams if you keep it low enough to miss most of that musk. Tarter grapefruits get really weird with dairy notes, and this being just the sweet part of the grapefruit would probably open it up a bit.\n\nAll of the cocktail / citrus soda vapes, basically.  \n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, 3% doesn't seem to have much of that musk or soapy note to it, but the pomelo flavor seems a bit weak.  It's juicier down here, but a thinner flavor. At 5% that musk is a bit more prominent, but it's kind of an interesting off-flavor that seems to add a bit of realism to the concentrate.  The musk is almost working like a light bergamot peppery note and kind of sells some of the peel and pith, in case you weren't super careful with your supremes.  Base pomelo flavor is nice and sweet, with maybe just a tiny hit of a bitter accent. At 7% the pomelo is a bit sweeter and bolder, but that musk is a bit heavier and feeling almost a bit soapy.  It's a bit distracting.  At 9% it's probably a bit too musky for me.  I'd probably start around 5% mixing with this, maybe 7% if I was planning on a 2 week steep where it had some time to die down a bit.\n\nAlso fairly difficult to say 5 times fast.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[One note on ELR from user \"juice junkie\": \" \t9 out of 10. It’s a great sweet orangy/grapefruity flavor. I think this would go good with mango, strawberry, guava, tropical fruits, citrus fruits, cakes, cheesecake bars, coconut, and creams. I'm really enjoying this! This is something that’s a little different than the other grapefruit flavors that I have tried.\"](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/86623)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

I don't know if it's because the flavor is so authentic that it's playing tricks on me, or if it's really there. Can't wait to hear from others about this one. I haven't found a rice krispie or oat cereal I like yet. They all seem overly grainy and gross to me. This one doesn't, it has just a faint hint of grain, enough to say cereal without screaming oats! The cereal is equally balanced with the marshmallows, which are those crunchy artificially flavored strawberry cereal ones, not the fluffy type. This hasn't changed much from the shorter steep. The flavors are still pretty much as described before, maybe blended a little more? I'm almost getting a tiny creaminess from it that I didn't notice before.

It has some similar flavor aspects, but it is missing that sharp tangy tartness. And it has a very noticeable chemical off note. The fruits do blend and balance well without either overpowering the other. It's just a little closer to celery than rhubarb. Not getting crust at this point, and not sweet or sour enough. With the longer steep this has really blended well and matured into a great blend. The strawberry and rhubarb is balanced well, and has turned into a sweet and slightly tart pie filling. The strawberry has lost any artificial taint and is cooked and sweetened. The rhubarb left the celery behind and is a very authentic cooked rhubarb, but is missing that pronounced tartness. On the exhale I'm getting a light flour crust.

No detectable vanilla flavor, nor tanginess. Very natural level of sweetness for a yogurt smoothie, with all the sweetness originating from the fruit itself and no sweeteners added.

    "markdown": "**DISCLAIMER:** (Skip if it's too long for you)  Living in the household with a pack-a-day smoker, irregular diet with heavy coffee consumption and minor allergy issues - my buds may not be very good when it comes to providing a good review.  Yet this flavor impressed me enough that it warranted it.  Also note that I'm not a tobacco expert by any measure.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Setup** Theorem RDTA with 27 ga. SS316L single coil, 6.5 wraps, ohm-ing out at .76-.79, 16-18 watts in power mode, full cotton wicking\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Testing** 7.5% in a 65/35 VG/PG base, approx. 10 mL, no steep time (SnV).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Flavor Description** A somewhat sweet tobacco that is mostly pipe.  I get the sense that it's a blended tobacco, but unsure which types... am guessing Burley and/or Virginia, with a dark leaf of some kind possibly thrown into it.  The sweetness seems to be inherent to the leaf... like some kind of Cavendish.  Yet am picking up notes of wood/grain/nuts/granola, so it produces a somewhat complex earthy tone.  It is not a rich or bold tobacco hit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Off Flavors/Mouth Feel** Not really detecting anything off... yet am thinking there is a hint of rum or even butter/cream.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Throat Hit** Quite mild but present.  With chain-vaping, get a slight feel of having smoked.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Uses** As a stand-alone, it is pretty impressive.  I can easily see this as being an all-day choice for me.  Believe that a dark coffee could be paired with it.  Or someone could mix in caramel and vanilla to make themselves a custom RY4.  Also believe that fruit pairings might work nicely, namely a light apple or mild cherry.... possibly even banana.  I don't really see this as being a component of elaborate tobacco mixtures nor necessarily a substitute for RY4 or other tobaccos, per se.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Speculation** I am guessing that Cavendish is one type of tobacco that is used to make certain RY formulas, thus this flavor may have been an attempt to create one when they realized it's just fine on it's own.  Not sure if any sweetener is used for Runyans, so Cavendish does make a lot of sense.  I don't believe any Turkish leaf flavors were used.  Cigarette lovers may not like this at all.  And if a person wanted additional throat-hit, they might try using a bourbon/whiskey \"additive\" flavoring.  As to the suggestion of coffee, was vaping it when I opened a fresh container of Folgers and loved the aroma combination!  I STRONGLY feel that it would be super addicting if the right choice was made for which coffee to use.   Going out on a limb, might say FA Espresso (Dark Bean) but no real knowledge of what percentages would be good.  Maybe 8% this and 1% Espresso??  Also believe that those who enjoy TFA's RY4 Double as a stand-alone should mix this at the same percentages (strength).  Can possibly be paired with creams??",

Sweetened toasted coconut is strong and up front, and it's very authentic. Below that I'm getting a sweet pudding like cream, with hints of vanilla and faint graham crust?

I'm enjoying it immensely, and hoping the cream will pop with a longer steep. At 4 weeks, this has developed into a nice dense thickness similar to a cheesecake. I'm still not getting any cream cheese though. It's a delicious coconut cream pie, with thick sweet vanilla and coconut pudding and a buttery graham crust.

Not like a dense fresh cream or ice cream, but a smooth creamed mango like it's been blended with a coconut milk as the base maybe? The coconut is faint and missing any toasted flavor. It's also missing that slight tart or tang usually present with a sherbet. It's more of a fruit sorbet to me. It's naturally sweet like the normal sweetness of fruit vs a sugar sweetened sherbet.

It would be good paired with almost any tropical fruit for fruit punches or smoothies. Additional creamy or toasted coconut to add some support to what is already there.

The Coconut is very light but lingers after the exhale. Doesn’t taste much like a Sherbet as it’s not really creamy. I would say this tastes more like a Sorbet. Either way, it’s very nice.",

At 4 weeks the bourbon has smoothed out really well and is definitely the first thing you taste. At 4 days the cream was prominent with the bourbon on the exhale, and that has completely flipped with the longer steep. Smooth bourbon is up front, with a light creamy vanilla back note.

PUR is not as rich and heavy, and doesn't have the egginess and dark vanilla, in a good way. It is easy to become tired of CAP's at times due to the richness, like eating too much dessert. PUR has a brighter and more prominent vanilla creaminess. Compared to FLV, PUR is not as concentrated 4-6% vs 8-11%. PUR is slightly more vanilla prominent and creamy than FLV, similar in flavor profiles otherwise. FLV tastes a little more mild/watered down/milky rather than creamy in comparison. Would I buy this?

Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing** Purilum Watermelon @ 4%. 70/30 VG/PG base.\n\n**Flavor Notes** \n\nAfter hearing all this buzz lately about Purilums' watermelon possibly dethroning the LA Watermelon as the king of candy watermelons I had to take it for a test drive. I tend to take my watermelon pretty seriously so this was a bold statement but I put on my \"objective\" hat to dive into this review.\n\nOn the nose it certainly doesn't scream Jolly Rancher like LA Watermelon does or even TPA (to a lesser degree) for that matter. It smells softer and more realistic and somewhat reminds me of a more robust version of FA's red summer watermelon where you can sense the soft fibrous fleshy texture of the actual fruit. Some good realism but you also detect there is some good sweetness in there as well. I definitely do not get Jolly Ranchers like you get from LA Watermelon. I am beginning to suspect this is one of those \"hybrid\" part realistic and part candied flavors. \n\nInhale has a nice building sweetness with a grainy/fibrous texture that is pretty fleshlike-not quite as dry as FA. It combines to make somewhat of a \"mushy\" texture. It is not a bad thing but I don't know that I've run across a similar texture. There are some realistic watermelon notes in there but I am also getting something close to raspberry coming along for the ride. That sweet 'berry' like note is perhaps where some folks are getting the candy from this. I am getting something closer to a pumped up less realistic FA Watermelon. It seems like it will have more presence in a mix which has always been an issue with me using FA Watermelon. It has a nice natural sweetness to it perhaps as if it is more ripe. \n\nOverall it is a pretty nice watermelon flavor but I fail to see any comparisons to LA Watermelon which is straight watermelon hard candy with virtually not a hint of realism. I would say this Purilum is 70 percent realistic and 30 percent sweetness or as ID10-T might say, \"it has an identity crisis\". I would place it on the spectrum of watermelon somewhere between FA's and TPA's...leaning much closer to FA. Or if you isolated the watermelon in Flavorahs Wild Melon this might be close. It is a nice flavor overall but it doesn't immediately scream to me where I would use it.\n\n**Off Flavors** Not really getting any off flavors but I do get a subtle secondary berry note. \n\n**Throat Hit** Not getting anything unduly harsh. Bear in mind I vape relatively low wattage mid-ohm so can't say how it would react at high wattages.\n\n**Uses/Pairings** I could see this working in situations where you want a nice soft medley of fairly realistic melons. It would probably pair great with Flavorahs Wild Melons, INW Melon, Cap Cantaloupe. It might be a good booster to get FA's Watermelon to come alive better in a mix. Any fruits where you want some realism with a ripened sweetness. I just don't think it stacks up well as a straight candy and in my mind anyway, LA Watermelon can rest comfortably as the candy king in my mixing for now.\n\n",

I am getting the spun sugar flavor, it's a mild and somewhat delicate flavor. Very sweet and sugary, with a very light artificial candy like watermelon in the back. It's actually balanced very well in that the watermelon is there yet the cotton candy is still dominant. The only thing throwing me off is it has an unpleasant off note, like a floral/perfume? It's not offensive, but definitely out of place. \n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:** Floral/perfume\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit:** 1/10\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Pairings:** Sweetener for watermelon, accent fruit candies, gum?

I'm thinking 8-10% for a single flavor, providing the perfume note steeps out and it doesn't get too sugary, will need further testing. Otherwise I would probably only use it in trying to make candy or gum.",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** RF SC Baja Soda @ 2% and 4%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 10 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Moutain Dew Baja Blast.  A bit on the thin side, and maybe high on the citrus, but it definitely has a relatively subtle \"blue\" kind of note in there. More like the kind of blue you taste in blue gatorade than an actual fruit,  reading up on people are claiming blue raspberry, blueberry, coconut, more lime, and even honeydew. I can't pick any of that out distinctly here, but it definitely tastes fairly close to baja blast and it definitely feels blue. I'm finding it a bit on the thin and dry side, even up at 4%, but it seems to be capturing the essential \"blueness\" as well as good citrus-y kick from the moutain dew base.  I'd maybe add some wetness in here, or drag into a slush form, but otherwise I think this is pretty close to a one-shot. I'd use at around 3-4%.\n\nInhale is mostly lime. A bit sharp, bordering on tart and bitter, but still pretty candied. Syrupy sweet, but missing a bit of wetness to really nail the soda thing. Inhale is a bit on the airy and thin side. Exhale has the \"baja\" here prettly clearly up front. Maybe some blueberry or blue raspberry kind of artifical blue flavor, with some perfumey top notes. Lime comes back a bit on the tail end of the exhale with just a bit of bitterness and some harshness. Sweet, but airy and a bit dry. Needs some more body. Lingering floral, almost soapy note.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Nah, not really. Tastes blue, tastes like mountain dew.  It tastes a bit soapy, but so does Baja Blast. Texture is a bit dry, but the flavor is on point.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Light to moderate. All the citrus here is a bit harsh and dry.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  To make this into a more accurate baja blast, I'd look to fill it out and add some wetness back into it. I'd probably go with a small percentage of INW Cactus, or CAP Cucumber, and maybe a hint of FA Aurora or FA Lime Distilled to punch up the citrus a bit and try to get something kind of like carbonation back in here. If you want to go the slushie route, you'll need some koolada and maybe just a bit of texture from FA Oba Oba.\n\nOutside of your dew-based applications, I'm a bit stumped. There is an essential dew-ness in here that'll be hard to mix around. I don't think it would clash with other fruits, but it'll still taste like mountain dew with fruit on top.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, this is thin and light at 1%. Mostly slihtly bitter lime and a really floral \"baja\" blue type of flavor. 2% has a bit more body, the lime has kind of come together, although the baja part of still thin and floral.  3% is a bit more cohesive. Good dew base, baja is blending okay but still doesn't quite cohere. 4% has a stronger baja and it's blending better with the citrus base. 5% is back to a bit floral.  I'd mix with this at 3-4%.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Here's the ELR Page for the VG version, not a ton of info but people suggest throwing more heat at this concentrate. Seems to work fairly well to get more citrus out of it.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/82473)\n\n[On the ELR Forum, there's a post by user \"Flavor_Alchemist\" that seems to have a some pretty positve stuff to say about the VG version.](http://forum.e-liquid-recipes.com/t/real-flavors-all-natural-vg-based-flavors/51199/2)\n\n\"BAJA SODA: This is an interesting blend of what seems to be a citrus with the sharp citrusy notes removed by design.....then blended with a subtle note of coconut.....It does take you to the beach, so to speak (I will elaborate in my summary) I was hoping for a \"sparkle\" based on its' name, but that wasn't the case here, However, a clever blender could easily remedy that with the addition of a few select ingredients, perhaps a Champagne flavor....... Koolada maybe?\n\nLike the others, it is a super smooth vape, without harsh volatiles taste after such a short steep time, rendering it a very pleasant vape.....\n\nPlaying with device wattage, vape technique, ie. \"hotboxing\" and \"french inhaling\", \"nasal exhale\", etc. really is where this flavor shines, as it does bring flavor essences forward and shifts from light citrus to coconut and back again......all without vapors tongue for the whole tank.\"\n\nI'm inclined to call bullshit on the review, but that could just be the writing style.\n\n[One 2-star review from user \"Joshua Baker\" on Diy-ejuice.com, he states \"the taste of this one could be better.\"  Truly a review for the ages.](https://www.diy-ejuice.com/Baja-Soda-by-Real-Flavors-p/real-bajasoda.htm)\n\n[Here's the product page from Real Flavors.

Rose hits you throughout the entire vape. Its pleasant and not overbearing, but its all over this one even though there’s no mention of rose water on the [RF site](http://www.realflavors.com/shop/baklava-super-concentrate/) The site mentions walnuts/pistachio but I don’t get much nuttiness here. \n\n**Off-flavors**: \nNo, real baklava has rose water and I was expecting some.

Its pretty strong and I think right at 2% it could pass as a baklava e-juice, maybe a little TFA marshmallow to round it out (that’s been my cheat for everything lately). Because of it’s complexity its going to be tough to mix. If you just want the puff pastry part or just the rose water part to shine, I am not sure how to go about doing that. It’s pretty balanced. I must mention that as a S&V its just 100% rose water and that tones down day by day. After a week its pretty stellar how much this changed and I imagine a month will be even better. \n\n**Second Opinions**\n\nCouple of mentions on the ELR forums\n\n*[I liked the RF SC Baklava as a 3.5% standalone originally but quickly got bored of it as the clove/cinnamon notes overpowered the filo dough notes even after a long steep so I ended up mixing it with my Pumpkin Pie single flavor batch and added in some RF VG Banana Bread flavoring I had left. I hope it turns out OK as it ended up literally being a half liter of juice once all mixed together.](http://forum.e-liquid-recipes.com/t/real-flavors-super-concentrates-tasting-notes/92474/343)\n\nEdit: this guy mentions clove/cinnamon but I'm not getting any\n\n*[I haven't figured out the RF Baklava yet.

Apparently blue moon ice cream is an [actual thing.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Moon_(ice_cream)  Based on the fact these blends are usually pretty secretive, I'd say this definitely tastes blue and probably hits the realism mark well enough.  I'd recommend this either as a primary/almost solo flavor at 3.5-4.5%, and bump it down to about 2.5-3% if you want some more room for additional fruits or creams.\n\nInhale is sweet and fluffy. Not a lot of density, with a candy blueberry type of flavor.  No syrupy edge to this, it's a drier candy blueberry, almost like a blueberry pixie stick. Exhale has a slightly rounder blueberry flavor, still sweet, commerical, and \"blue\" but with a bit more depth to it. I get some light floral bitterness and a softer vanilla in the top notes. Solid, fluffy base, but doesn't have much dairy to it. More like a marshmallow than ice cream. If this is indeed an ice cream, I'd peg it closer to a sherbet than anything else. Some lingering artificial tasting bitterness, actually pretty accurate to something pretty heavily dyed.\n\n**Off-flavors:** There's a bit of a bitter chemical edge to the blueberry in here.  FWIW, it seems to largely steep out, but you may be looking at 3-4 weeks to get rid of it entirely.  Some incredibly haphazard tests in a microwave seem to bear that out.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light.  That blueberry tastes a bit chemical and the dryness at higher percentages is a bit rough.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:** As an accent, seems like a good way to add some commercial blueberry sweetness to creams and bakeries. it's technically an ice cream, but it's not really super rich and eggy, so it should sort of add a blue tint to whatever you're adding it to.\n\nUsed as a primary flavor, obviously this could be used for a blueberry ice cream.  I'd want to add a richer ice cream behind it, like your VBIC of choice or HS Ice Cream.  I think it would also do a good job of working as a blueberry milkshake base, with more realistic blueberry concentrates filling in some of that \"blue\" noise.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, this is kind of chemical and underflavored at 1%.  2% is a bit more solid, with more of a \"blue\" marshmallow kind of feel to it overall. Not a lot of richness down this low, but it's usuable as an accent flavor.  3% is starting to come together pretty nicely, with the ice cream part of this filing out a bit and the \"blue\" part sweet but not overwhelming. 4% is just a bit heavier overall. Hasn't really gotten any richer, but it's heavier and a clearer flavor. 5% is a bit intense and dry. I'm getting some chemical bitterness up this high, and it's a bit sweet for me.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nI can't find anything on the SC version of this, so these are all for the VG Version. YMMV, of course.\n\n[ECF post about this, User \"Ceejay0875\" says: \" Very fruity, mostly blueberry but you can definitely taste the orange, I think it's a solid blend of the two.\"](https://www.e-cigarette-forum.com/forum/threads/real-flavors-blue-moon-ice-cream.782455/)\n\n[The ELR page for the VG version.

H/T of the day goes to /u/ID10-T (as if he needed more recognition) for suggesting this one.  My testing procedure for the Real Flavors Super Concentrate stuff is going to be largely identical to everything else, but I'm using the bounds of the mixing range specified on the bottle as my mixing range. i suspect some of these will be pretty low after trying a couple, but for the first batch I'm kind of locked into these percentages for the steeped samples. I'll try to provide a general usage guideline like usual though.",

These flavors really do need at least a 4 week steep to fully develop the flavors. VG just doesn't carry the flavor like PG.

And I know that blue raspberry slushy probably tastes nothing like the real fruit, I have no clue. But this tastes very much like a blue raspberry slushy. Without being sickening sweet, nor artificial. I need to order Koolada. I bet it would take this over the top for summer. I've always been a custard and dessert vaper, so not sure where to go with it. It's very good, just a bit out of my comfort zone. Will have to find my imagination for this one. Is a bright medium sweet berry, very different from all the usual berries when you want something to break the monotony.\n- At a 4 week steep. This has gotten noticeably sweeter, and raspberry has moved a little more to the front. This is less slush now that it has steeped, and maybe more rancher candy now? Maybe because of the sweetness. Either way, it's very good. I'm working a white chocolate blue razz cheesecake with this right now, no clue how it will turn out. Thinking blue raspberries & cream too? Need my imagination to kick into gear :(\n",

I’m getting the realistic dark berry notes upfront with a sweet macerated blueberry throughout the exhale. It’s not sugary per se but it has that baked taste like the ‘blueberry’ in a Lil Debbie’s blueberry muffin. Not a very dense flavor and lacking in body (mainly getting top and bottom notes).\n\n**Off-flavors**: Nothing really, no fruit peels or anything like that. \n\n**Throat hit**: Smooth, little to none.\n\n**Uses**: I’m sticking this in muffin recipes right at 2-3% so that it stands up to whatever else I throw at it. This is not like FW blueberry and the closest thing I could say would be FA bilberry. This is like a slightly brighter bilberry to me, so I’d use also where you might use that but don’t want such a dark berry flavor.\n\n\n**Pairings**: Other berries (especially other blueberries, blackberry or raspberry), fruits (apples, pears, orange, peach, pineapple, rhubarb, banana and watermelon), creams, custards, cinnamon, nuts especially almond, honey, ginger\n\n**Notes**: I have not worked extensively with this and I’m not sure which other blueberry I want to join with this one (to add body) but I am leaning toward CAP blueberry 1-2% + RF blueberry 1-2% for bakery stuff, custards and blueberry blends. I think this one will need help standing up to heavier stuff like TPA VBIC or CAP VC. I’d keep the creams lighter, maybe stuff w/o diketones like FLV cream or FA Vienna/fresh. \n\nThis is not the answer to blueberry struggles but it is a nice flavor and I gotta say I prefer it to FW or CAP standalone just because it is not tiring to vape on. Edit: take this with a grain of salt, I just can't enjoy blueberry for too long before it tires my sense out, especially the very candy/jammy artificial ones.\n\n**Second Opinions**\nLimited notes about the VG version on [ELR](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/80766)\t\n\nNot too much out there but if you have had the RF blueberry muffin this is the same blueberry without the muffin.\n\nEdit: deleted repeated shit ",

On the dry side, overall. Doensn't really come across as a liquid.  I think mixing with this is going to be a bit difficult, but I maybe see some use in backing up a cleaner brandy flavor like Flavourart's version or in more savory cooked grape or maybe even fig applications.  I'd use this at around 1.5-2.5%.\n\nInhale is sharp and sweet. More authentic brandy up top, with a pretty heavily sweet candy grape base. Moderately dense overall, with a dryer mouthfeel. Exhale starts pretty accurate as you get that almost raisiny brandy richness up front with some dirtier fermentation notes up top. That candy grape sweetness shows up big in the tail end of the exhale and seems to clash a bit with the more realistic take up front.  It's almost like someone rolled a grape jolly rancher in powdered brandy? As odd as that that sounds. The alcohol note has a kind of artificial chemical edge to it.  Almost like a cheaper brandy, but those hairspray notes get fairly prominent and linger quite a bit.  Moderate density overall, but the mouthfeel is fairly dry for a liquid.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  The sweetness here just doesn't gel with the rest of the concentrate. I get a grape candy sweetness sitting behind the more traditional brandy. I also feel like the mouthfeel is a bit on the dry side for a liquid, and that \"alcohol\" has a hairspray chemical edge to it.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Light to moderate. That alcohol note tastes a bit off, chemical, and harsh.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I don't necessarily think is a slam dunk for a brandy flavor to use in cocktails. I'd use this to add some funk back into FA Brandy, which is tasty but doesn't bear much resemblance to alcohol.\n\nI could also see this being used to add some realism to dark grape or grape juice flavors.  I think the big challenge there would be to get all the the flavors to really hang together and cohere, but .5% TPA Dragonfruit would help to emulsify it all.\n\nThis is pretty dry, but it could work to add some raisiny oomph to drier bakeries, like a cinnamon raisin bread or something similar.\n\n**Notes:**  At 1%, this is mostly just sweet and grape-y. I'm missing a lot of the more interesting brandy here, and it's just a sweet, flat, slightly dry dark grape flavor. 1.5% has a bit more depth. Still dry, and fairly flat but I'm starting to get some brandy here. 2% is pretty solid, with the grape sweetness not entirely overbearing, and the brandy getting a richness in flavor but the alchol is starting to get a bit sharp and artificial. 2.5% is about my usuable limit. The sweetness is a bit much, and that alchol note is getting too bitter. 3% is too much, too sweet, too fermented, and the alchol is too chemical.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Some of the finest independent research on the subject.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVx8L7a3MuE)\n\n[Here's the product page from Real Flavors.

It's not a scientific test by any means, but I set up some coffee filters and put a drop of this and FA Cocoa on there to see if they asorb.  The FA Cocoa absorbed, stained the hell out of the filter, but it absorbed within 30 seconds.

I'm getting burnt notes off of this on the first drag at 2 and 4%. Even at .25%, I'm getting like 2 drags max before it tastes markedly burnt. Dry burning the coil afterwards, there is something heavily gunking them up.\n\nWith all that said, it definitely tastes like brown sugar before it tastes like burning.

This is a very good strength at 1.5% at 3 days. If the flavor strengthens with a longer steep, I might have to reduce it to 1%, but it's great at 3 days. I made the mistake of mixing the first batch of this with sweetener, thinking of those “other” chocolates I had tried. It was sickening, had to dump and remake. I recommend trying without sweetener first, then start small if you want more sweetness. Tastes and smells exactly like the name. Imagine you have just stirred that mix with 50 spoon strokes, then scraped the batter into the pan. Then you use your finger to clean the bowl of that delicious, rich, gooey, chocolaty goodness. And it's not that weak chocolate brownie mix, oh noooo. This is the deluxe Fudge Brownie Mix batter. So this and rich you can practically feel it coating your tongue mmmmmmmm. Oh, ummmm, where was I at?\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOh yes, it really is that good. Just buy it. Sweet, fudgy, chocolaty, uncooked brownie batter. Nice thick mouth feel even at 3 days. I can honestly say this is the first chocolate flavor I have found that I like. My only caveat would be that this is so realistic and rich that I can't ADV it. Gets sickening after a while, just like if you have really eaten too much batter. It's been great for around 3 hours at a time, or whenever I get a sweet tooth. And with coffee, definitely with coffee. I will update at the 4 week steep.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Steep Time:** 4 Week\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAt a 4 week steep, this has weakened and had flavor loss similar to what lemon does. I still get the brownie flavor, but it's not as strong and has lost that fudgy rich flavor and the thick mouth feel is completely gone. I am going to skip this right up to 3%, which means it will be way too strong before steeping. But testing to see if it can hold on to more flavor with a steep. Otherwise, this would make an incredible S&V after 24 hours. I wouldn't make more than a week's worth or so at a time, so as to not lose that realistic fudgy richness that makes this flavor so good during the first week.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAt a 3-7 day steep I would rate this 5 stars as it's perfect, and this will probably be one I keep as a S&V. At a 4 week steep I would give it 3, unless the stronger percentage helps hold the flavor. It still tastes good and like brownie batter, but a weaker version compared to how gooey and intense it is in that first week.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nEDIT: Real Flavors has announced they will be changing the names of their Raw Extracts to Super Concentrates.",

Relatively little oak in the top notes here, but there is a bright alcoholic heat up there.  Gets a bit buttery on top of that overripe fruit note, and picks up a bit of a rancid note. I think it's fairly accurate to cheap whiskey, but it apparently gives some people fits as its similar to FW Whiskey. Overall texture on this is a bit smoother, and wetter, so I don't think it'll end up picking up that kibble note that people complain about with FW Whiskey.  Actually a fairly clean finish for all of the of the funky stuff happening here.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  That cheap whiskey buttery-almost rancid note is pretty strong here. I don't find it super offensive myself, but I know that's it pretty offputting for people who want a cleaner, more subtle whiskey flavor. I'd also say this is desperately missing oak for a more authentic bourbon.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Moderate, but it seems pretty appropriate for something based on alcohol.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Cocktails! Whiskey cocktails!  I don't think this will be the kind of whiskey concentrate that is primarily good for making things taste baked.  I think you're pretty well stuck using this like you would an actual whiskey.\n\nI'd personally suggest dressing this up a bit with some FLV Bourbon for the oak note, although you could use TFA Red Oak or FA Oakwood as well.  With that apple note in there, I think this could also back up FA Whisky, which is more of a sweet scotch.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration wise, it seems like these Real Flavors SC actually have a minimum mixing percentage, which is pretty interesting. They just don't cohere until you hit a high enough concentration. 1% on this is a bit disjointed. I get most of the components, but it doesn't really cohere into a full flavor and I've got a weird chemical note. 2% is noticeably better, it's a pretty aggressive flavor, and it's a bit hot on the alcohol, which is kind of nice for a bourbon. 3% is noticeably fruitier, with that apple note coming out fairly strong, but still overall pretty good for a cheap whiskey. 4% is too fruity and a bit too buttery for me. I'd recommend using this between 2-3%\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nNot a whole lot, even on the VG Version.\n\n[Here's the product page from Real Flavors.  Their take: \"Historically used for medicinal purposes, bourbon is a strong American whiskey. A complex spirit containing hundreds of flavor compounds, it develops a reddish color and a rich, woody taste as it matures. The best bourbons spend years aging in charred oak barrels…now you can have the same special taste as you please, without the wait or the hangover.\"](http://www.realflavors.com/shop/bourbon-super-concentrate/)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**\n\nH/T to /u/ID10-T for the suggestion.",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** RF SC Butter Crisp Candy Bar Type @ 2% and 4%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 16 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Tastes like smelling a butterfinger wrapper. I'm to the point where there is either a problem with my palate, or the way these flavors are built in relation to the way I'm vaping them. I'm not sure how people are getting full flavors out of these concentrates.  From what I do taste, there's more of the inside of a butterfinger, Some nutty, medium caramel notes with some grit to it, but kind of watery overall. Some lighter milk chocolate notes toward the end of the exhale.  More like one of the [butterfinger ice cream bars](https://www.drumstick.com/nestle/bars-butterfinger.aspx), then a normal butterfinger candy bar. If you get a fuller flavor out of this, it's pretty close to a one-shot butterfinger flavor, with maybe some additional milk chocolate flavor.  I can also see it working in other candy-bar type application but that butterfinger flavor is kind of distinctive.  I'd probably use it around 3%, assuming you get a bit more out of this flavor than I do.\n\nInhale is airy, mostly buterfinger filling. Good nutty note, and it has that darker, crispy flavor down pretty well if not actually the texture.  Sweet, but insubstantial. Exhale has that filling note up front. Again, hard to get much further than \"butterfinger\" flavor. Medium roasted peanuts, darker crispy tasting caramel, but still pretty distinctly butterfinger. I'm getting some good roasted peanut top notes out of this, but there it tastes like it should be crispy, but has an insubstantial airy mouthfeel instead of a solid crisp. Overall effect is creamy, but like cheap ice cream creamy bordering on watery. Tail end of the exhale is really airy but I get a milk chocolate there, with some black pepper off notes. Milk chocolate is definitely taking a back seat. Seems low for an accent, even for a butterfinger where it's more about the filling. Mouthfeel is airy and light, but cranking up the percentage just makes the entire thing taste chemical and off, with even more black pepper. Sweetness level is okay, but it doesn't really stick around. Lingering bitterness.\n\n**Off-flavors:** I get the dreaded black pepper out of this. Subtle at 2%, pretty prominent at 4%. TFA White Chocolate, VBIC, and now Butter all taste like straight black pepper to me, so YMMV.\n \n**Throat Hit:**  Moderate. Pretty standard throat hit with a good deal of harshness.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:** I'm not going to be using this for vaping, but the second opinion I found makes me think that may work for some people. If it does work for you, it's pretty much a one shot at 3%. The filling taste here is pretty distinctly \"butterfinger,\" so due to a lack of imagination I'm not coming up with too many other uses. You could theoretically try throwing in some torrone or additional caramel to switch up the type of candy bar, but you're still looking at candy bar vapes.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, I can't find a percentage where this works for me. 1% is light, mostly like smelling someone eating a butterfinger next to you. Mostly just the crisp part, with some nuttyness and darker caramel. 2% is a bit better, but still thin. I get a pretty clear, if light butterfinger crisp note, with just a hint of milk chocolate towards the end. Light peppery taste to that chocolate.  3% has more crisp body. Doesn't really taste crunchy at all, but you get some of the richness you'd want from the filling. Milk chocolate is still way back in the mix, but I'm getting more pepper. At 4% that filling is getting kind of bitter and sharp, and I'm getting a noticeable helping of black pepper on the chocolate note.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nNot a ton of info I can find.\n\n[Review from \"SessionDrummer\" on the ELR Forum.

Having JUST finished tested the condensed milk (wow, that's a TOUGH act to follow), this one is also very good. The butterfinger/butter crisp flavors come through quite nicely, with nothing overpowering, but a very buttery, crispy, slight chocolately mix. Nice and rich, without any off notes, or issues. I have never vaped a butter crisp (butterfingers) flavor before, but this one sure tastes good, and accurate. Chocolate is VERY hard to get right, and although it's not the main flavor here, what they came up with is very nice. Very solid 9/10, with maybe only 1 taken off, JUST because it didn't hit me QUITE as hard as the CM did, but a very good flavor.\"\n\n[Here's the product page from Real Flavors.

However, even using higher percentages, if they are single flavors it's not using any more flavoring than they usual 15-20% of combines flavors that is commonly used with a lot of flavoring. These are not super concentrated like INW or FA.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Butterscotch Pudding**\n\n- At 10% @ 1 week steep. Slightly weak, but very good and sweet. Creamy sweet butterscotch dominant at this point, creamy back note. Not really getting an \"instant pudding\" type flavor at this point, but it's still early. Nice thick mouth feel. Almost like a creamy rich butterscotch candy. Could easily be a stand alone with proper steep I think. Will try again at 4 weeks. I think with normal steeping times that creamy aspect will really strengthen, and will move more in the pudding direction. Right now I would say 10-12% tank 8-10% dripper for single flavor, 4-6% in blends. Will update with further testing. I really really like this, having  a hard time putting it down.\n- At a 4 week steep. AMAZING! Straight up (insert famous maker here) butterscotch  Instant Pudding! Nothing like the other butterscotches or the ice cream syrup. This has matured wonderfully, I am going to start with 12-15% stand alone for tanks. Must get more!!!!

Lighter buttery cream and blonde caramel.  I feel like a broken record with these RF SC flavors, but It's a good flavor, I just want more and I'm getting some structural issues. I'm getting a bit of throat hit, not so much a harsh bite but like a lingering heartburn kind of sensation. In the second opinions someone mentions a \"tickle\" in the throat, and that's a fairly decent description. A bit more linear than some of the other real flavors, Light but noticeable at 1%, and more solid by like 3%, although that weird harshness is getting pretty pronounced. I'd maybe use this as a backup for a butterscotch or caramel to stick behind a darker, dryer concentrate.\n\nInhale is buttery up front, but manages to be pretty airy.  Building blonde caramel sweetness, getting a bit sharp if you really push that inhale. eventually picking a bit of a citric sour edge. I'm not really noticing it unless we are talking really deep draws, but I feel like it's there. Exhale has a softer, buttery caramel. More like a butterscotch candy than a crispy, tarker toffee you'd get in a candy bar. Flavor falls off pretty sharply in the exhale.  Feels a bit watery by the time you hit the tail end.  Sweet, but insubstantial overall.  I'm still getting just a bit of that weird citric tartness as opposed to a a full, buttery, creamy flavor.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Thin, and a bit sour. Pretty blah by the time you hit the end of the vape.\n \n**Throat Hit:**  Odd. Not like stinging harsh, but kind of like heartburn, especially after some prolonged vaping.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  It's a buttery caramel-esque type of flavor lacking body, so it's hard to find a clear use for this. I could see it backing up dryer sharper caramel and butterscotch flavors like the FLV and FA Caramel and Butterscotches. If you don't get the weird thinness from these RF SC flavors, then the world is your oyster.  A buttery caramel will fit in tobaccos, bakeries, and even fruit mixes.\n\n**Notes:**  This is fairly linear. I think 1% is pretty light, but usable. More like a hint of butter. Caramel isn't really coming in clear and it doesn't feel thick enough for a toffee or full candy-style vape. 2% is a bit more solid. Caramelized sugar coming through a bit clearer, and there's more of full candy flavor. Still feels markedly thin on the tail end of the exhale. 3% is too different from 2%. Maybe a stronger butter, and heavier caramel at least up front. 4% is getting kind of weirdly harsh and sour. 5% just tastes sour and strange. I'd use this around 2-3%, if you don't run into the thinness issue.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Here's the ELR for the SC Version.  Two notes of note, really.  One says it's barely there after a month @ 3%, and one just complains it's harsh but praises the flavor. I come down more in the \"barely there\" camp, but I see the throat hit.]( http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/127943)\n\n[And here's the ELR for the VG Version. Common complaint that this weak.

Kind of like CAP Jelly Candy, with less of a jellied vibe and some marshmallow stuck in there as well.  \n\nI can't really peg to this a specific type of candy, but it seems to thin out, fluff up, and add a bit of bitterness to whatever it's mixed with.  It actually doesn't seem to sweeten the added concentrate all that noticeably.  I'd stick to using this to thin and fluff out mixtures, especially those involving syrupy fruits. I got better results at 1% than higher, so I'd probably start at .5% and work up from there.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Solo, not really. It doesn't really taste like \"candy\" by itself, but there's nothing aggressive or \"bad\" tasting. Mixed, this really seems to push a non-chemical but still pretty odd bitterness up in the other concentrates it's mixed with.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Solo, Light.  Sweetness is just a bit dry and slightly harsh.  Mixed, I don't really notice any increased throat hit.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I've mixed up my usual candy-type base testers with this.\n\n**1% RF SC Candy Base, 2% DIYFS Holy Vanilla:** Getting a lot of marshmallow out of this. The texture here does seem to be pushing everything towards a ligher, fluffier mouthfeel while the vanilla seems to be a bit thinner than usual, but still very present. Also seems to be pushing some light, slightly artificial tasting bitterness up toward the front of the mix. Based on this test, I'd say it'll take creams more toward marshmallow than anything else. Definitely present at 1%.\n\n**2% RF SC Candy Base, 3% FW Root Beer**  This is a bit odd. Spice notes from the root beer seem to be dialed back quite a bit.  Texture is fluffy, but the flavor seems to be a bit thin and almost watery. Same kind of artificial bitterness as was present in the holy vanilla test, but obviously a bit more intense. Strangely unsatisfying in the way it's thinning out the root beer.\n\n**3% RF SC Candy Base, 4% OSDIY Blue Raspberry Slush**  Again, big fluffy volume, but a muted, thinner flavor from the added concentrate, and a kind of bitter sour note overall.  I'm missing most of the Juicyness from the Blue Raspberry Slush and getting watery instead. Mostly just makes me not want to vape Blue Raspberry Slush.\n\nBased on these tests, I'd pretty much stick to using this at a low percentage with juicier, syrupy fruits to lighten them up and dial back the wetness there.  I think there are some niche applications with creams in general, but it's going to make your cream into more of a marshmallow flavor.\n\n**Notes:**  This seems to be fairly strong when mixed, of the tests the most pleasant was definitely 1%, but even that is a bit overbearing. I'd start at .5% and work up.\n\nI'm interested to see how this compares to their taffy base, so I'll try that one tomorrow.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nNot really, unfortunately.\n\n[Here's the product page from Real Flavors.

There's something odd going on in the backend of this, almost a musty, slightly soapy cardboard note, but I don't find it really overwhelming.  Even more promising, I'm not getting any burned notes or coil gore while vaping this. Because of that cardboardy note, I'd avoid mixing this with fruits and creams, but I think it'll work better with dryer applications like bakeries and tobaccos. I'd mix with this between 2-3%.\n\nInhale is medium dense, with a sharper lightly caramelized sugar sweetness and a sort of fluffy base with just a bit of cream to it but a lot of conspicuously neutral body.  Exhale starts off really strong, with a slightly buttery caramel up front without any kind of harsh burnt notes. Initially a creamy texture to this, and a wholly appropriate but not overwhelming level of sweetness. Back of the exhale gets a bit weird, as the caramel flavor dies down but you've still got a lot of volume that doesn't have much flavor to it. You've also got a bit of a musty, earthy note and some lighter soapy flavor right towards the tail end. Not a super dense, just a bit airier than I'd like from a caramel, but the finish is relatively clean, with just a bit of that soapy aftertaste lingering.\n\n**Off-flavors:** All in the back half of the exhale. The caramel flavor tails off pretty sharply, so you're left with some cardboardy volume that picks up some earthiness and a bit of a soap on the tail end. Soapy sounds bad, but I get it in a lot of caramel flavors, and it really isn't that extreme in comparison to some other options.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Not really.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Despite the weirdness on the back end of this, this may actually be worth playing with. Most of the caramels on the market are either drier, darker, and grittier or they're an absolute nightmare of coil gunk.  This has neither of those issues.  This also tastes more cohesive than you'd get from just mixing a cream with on of the grittier caramels.\n\nI'd say this is a caramel primarily for bakeries and tobaccos. The weirdness on the back end has some fluffier texture to it, and those soapy notes aren't terribly strong and should be covered up pretty easily by heavier flavors.\n\nI'd personally avoid it for creams and fruits, as I've found those cardboardy notes do weird things to creams and brighter fruits... but you don't have a ton of other options there for softer caramels so you could definitely do worse.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, this seems to have a drier, darker caramel to it at 1%. I'm getting some gritiness, and that creamy part of this hasn't really come in clearly. I'm also get a bit more soap out of this, which is weird to happen at a lower percentage, but here we are. 2% is better overall, that caramelized sugar note has softened a bit, and I'm getting more richness out of the caramel here at least up front, with some legit buttery cream notes. I'm also starting to pick up that flat cardboard towards the back of the vape. 3% is a bit more aggressive, still has some richness up front but that cardboard volume towards the back is getting more earthy than soapy and picking up a bit of a savory edge. 4% seems like too much, The front end of this is still okay, but the back end is getting fairly earthy and a bit bitter.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[ELR page for the SC version is actually more helpful than the VG version.  User \"Kotsos\" says \"Mostly artificial caramel syrup, nothing that will blow your mind or really help your recipes. Stick with TPA or FA.\" User \"juice junkie lover\" has a more negative take with \"Mixed at 2.5% and let it sit a week. Oh man I get the sweaty sock taste from this flavor. I can taste notes of a thick caramel but that chemical is back and I taste this earthy mushroom, sweaty sock kind of flavor.\"  User \"Lolly\" reports that at \"1% this is a delicious caramel, not candy like, more like the gooey caramel you get inside a chocolate bar. Happily vape this on its own! \" but says they can't really taste it at 3%.  So all over the place really. I tend to sort of split the difference here. I could see people complaining about the off notes on the backend, but the front end of this is actually solid for a softer caramel, so much so I'd mix around the weirdness at the end.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/126003)\n\n[Here's the product page from Real Flavors.

I feel like it's mostly the apple here, although that flat volume from the caramel does a lot to smooth it out. Over 3%, it starts to get dry and weird.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:** There's a lot going on here, and it seems like it will be pretty hard to really mix around.  I'd probably run with the caramel apple sucker thing, and just try to clean up the flavor a bit. I feel like a juicier apple like FA/JF Fuji or FLV Apple Pop would help to really fill out that apple note. It'll still be candy, but a bit fuller and more satisfying. The backend of the caramel is still a bit lacking for me, so I'd maybe look to a heavier cream to kind of pull the flavor back a bit and emulsify it over the entire exhale. My gut would be something like FLV Cream at .25-.5%.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, this isn't really clicking for me at 1%. I feel like the caramel and the apple aren't really stuck together and the whole business is just a bit thin. 2% is better, I still think the apple is a bit thin, but the caramel and apple are cohering a bit better, and the caramel hasn't gone full cardboard on me.  3% is probably my sweet spot. Candy apple is pretty full, and the caramel is thick without being too weird on the tail end of the exhale. 4% is a bit dry on the exhale and the apple is a bit harsh. I'd recommend mixing with this at about 2% if you're punching up the caramel and the apple, and maybe 3% if you're just rolling with it solo.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Only one note on ELR, and it's on the VG Version. User \"Brian_SFL\" says \"Green Apple, meh caramel. More candied than I was hoping for.\"](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/80780)\n\n[Here's the product page from Real Flavors.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** RF SC Carrot @ 2% and 4%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 20 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Big unpeeled carrots.  On my initial tests I was getting a sweeter flavor, but sitting down with it I'd definitely say it leans more earthy than sweet.  The sweetness that is here is pretty good. Nice baked carrot sweetness. Pretty intensely earthy, harsh note on top of that though. Carrot doesn't really start taste fresh until about 3%, but by 4% it tastes a bit too earthy. Almost like a bigger, older unpeeled carrot.  I don't really think this is holy-grail missing bakery carrot for a carrot cake flavor, but I can see some interesting use of this playing against brighter fruit flavors.\n\nInhale is airy and earthy. Greener, astringent earthiness with a bit of a pepper bite. Again, like the skin on a big, older carrot. Some of that orange carrot sweetness in the base, but pretty far back behind the earthy carrot skin note. Exhale is again a bit airy. Same kind of earthiness, with a bit more of that peppery bite in the top notes. Carrot sweetness in the back end of the exhale. Pretty realistic, but pretty subtle compared to that big earthy note. Mouthfeel is a bit unsatisfying.  Way too airy, and I'm getting a good deal of harshness out of this. Overall sweetness level actually seems a bit too low.  I like the carrot that I'm tasting here, I just want a thicker, sweeter base.\n\nAlso worth noting, this has a whole lot sediment to it. I didn't notice any issues with burning or coil gore until about 5ml into my 4% test, but the concentrate definitely separates into a clear top half and cloudy bottom half when it sits. Shaken, it seems to stay in suspension fairly well, but it's opaque like apple cider.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  The earthy note is really prominent to the point of being off-puttingly dirty tasting. It's also not an off-flavor per se, but this is pretty thin and insubstantial in terms of mouthfeel.  Thinness goes away a bit with some extra heat, but there's a tradeoff with more harshness and some straight dirt on that earthy note.\n \n**Throat Hit:**  Moderate to Harsh. The earthiness is a bit rough and the thin mouthfeel isn't helping.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Not the carrot cake silver bullet. I could see maybe sticking this into bakeries at a low percentage, but I don't think it really captures the intense sweetness of the carrot in carrot cake.\n\nI do think this could see some use in more abstract ways. A lot of fruit juice blends use some carrot for health-cred and earthy contrast. I'd consider mixing with this citrus (especially orange) or something like blueberries and pomegranate. I don't feel like this really has the body to pull off a primary note in a mix, so I'd use it lower as an accent around 1.5-2%.  Use would be similar to something like Rhubarb up against red berries.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, I'm getting mostly a light earthy note. Not too much harshness, but not a whole lot of flavor either. 2% doesn't really taste like a fresh carrot, but I'm getting a bit more of the carrot sweetness. Earthy taste is still pretty dominant and I'm getting some clear harshness. 3% is about as high as I'd go with this. Skin forward carrot, but it's a fairly full flavor.  Still pretty harsh. 4% is getting too dirty and spicy, even for a carrot.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nNot really.\n\n[Here's the product page from Real Flavors.  Their take: \"The taste of carrots is a unique composition between sweet, fruity and more harsh or bitter flavors. This is a fun flavor to add to others to see what you can make. Some recipes need a bit of an earth taste. This is where you can get it!\"](http://www.realflavors.com/shop/rice-pudding-super-concentrate/)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**\n\nH/T to /u/ID10-T/ for the suggestion.\n\nI did my initial test of this (along with RF SC Tomato, and RF SC Sriracha) as part of an almost unbearably awkward youtube video located [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdgIT1PxYxw).  Getting into this a bit more, I'm getting less sweetness and more harshness. If you really want to see me vape and stare off into the middle distance while being puzzled, I'm not going to stop you.  This was my first attempt at a video review, so it's a bit rough (between the low volume level, rambling run time, and the resigned cursing) but I resisted the urge to redo it as you can only taste RF Sriracha for the first time once.",

It fades for me after the first couple of drags, and it fades hard leaving a kind of flat solid bakery note, without much going besides some lighter spice notes. This would be normally be the part where I'd point to the second opinions but I can't find any.\n\nSpice heavy carrot cake, with a frosting waxiness to the tail end of it.  I get a pretty clear sweetness from the carrot, and a darker cake base, more of a spice cake than yellow cake.  Spice note has a clear nutmeg taste with a bit of cinnamon spice to it. I don't taste a lot of frosting here, but I can definitely feel i towards the back end. I think this flavor needs a higher percentage to really come through, and even then everything but the spice note seems to be really fleeting and fade out quickly.  I'd sparingly accent this with some kind of nut and maybe a bit of frosting, but this is a pretty full concentrate when you're tasting all of it. I'd recommend starting with this all the way up at 5% as a primary note.\n\nInhale has a load of sharper nutmeg right up front in the top notes, with a flatter neutral bakery base. Exhale has a really nice daker sugar and carrot sweetness up front, with that nutmeg heavy spice in the top notes with just a bit of a cinnamon kind of bite to it.  You get the cake part of this on the back half of the exhale, with a bit more of a fluffy rather than dense texture.  I can feel the frosting towards the back, more of a waxy mouthfeel, rather than a clear frosting note.  Clean finish overall.  That's all based on the first couple drags of a redrip though. The cake base seems to hollow and the sweetness tapers off pretty quickly, leaving (for me at least) a kind of cardboard base with a light nutmeg to it.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Once you can find the carrot cake here, not really. It's pretty well hidden until you hit high percentages and even then it's pretty front-loaded and kind of elusive.\n\n**Throat Hit:** No.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  So the flavor here tastes okay, but it doesn't seem to work all that well for vaping. That front-loaded thing is kind of strange, and definitely limits the usefulness of this concentrate in mixing. I know nothing about chemistry, so this is probably wrong, but it feels like the volatiles here are too volatile.  Either that, or this is just burning out my palate super fast.\n\nIf I'm completely off-base, and this is just an issue with the way I'm tasting this, this is pretty close to a solo concentrate. From what I'm tasting, I don't really think this needs anything to read as a carrot cake. You've got cake, spice, carrot, and frosting all in there and I'm not sure what you'd want in here to accent the existing flavors. I think maybe this could use a bit of nuttiness, so maybe some walnut, FA Hazelnut, or TPA toasted almond, but that's about it.  You could also stand to accent the frosting a bit, either with some meringue for a lighter body or FLV Frosting for a more duncan-hines commercial frosting note.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, this seems super weak to me given the suggested 1-2.5% mixing range on the bottle. I basically can't taste it at 1-2%. I get some waxy frosting mouthfeel and a couple smaller bursts of spice, but there doesn't seem to be much here. 3% has a bit of a cake body to it, but it fades pretty quick, just a heavy lightly spiced volume after the first couple drags. 4% starts to pick up some carrot sweetness, and maybe more of a recognizable heavier cake flavor, but it's still definitely on the light side. 5% tastes okay for the first couple drags, with a darker spice cake base and some noticeable carrot and a more of a frosting mouthfeel than actual taste.  It does disappear on you really quick though, like the flavor is driven off during those first couple drags and then you're left with a really vague, heavy body.  6-8% tastes largely the same, maybe a bit more definition but still really fleeting in terms of flavor.  10% seems like too much, with a bitter chemical taste lingering way longer than the actual flavor. If you are going to be mixing with this, I'd go heavy, probably starting around 5% up to 8%.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Here's the product page from Real Flavors.

This is dark and really syrupy. And it stains. I'm pretty sure you could use this for prison tattoos. I'm not particularly squeamish about this kind of stuff, but even at 2% this makes for a spooky dark mix. 4% is almost black. I've vaped darker concentrates before (cough, FA Cocoa, TPA Kahlua and Cream, cough) but none of them had this weird kind of sticky, inky vibe to them.  I'm probably going to die.\n\nPersonally, this just tastes burnt to me. I can't find a percentage or temperature where this isn't just turning my coils wicks black and crusty. On the first drip on clean cotton, I get some black cherry kind of slightly medicinal flavor, and a kind of thin cola base in the background.  Definitely has that acid bite of real cola, but it doesn't do the burned notes any favors. Even just on the tail end of the first drag it tastes flat, bitter, and burned.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** RF SC Cherry Limeade @ 2% and 4%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 9 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Taste is Sonic-style cherry limeade, Like straight out of the fat-kid-special Route 44 jug of HFCS.   Brighter, sweet maraschino cherry type of cherry in here with some tarter limeade notes. I get just a slight bit of a medicinal taste nestled in there, but it's not too obtrusive and really only shows up when my wicks are absolutely soaked at 4%.  Nothing like an actual beverage made with cherries or limes, but I think it hits the profile fairly well. Texture needs some work, as it's a bit dry and harsh instead of wet and syrupy.  i'd use this as a primary note, and just do some smart accents on mouthfeel or maybe throw in some more realistic lime and berries. My recommend use percentage would be between 3-4%.\n\nInhale is has a bit of sharper lime up top, not really lime zest oil, but on the harsh and dry side, with some zest bitterness. Maraschino cherry base. Sweet, but a bit dry. Closer to like powdered bright red cherry koolaid rather than a maraschino cherry syrup. Exhale is really cohesive, it's hard really pulling the cherry and lime apart here, but they are both there. Very bright, commercial, cohesive cherry limeade flavor. Tastes like it has never seen an actual piece of fruit, but still satisfying in that trashy artificial way. Just a bit of a medicinal, bitter top note but it's not at all bad for something involving cherry.  Tarter lime notes in there, but no real lime juiciness or intense lime zest flavor. Sweet, but dry. Lacking some of the juiciness that would bring it into more of the straight soda syrup taste of Sonic cherry limeade.  Fairly clean finish. For something this sweet I'm not getting much in the way of sugar lips.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Just a bit of medicinal cherry cough drop, mostly in the top notes of the exhale. Having tried some other cherry flavors, it really isn't all that bad.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Moderate. I think the cherry and lime by itself is a bit harsh, and it's dryer overall which doesn't help.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Taste-wise, this is already pretty close to a cherry limeade. I don't think it needs too much supporting to hit the profile. It's a bit dry though, so I think it needs some kind of moisture or juicyness. I'd look at a small percentage of INW Cactus, or maybe 1-2% CAP Cucumber. It's also pretty sweet already, but those Sonic Cherry Limeades really are a complete sugar bomb, so maybe some sweetener is in order. I feel sucralose by itself isn't going to help much with that throat hit, so maybe a small percentage of EM or even TPA Sweetener.\n\nUsing this as a base for a more realistic cherry limeade, I think this could do with a bit more lime here, not so much to make it taste like lime zest but to give it some juicier body. I'd personally go with FA Aurora at about 1%, but I could see using FA Lime Distilled, or even FA Key Lime. If you wanted to amp up the berries a bit, I'd go with FA Blackcurrant or maybe FA Apricot if you wanted to really push the cherry thing and add some realism back. Alternatively, you could bring in one of the TPA Strawberries for some maltol, which should help smooth out the Cherry Limeade here.\n\nThis is dry enough it might also work as a base for cherry candies, as long as they handle the lime accent.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, 1% is just too light to do much. I get some flat cherry, some bitter lime but neither is all that fun. 2% is better, lime is a bit fuller, but I'm missing some of the crazy bright candy cherry. Still pretty dry and harsh. 3% isn't quite bright \"red\" but the cherry is noticeable and the concentrate is filling out a bit and getting some more body. 4% is pretty full on \"red\" and the cherry and the lime are getting hard to distinguish from each other. Sweet but not too cloying, sells the profile really well. 5% is getting a bit medicinal for me, with that cherry picking up more medicinal bitter notes up top and fairly harsh overall. 6% is robotussin with a lime twist. I'd use this at 3% if you want to build around it for a limeade, and 4% if you just want to deal with some of the mouthfeel issues.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Here's the ELR page for the VG version. Not much but user \"nfy\" reports: \"At 8% it has a good cherry and a decent lime, tastes like it should. I do wish it had a little more sour or lime to it but it is decent as is.\"  They have a point, this would really well with some FA Sour Wizard.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/80784)\n\n[User \"jombo\" on ECF gives the ringing endorsement of \"pretty good\" on an ECF post on what I'm guessing is the VG version.](https://www.e-cigarette-forum.com/forum/threads/real-flavors.759571/page-2)\n\n[Here's the product page from Real Flavors.

There seems to be a very tiny bit of a vanilla note as well.

More like cookie crisp cereal than a more solid full bakery flavor. Clear, but pretty restrained chocolate note pushing chemical at higher percentages, and a thinner base without much texture. Even at higher percentages I'm missing a lot of richer, deeper flavors out of this.  Barring some sort of cookie crisp cereal vape, I'd have trouble using this as a full cookie, and i'm not sure if it brings enough of a bridge to really count as vital in building a flavor around.  Flavor seems to come together at 2% and tops out by 3%.\n\nInhale is mostly sharp, chemical chocolate. It builds as you inhale though, as opposed to being all up front. Moderately dense up top, but airy in the base with maybe some light, flat cookie notes.  Exhale has a clearer, if still light cookie taste right up front and the chocolate here is pretty well balanced. Back of the exhale kind of falls apart a bit, and that chocolate kind of builds up in the back of my throat and gets a bit harsh. Not particularly sweet, dense, or rich. Like vaping the air from a box of cookie crisp.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Texture-wise, this doesn't line up with what I want out of a bakery vape.  It's thin and kind of insubstantial. That chocolate note also gets chemical and bitter up towards 3%.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Exhale has a bit of sting on the back of the throat from that chocolate. Moderate?\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I'm struggling a bit with this one. There's simultaneously a lot going on, none of it is really noteworthy, and there isn't a lot of body behind any of it.\n\nI don't get enough texture to use as a texturizer for softer bakeries.  That chocolate note is a bit thin, weird, and artificial and so I wouldn't use it to just add chocolate to a mix. There's not a deeper richness to butter up other bakeries.\n\nI think to use it as a chocolate chip cookie, you'd need a cookie base, and chocolate, and you might as well leave this out because it doesn't do either of those all that well.\n\n**Notes:**  This is fairly non-existent at 1%, kind of smelling stale chocolate chip cookies. 2% has a clearer, sharp kind of chocolate chip taste to it, but there isn't much bakery underneath. 2.5% has that same chocolate chip taste, but I can already taste it getting a bit bitter and chemical. Some body, but it's really cardboard-y. Not really rich or crunchy, it's just there. 3% has an even more aggressive chemical note to the chocolate, and the body isn't really doing anything for me. 4% is pretty distinctly bitter and chemical.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[ELR page for the VG Version, people are calling it weak at 10% in VG, which is pretty par for the course.

These are not super concentrated like INW or FA.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Coconut Cream Pie**\n\n- Tested 10% @ 1 week steep. This is a delicious, sweet, creamy, strong and authentic flavored coconut cream pie. Even at only 1 week steep, it's very well balanced to me. Great ratio of crust to creamy coconut filling, topped with thick layers of real whipped cream. I can easily see this as a stand alone ADV. Can't wait to taste this at 4 weeks, I really like this one. I can see it being changed very easily as well depending on what you are in the mood for. An extra touch of sweetened coconut, or pie crust. Or even a touch of graham cracker to change it to a graham crust. Maybe even pineapple for pineapple coconut pie? Or Pina Colada. Mmmmmm, so good!\n- At a 4 week steep. I'm even more in love with this. It will definitely be one of my ADVs. Still very well balanced, slightly sweeter, even more thick mouth feel. It has gotten more creamy and much deeper flavor. This might be my favorite. Maybe.\n\n**UPDATE:** I recommend only making enough to last up to 6 weeks at a time as I have found the flavor tends to fade quite a bit after that. Also bumping it up to 15-20% helps a little. ",

It's nice and sweet. And I absolutely hate it! Which is good for you, as I hate Coke. I have been a Diet Pepsi person my entire life. I can't even drink regular soda as to me it tastes like pure sugar. This tastes exactly like regular Coke. Not Pepsi, and we all know there is a difference. It is not effervescent, as that means fizzy and bubbly. And obviously it can't be that as it contains no carbonation. However, it doesn't have that overly sweet flat taste either. So it tastes like the real thing, just without the tingles. My husband loves it. He likes Coke. He wants me to make him a bottle of rum and coke, and vanilla coke, and cherry coke, and maybe lime coke. And he says maybe cherry vanilla coke. Which I will happily do as long as I don't have to vape it. I will not be updating this at a 4 week steep, blech. I will leave that to the other testers that actually like coke and let them talk about how a longer steep changes the strength/flavor.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Warning:**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis flavor separates extremely fast. Shake well and shake often and right before measuring. Even when trying to pull 1 ml up in a syringe to weigh it for gravity, I had to cap and shake again between every syringe full. Even though there was less than a minute in between drawing each syringe. It would weigh at 1.04g, then .79g. Then I'd shake and it would go back up to 1.05. Many times. When trying to weigh for gravity, I usually draw three 1ml syringes and use the number that comes up most, usually 2 of 3 times. This one I had to weight like 8 times and shake between each one before I got the same number a few times, so please go by your own SG on this one. And shake immediately before using. Also when putting it into the pg and vg in the flask, the flavoring stayed suspended in little black bubbles by themselves, they didn't dissolve. I was worried that it would keep separating after mixing. No worries, it blended fine with the frother, and seemed to stay blended after mixing. And it's very black. Like blended with the black rubber in the syringes so made it hard to see black. However, it didn't stain the syringes like I thought it would, but with longer exposure it might. I'm also not sure if that will affect how quickly your coils gunk either.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nEDIT: Real Flavors has announced they will be changing the names of their Raw Extracts to Super Concentrates.",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** RF SC Condensed Milk @ .25%, 2%, and 4%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 11 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Pretty straight ahead condensed milk taste up front, but some textural issues on the back end that kind of keeps this from clicking as a really thick, rich condensed milk. Good level of sweetness, with a ligher caramelized milk sugar character. Not a whole lot of aggressive dairy, but that's pretty accurate for condensed milk.  Starts out promising and medium-dense, but seems to thin out on the tail end of the exhale. I'd use maybe a wetter cream to fill this out for a good pastry cream or lighter custard, or keep it dry and use it for something like a pie filling. Concentration-wise, this is tricky. I get a good amount of actual flavor from this down as low as .25%, but it's all in the top notes. It tastes like condensed milk, but it really doesn't feel like condensed milk, if that makes any sense. At 2% I'm getting a good amount of mouthfeel, but i feel like it dries out substantially toward the back end. I'd recommend mixing with this at between .5-1.5% depending on how much mouthfeel you want to bring to the party.\n\nInhale is sweet and a bit dry. Some shaper brown-sugar / caramel notes up top but not a whole of flavor in the base. Pretty heavily sweet though, pretty natural tasting. Exhale opens up with the carmalized milk sugar note here, and it's really nice. Not too dark, with some buttery creamy base to it.  Back half of the exhale thins out substantially though.  At lower percentages it tastes watery, and at higher percentages it tastes dry. Sweetness level is dead on for condensed milk, and the mouthfeel up front is fairly thick and rich.  Finish is just a bit too clean, you'd expect this to a flavor that sticks to your palate, and this doesn't.\n\nWorth noting that this is super dark, but it's not sticky or inky.  I noticed no issues with coil gore.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Not really, flavor is pretty spot on. No weird maple note to this like bavarian creams.  Touch of caramel to this, but it's accurate to condensed milk. Flavor does seem to have a thin finish to it.\n \n**Throat Hit:** A bit, at 1% or under.  The tail end of the exhale is really dry. Gets noticeably harsher at 2%.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I'm primarily thinking this is going to be be better blended into cream bases than solo. I find that thinner mouthfeel on the tail end pretty distracting. I can see adding this to wetter creams like FA Fresh Cream, or FA Vienna Cream to add some buttery, sweet, richness up front and relying on the base cream to carry the finish.\n\nThe relative dryness here on the tail end means you can probably use this solo in bakeries to add some richness.  Real condensed milk makes it's way into stuff like pumpkin pie fillings and key lime pies, and that seems like a good use of this concentrate. You'll get richness without making your pastry notes soggy.  Almost reminds me of [FLV Custard](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/66cvsy/flv_custard/) in that way, but this is substantially richer, at least up front.\n\n**Notes:**  The concentration on this is tricky. This is definitely noticeable as a full flavor at .25%, but it seems really front-loaded at that percentage and it's pushing towards a watery after you get past the first burst of flavor. .5% is a bit thicker and less top note heavy, but I'm still missing some of that mouthfeel.  1% is drying out a bit, the condensed milk gets a bit more buttery, but i don't find the condensed milk is getting any kind of rancid or cheesy.  1.5% is rich up front and dry on the back end, but the flavor is really solid. 2% is getting a bit dry for me.  Good buttery, rich dairy and that caramel is picking up,  but the dryness on the backend is creeping into the front of the concentrate and getting a bit harsh. 4% still doesn't taste bad, but it's dry and a bit harsh. I'd use this as an accent for other creams around .5%, and as rich base for pastry fillings at  about 1.5%. \n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Here's /u/mysticrosell's review on the VG version.  I'm pretty much on the same page about this being thick and rich, at least at first, I tend to get some dryness at the end of this, but I tend to get a lot of dryness in general, and specifically from what I've tasted from the RF SC I've tried.  Also, a note that some of the caramelized milk flavor may fade out with a longer steep, which is kind of a bummer.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/4rhdol/rf_or_real_flavors_sweetened_condensed_milk_review/)\n\n[Good reviews for the VG Version on ELR](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/98365)\n\n[And even more positve reviews for the SC version on ELR. Suggested use percentage here is low, consensus between .25-5%.  I think there is plenty of flavor there, I'm just not wild about the watery mouthfeel underneath those top notes.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/111152)\n\n[Here's the product page from Real Flavors.  Their take: \"Condensed milk is sugar-sweetened cow’s milk where about 60% of the water has been removed. The thick, rich result has a sweet, creamy taste all its own that we can’t get enough of.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** RF SC Cookie Dough @ 2% and 4%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 17 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** So, right when I'm ready to give up on the RF Super Concentrates line, this is pretty okay.  Chocolate chip cookie dough.  A good amount of vanilla in here, but pretty accurate if still just a bit dry, light, and with a chemical edge to the back end and some strange harshness. Chocolate is light here, but it's there. Doesn't really taste like discrete chocolate chips, but that's probably an unrealistic expectation.  Less chocolate to it than FLV Cookie Dough, but the base is similar, maybe FLV is a bit more rich and buttery.  Tastes quite a bit more like chocolate chip cookies than RF SC Chocolate Chip Cookies, probably would work for a full chocolate chip cookie with a bit more texture and butter.  For a cookie dough, I'd want more richness and maybe some grit from brown sugar / butterscotch ripple (stealing that from /u/matthewkocanda/ on Beginner Blending before it was BLND) I'd recommend using this around 2-3%.\n\nInhale is dry and a bit airy.  Cookie dough flavor is there, but it's a bit thin.  Kind of like the cookie dough chunks in cheap ice cream. Mostly a vanilla flavor, without much richness to back it up. Sweetness isn't overwhelming, and it's pretty fleeting. Doesn't seem to really stick to your palate. Exhale is cookie dough up front. Largely similar to the exhale, but the vanilla isn't as dominant. You get a bit of texture but it's more just uniformly dry than really gritty. Some richer, eggier taste but not much attendant richer mouthfeel. Vanilla is mostly in the top notes here. Chocolate comes out in the back end of the exhale. Sort of a dry milk chocolate note.  A bit harsh, but fairly subtle. More like cocoa powder in the dough than discrete chocolate chips. Chemical edge on the back end, and I'm getting a good amount of harsh bitterness. That bitterness lingers quite a bit, and the dryness is a little rough.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Back end of this tastes a bit bitter and chemical. I think it's probably tied into the chocolate flavor, but it could be the carrier. I also feel like this is missing some richness. It's not as flat as some of the other RF SC flavors, but I really want something more out of this. \n \n**Throat Hit:**  Moderate. I get some harshness toward the back end. More of that heartburn-ish type of harshness than a straight pg throat hit.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Pretty close to a good cookie dough flavor, with some structural issues. I think a crispier grainy note like FA Cookie would comfortably take this into something like a drier, chips ahoy kind of cookie. You may be able to get a bit of crumble to it with some CAP Sugar Cookie, but I'd be worried about it going dry in either case.\n\nFor a cookie dough, this does manage to capture the raw vanilla extract note you get there. It doesn't really do a good job of emulating that rich, buttery texture though, and I feel like it could even more grit to it. You could go the CAP Vanilla Custard route for the richness, or maybe TPA Butter or CAP Golden Butter if either of those work for you. I think for additional grit and sweetness, maybe look towards TPA Brown Sugar, or FW Butterscotch Ripple. I'd be worried too much dark sweetness is going to drag the vanilla note into maple, but it shouldn't happen at a lower percentage.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, 1% is too light. Pretty linear, but some hints of chocolate toward the back end and a really subtle cookie dough body. Really flat, without much texture and richness. 2% is better. Fuller taste, starting to pick up a really light grain. You can taste some richness to the dough, if not really feel it. Chocolate note on the back end is still pretty subtle. Vanilla is picking up a bit. 3% has a good amount of vanilla. Cookie dough body is pretty similar to 2%, but I'm getting more chocolate on the back end of this. Chocolate seems a bit bitter, with a chemical edge on the tail end. 4% is fairly harsh overall. Seems markedly harsher than 3%. Bitter edge on the chocolate is pretty pronounced.\n\nI don't know, I like this one ok, especially in relation to the rest of the line, but FLV Cookie Dough is a thing, and I feel likes it's a fuller concentrate. Maybe a bit chocolate heavy, so maybe this will find some use.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nNot a lot of info out there.\n\n[Best I could find was a quick mention from /u/Vurve about what I'm guessing is the VG version.  In a thread about the VG concentrates not being good, he singles out Cookie Dough out of about 4 flavors as one of the ones he liked, with a note that it's harsh.  Further clarifies \"Best cookie dough I've found. As I mentioned, a tad harsh though.\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/5esh8l/i_tried_13_concentrates_from_real_flavors_and/)\n\n[Here's the product page from Real Flavors.

This hasn't changed much, still a light sweet cream. No hints of buttermilk/cheese. Pure clean cream, just slightly sweet.

Actually quite good, and strong flavor even at only a 1 week steep. Unusual for creams. Pretty authentic flavor, slightly tangy but still slightly sweet, doesn't have that flatness that you usually get from cream cheese. Sweeter than plain cream cheese, but like the natural sweetness of VG, not like a frosting sweet. I really like this, and I will be using it in a lot of recipes I'm sure. I'm thinking 3-6% in a mix. However, might lower that depending on how much it continues to strengthen with steeping. I won't be using this stand alone, not because it's a bad flavor, but because I don't care for just eating plain cream cheese. It's an accent flavor for me.\n- At a 4 week steep. First impressions were correct on this one. Became much stronger and more tangy with steep. Strong cheese flavor that will overpower if not careful. Due to how much it intensified with steeping, I am thinking .25-1% in mixes.",

Definitely not a stand alone at this percentage. Not in your face flavor. Would be great as a creamy vanilla in blends. Going to try at 15% and see what happens, maybe also with some sweetener. I like it, hoping higher percentage and steeping brings it out more. Unless it strengthens with higher percentages and steeping, I wouldn't use stand alone. Will update after further testing. Going to make an orange cream soda and see how it develops. That is what I wanted this flavor for.\n- At a 4 week steep. This flavor honestly surprised me. It had a huge change with steeping, strengthened a lot. Sweet vanilla dominant cream soda. In a tank I would raise to 15% for SF, and have actually changed my mind and would consider this for a stand alone depending on my mood.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** RF SC Deep Fried Spongecake @ 2% and 4%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 14 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Twinkies.  Lighter yellow/sponge cake with a lightly fried edge (or just slightly caramelized) and a softer vanilla cream. Really tasty, if a bit light overall. Tends to get darker as opposed to more saturated as you crank up the flavor. Another full profile from Real Flavors, but I could also see using this as a substitute for something like a yellow cake flavor.  I'd mix with this around 3%.\n\nInhale has filling up front.  Sweet, a bit on the light side but pretty accurate to twinkie filling. Some of that cakey body underneath. Not a huge fried or crispy note to it, more of that sponge cake. Exhale has a clearer cake flavor up front.  A bit more of a fried note on the inhale, but It could easily pass as just some kind of crispier edge. No kind of waxy or playdough phenolic note. Tail end of the exhale is mostly cream for me. Not a ton of body, no real dairy to it, but fluffy lightly flavored vanilla filling. A bit of wax, but appropriate for the profile. No real harshness, and sweetness is on point. I do find myself wanting more body, especially on that cake note. It's there, but it needs just a bit fuller flavor.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Pretty spooky accurate, but I feel like it's all a bit light, especially the cake note.\n \n**Throat Hit:**Nah, not really. Maybe a bit dry.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  So, again this is pretty close to a solo flavor. I think the cake needs some help. If you're feeling dangerous some FW Cancer Cake may actually be the answer.  Alternatively, you could probably get by with some CAP Yellow Cake.  FLV Pound Cake may also be a good fit if you want more of that sponge cake flavor.  I wouldn't mess with the cream that much, but you could probably throw some CAP Vanilla Whipped Cream at it if you want to bump that cream note up.\n\nUsing this as a primary flavor, I think you could take this in some interesting trashy flavor directions.  Like coconut and raspberry for something approaching a zinger.  You might also be able to bring in some chocolate and FLV cream to try to emulsify the entire thing into more of a ding-dong or snowball. This does \"hostess\" style of bakery pretty well.\n\nI also think this may have some legs as a yellow cake replacement. Not so much for a heavier cake note, but a lighter take, heavy on the frosting.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, I'm having a problem finding the sweet spot with this. 1% is too light, for sure. 2% is starting to develop a bit, some cake texture, and a really light vanilla cream. 3% seems like it's mostly moving in the right direction, but it's picking up a dark savory flavor that's getting a bit distracting. 4% is getting really dark for me, not quite burnt but almost like a straight vanilla extract flavor. 5% is even worse on that dark flavor. So I'd probably be using this around 3%, but this is delicious and I just find myself wanting more than I can get out of this.  Switching setups to a MTL seems to help a bit, as does adding some sucralose, but I'm not sure you can flavor your way into this feeling like a full vape which is kind of a bummer for a flavor this fun.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Here's a post about the darker color.

In the back I can taste just light hints of bright fruit. Moderately sweet with a hint of vanilla, this is a very decent cream flavor. I think this would mix great with anything fruity, and the background fruity notes might compliment or enhance other fruits? I am hoping it will strengthen with a longer steep.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Steep Time:** 6 Weeks\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis becomes much creamier with steeping. It has developed to become a very nice cream with a creamy mouth feel that wasn't present at the earlier steep. The fruits have developed slightly but not much. I get a very light taste of orange and pineapple, but it was so light I couldn't recognize it without looking up the description for the flavor. Just an overall generic tasting brighter fruit at this percentage. I actually like it, it's pleasant, but not quite strong enough for a SF. I am going to mix this at 20% and see if the flavor gets deeper, as it does taste good as is, just way too under flavored. However, I don't usually mix anything that high, so this is a weaker flavor overall. It's great at 15% if going for a cream, but not if you want the fruit and cream. I would start this at 4-8% as an accent flavor. At this point I'm going to say 20% single flavor?\n&nbsp;",

This tastes exactly like real french toast dipped and/or drizzled in artificial maple syrup. The egg soaked, fried bread comes through in a very, *very* pleasant way. There is plenty of buttery goodness here and the syrup is balanced really well. This is already very sweet tasting. Real Flavors page describes cinnamon, however I don't taste any (it could just be very subtle).\n\n**Off-flavors:** none!\n\n**Throat Hit:** nope!\n\n**Uses and Pairings:** I could vape this solo. Solo percent could be 1-2%. This has a lot of potential for any waffle, pancake, or crepe type profiles. The artificial syrup is perfect and the actual french toast would blend well with your other bakery notes at around 0.5-1.5%. \n\n**Notes:** /u/ConcreteRiver usually does concentration testing here, but I'm not a shiny golden flavor god like he is.

It actually tastes like a true FV Custard, rich with the egg yolk but no eggy taste, and the creamy mouth feel rivals CAP V1 for me. I am a huge custard person and CAP V1 has always been my favorite. This has overtaken it and is now number 1 for me. It has that caramelized vanilla flavor, so it won't be a sub in recipes that just need that plain vanilla creaminess. I would compare it to a super creamy, thick rich home churned FV ice cream.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIt's not that true classic \"custard\" taste. Most custards are known for that rich egg based and flavored thick vanilla cream. This is more of a an ice cream base french vanilla. I compare it to CAP to compare that creamy mouth feel. Almost like when you eat a bite of pudding or drink buttermilk. You can almost feel that cream type film on your tongue. If I tasted this blind without knowing the name Premium French Vanilla, I would say it is a french vanilla ice cream with the creamy mouth feel and density of a Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream. Or a french vanilla custard. It could be very versatile. I believe this is an excellent SF, and will make an excellent accent as well. I will update at 4 weeks to see how this strengthens/changes with a steep.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Steep Time:** 4 Weeks\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAt a 4 week steep this is still blowing my socks off. This has mellowed slightly with a steep. Until I tried it at 4 weeks, I didn't realize it had a very slight sharpness/harshness to it at the 3 day test. I thought it was part of the caramelization in the flavoring. Now it has smoothed out noticeably. I loved it at the 3 day mark as well though, it's so slight I didn't notice until I had a longer steep to compare (maybe a bit of alcohol in the flavoring?) I will go on record as saying this has moved into the number 1 slot for custards for me. I still love CAP V1 for a classic vanilla custard. But if you are looking for a rich french custard or ice cream this is the \"one\".\n\n&nbsp;\n\nEDIT: Real Flavors has announced they will be changing the names of their Raw Extracts to Super Concentrates.",

You’re not alone. This may be our finest savory offering yet! Juicy chicken with lots of extra skin…dredged in a mixture of flour, secret seasonings, salt and pepper before being deep-fried to a crispy golden hue. Yes, Virginia…there is a Fried Chicken flavor.\n\n**Flavor description**: Right off the bat I'm getting a lot of regret. Tastes convincingly enough like fried chicken. Black pepper is right up front with the taste of chicken skin. Tastes mostly of the skin with a light fried crust. I'm not getting much moist white chicken from this. It lacks the depth of the chicken flavor as you only really get a glimpse of it from this. It has a very light dark skin flavor, more than anything. It tastes like almost like drinking the grease after frying the chicken. The flavor makes you feel like you have no soul. It lingers on your receptors and makes you question your life and wonder what went wrong. I would say this isn't a KFC or Popeyes chicken but a dollar store brand mix and homemade by someone who has a very heavy hand with the black pepper. Whoever Virginia is, I sure hope she's happy about this flavor existing; because I'm not.\n\n**Off Flavors**: Black pepper? You can almost feel it pierce your sinuses. It tastes like you mix flour and half black pepper and battered the chicken. It's way too forward. They claim it has some 'Secret Seasonings' but all I can taste is pepper and a lack of self respect. The black pepper comes out more the hotter/higher wattage you have your device at.\n\n**Throat Hit**: All things considered this is pretty smooth. Not getting much of any throat hit from this. The black pepper flavor hits randomly and, while it isn't too harsh, it hits you where the florals usually do.\n\n**Uses / Why?**: What would you use this with? A better question would be why would you want to use this? Obviously some TFA Strawberry (Ripe) or INW Cactus. Or maybe some FLV Basil or Saline solution for good measure as this is missing some good seasonings. This flavor is for the brave and who wish to plague their fanatical fried chicken loving friends with questioning your friendship. 1.5% - 2% seems to be a good starting point for this being the main flavor if you hate yourself enough to want to try this.\n\n**Rating**: 10/Makes me Nauseous. No joke, I actually want to throw up vaping this.\n\n**Second Opinions**\n\n**ELR** - \t\n\n> Tastes like. Wait for it. FRIED CHICKEN ! Mixed tester at 3% and it's down say 30% in strength at three weeks in 80-20%\n\n**More ELR - VG Based Concentrate**: \n\n> \"Started vaping it at 6:30am. At first all i got is the chicken in chicken noodle soup. By 7-ish i started tasting hints of the spicy crispy breading.\" \"8am now and i'm getting more of that spice-seasoned, fried breading. Vapour production is good. At this stage it's still more 'chicken soup' than fried chicken but the spices & breading are coming up...so we'll see.\"\n\n> It's definitely KFC now. Not exactly spot-on. i'd say...more like 90% there. Being a vape, it lacks the full-on greasiness of fried chicken (though there's some there in the mouthfeel...i could be imagining that). Also the full in-your-face saltiness isn't really there (though pepper and the other spices are well-represented here). i would say this is pretty damn as close as one can get to Fried Chicken in a vape. For some this might be more akin to a Shake 'n Bake Chicken, if you know what i mean. The main difference between the two actual foods is the grease. i think it's a safe bet that some flavour components in the grease arise when deep-fried fat and chicken meet...and those are likely difficult to replicate in a vape-safe flavouring. At least fully.\n\n> The flavour felt like it had mellowed a bit in strength after 4 weeks, but not much...like not super noticeably. i could be imagining it. Then again i'm a little bit stuffed up at the moment too, so it could be that.\n",

Still not weak, just a very delicate flavor, and it's obvious with the sniff test, so I started this one a bit higher than the others. I got a very very sweet pile of powdered sugar with a hint of greasiness overlaying a slight play doh. Not really much dough or cake yet. Definitely needs a longer steep time on this one.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nLet me say that I am one of the unlucky ones that can only taste Play Doh with CAPs Donut as well, so if you don't you won't taste that in here either.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Steep Time:** 1 Week\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis has strengthened and developed a deeper flavor. It's still very light, and I am now getting a very small hint of play doh every 3rd or 4th hit instead of every one. Except extremely sweet. I am now tasting a weak amount of greasy dough that is drowned in powder sugar. For me, the sweetness is so much more pronounced than the dough, it's not balanced at all. I don't get that light fluffy fried dough from it. I can almost taste it though. Hard to tell with this one. I am going to taste this again at 4 weeks to see if the sugar settles and the dough comes out. I am also going to mix another one at 2.5% and see if a little bit stronger blend will bring the dough more forward without being too sweet. And no, this doesn't taste of cinnamon. If you are looking for cinnamon, I would recommend a churro flavoring. This dough so far will not stand up against adding cinnamon. So still undecided on this flavor, further testing required.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Steep Time:** 4 Weeks\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAt the 4 week steep, the occasional hint of play doh has completely disappeared, as well as the greasy flavor. It does taste like a very authentic funnel cake, including the powdered sugar flavor. The overwhelming sugar has calmed down, and although still very sweet, it's more balanced with the cake now. It is a very light flavor though. At least at this percentage. My concern is that the delicate flavor of the dough would disappear if mixed with any other flavors. However, the higher percentage of 2.5% may strengthen this a lot. I will update this with the stronger tests. If you are looking for just a funnel cake, this at a higher percentage would be great. Might also be good in lower percentages .5-1.5) for adding a powdered sugar flavor to bakery recipes as that is quite prominent.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nEDIT: Real Flavors has announced they will be changing the names of their Raw Extracts to Super Concentrates.",

Dual kanthal clapton coils @ 0.339 ohm. 50w power, Cotton Bacon wicks. \n\n**Testing:** Real Flavors (Super Concentrate) Grape @ 1.75% and 2.5%, 70/30 VG/PG, Steeped 6 - 13 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Grape cotton candy. This tastes like maltol/ethyl maltol combined with a grape kool-aid flavor. So much EM that it has that spun sugar thing going on, very much like using crushed grape suckers to make cotton candy on my home cotton candy machine. Or mixing 10% TFA Cotton Candy with 2% FLV Grape, maybe. \n \n**Off-flavors:** Cotton candy. It's just called \"grape\" - it were called grape cotton candy or just grape candy, you couldn't call it an off flavor. I also got a very light hint of the notorious grape medicine flavor at 2.5% at 6 days' steep, but it is gone at 13 days.  \n\n**Throat Hit:** Very slight itch at 6 days, none at 13 days. \n\n**Notes:** At 1.75%, or half the manufacturer's suggested use percent, I get more cotton candy than grape. It calls to mind a lavender colored cotton candy with just hints of grape. At 2.5%, more grape punches though and this tastes purple, like the dark spots where bites have been taken from fluffy bunch of grape cotton candy. Inhale is mild, somewhat powdery grape, with a fuller but one dimensional grape kool-aid coming in right at the top of the exhale and giving way to a spun sugar with light grapey finish that's neither offensively dry nor especially juicy. \n\n**Uses & Pairings:** Other grapes, strawberries and other berries. If grape is your main flavor, this is going to need some help. There just does not seem to be enough grape here in relation to the maltol taste to carry any kind of grape recipe. The concentrate seems to be muting itself, if that makes sense. But it seems like it might be very useful in making other grapes, as well as strawberries etc., more jammy, ripe, or sweeter, similar to adding EM or TFA Strawberry Ripe to get that effect. Might also have use in candy profiles. It's not terribly sweet as a standalone but tastes almost certain to bring out the sweetness in other flavors. Don't recommend buying this flavor, because I think anything it can do can just as easily be done with other ingredients. But if you happen to have it, as I now do, I would probably use it around 2.5% in a mix for these applications and be sure to let it steep a bit to fully rid itself of any medicine flavor or harshness.      \n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nELR notes have preferred single flavor mixes 2.5% to 3%.\n\njuice junkie lover: \"Mixed at 2.5% and let it sit a week. This is the best grape flavor I have tasted to date. It has no back taste! It reminds me of grape koolaide! I love this one!\"   \n\n*I'm guessing yucky off-notes is what is meant by back taste, and I have to agree that this is not unpleasant and does remind me of grape kool-aid. But \"best\" grape? Compared to what, I wonder.* \n\nlouiesquared: \"This flavor is a wonderful sweet grape with a bit of a bite on the end. No cough medicine here. Reminds me of Welches grape juice but a little lighter. Single flavor mix at 3% with a 3 day steep and it's very nice.\"\n\n*That bite is probably pretty common among short-steeped RF SC flavors. It is indeed lighter than grape juice to me. Light and fluffy.*\n\nTheTinMan: \"Mixed at 1.5% in a recipe. The grape really shines. Wonderful flavor with no artificial taste.\"\n\n*No artificial taste? Because kool-aid grows on trees, right?

    "markdown": "Being a new commenter, I didn't format or submit my previous post properly, so I think this is what everyone was asking for? If anyone knows anything I should do differently feel free to let me know. I promise I won't cry ;) Maybe...lol\n\n&nbsp;\n\nPlease understand these are just my opinions, and I have only been mixing for about 8 months. I hope it helps. These flavors really do need at least a 4 week steep to fully develop the flavors. VG just doesn't carry the flavor like PG. However, even using higher percentages, if they are single flavors it's not using any more flavoring than they usual 15-20% of combines flavors that is commonly used with a lot of flavoring. These are not super concentrated like INW or FA.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Lemon Cake**\n\n- Tested 10% @ 1 week steep. This is very good, I really like it. It's very flavorful at just 1 week, so might be a good S&V? I didn't try, but I also never S&V, I always give a minimum of 24 hrs for flavors to blend. Lemon pound cake glazed with sweet icing, also reminds me of the filling of lemon meringue pie just a little less tart. They did an excellent job with this one, well balanced with cake definitely there. Realistic slightly acidic lemon without being bitter or harsh. No window cleaner on this one. It's very sweet. I could and will easily ADV this stand alone. I can also see it being great to make lemon cookies, or even a great base for a lemon meringue pie if you add a touch of lime for tartness, crust, and some meringue. I see a lot of uses for this in my future. I really hope the lemon stays prominent with steeping, so hard to find lemons that do. I would start at 2-4% in mixes. I will update at 4 week steep!\n- At a 4 week steep. This is still a good lemon. It has muted just slightly with steep as is common with lemon, but very small difference. However, the cake has almost completely disappeared to me. Still very sweet. I can see this being used for a lot of mixes. This is the strongest lemon that has survived a steep I've tried yet. Haven't had INW or FE yet. I'm still getting the icing too, but the cake has faded a lot, it's still there, but barely. I am going to try this at a higher percentage and see how it does, maybe 15%? If that doesn't work, I will use it more as a S&V and not mix more than a week's worth at a time, because that first week it was amazing. I still think it will be great in other recipes for a thicker slightly creamy lemon that won't fade as much. Will be using this a lot.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Update:** This continued to fade to almost non-existent flavor. I highly recommend only mixing enough for 2 weeks or less as that is about the time frame on the flavor. But it's an amazing flavor for those first 2 weeks, so a great S&V.\n",

It reminds me of Jello brand lemon meringue pudding, like it has some type of cream. Which is very good and refreshing. I like it at 15% as a SF if you are looking for an easy instant pudding, and it has little to no harshness to the throat, which is unusual for lemon. I think with some TFA Graham Cracker Clear or Pie Crust and .25-.5% FA Cold Pressed Lime to give it that zippy tartness, this will make a very good pie.

It seems delicate, has a body to the mouth feel but not a creaminess. Getting a strange, slight chemical back note. Not getting marshmallow from it at all.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBased on these early results, I think this flavor needs a little higher percentage as it's so delicate. I would guess 2% maybe? That will be my next tester percentage, as well as retasting the 1% at 4 weeks to see if the flavor develops more with time.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nEDIT: 4 week steep. The 1% tester has remained a generic sweetness with an exhale of slight marshmallow. Has a great body to it, and the chemical note has disappeared completely. At 1% working great as a sweetener and to add a little body to a mix without actual marshmallow flavor. I do think the authentic marshmallow flavor will be more prominent in the 1.5-3% range.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis one is very similar with the longer steep in comparison to the 3 day. I did see the improvement of that chemical note disappearing, but that might have very well been improved at 1 or 2 weeks, so might consider testing it with less of a steep.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nEDIT: Real Flavors has announced they will be changing the names of their Raw Extracts to Super Concentrates.",

Pulse BF 22 with single spaced SS316L fused clapton @ .22ohm & 75W. Fresh cotton wicks on both. Steeped 19 days.\n\n**My Take:** \n\n - Well, it doesn't taste like burnt popcorn, so that's something...It actually tastes like the little bits of mocha left in the straw that you come back to 15 minutes after you've drunk the cup. However, it doesn't bring anything to the table that you can't find in INW Mocca or SC Cappuccino. Another linear RF flavor, but it's weak at every percentage I tested. Sad, because the flavor seems like it would blend well with other coffee and cream extracts. You'll just find yourself using so much of it that it just makes more sense to use one of the aforementioned concentrates. \n\n**Place in the recipe:**\n\n- Again, the flavor itself isn't bad at all. You're just gonna need to bump the percentage up quite a bit for it to show up in your recipe. I'd suggest starting at 8% and adjusting from there. It should give you some decent mid and back-end notes. I've gone as far as 20% standalone and the flavor still didn't feel pronounced. But that may be a good thing for you. Especially, if you don't like in-your-face coffee flavors.\n\n**Sample Recipe:**\n\n - Sweet Vienna Latte\n\n  - 10% RF Mocha (VG) \n  - 1.5% FLV Sweet Cream\n  - 1% SC Cappuccino\n  - .75% FA Vienna Cream\n  - .5% FA Caramel\n  - 1 drop/10mL TPA Acetyle Pyrazine (optional)\n\n**EDIT:**\n\n**30 days is the sweetspot for this stuff. I was just about to toss my test batches and decided to revisit them. The Mocha has really come to life. It still needs a support, but not as much as I originally assumed.**",

If anyone knows anything I should do differently feel free to let me know. I promise I won't cry ;) Maybe...lol\n\n&nbsp;\n\nPlease understand these are just my opinions, and I have only been mixing for about 8 months. I hope it helps. These flavors really do need at least a 4 week steep to fully develop the flavors. VG just doesn't carry the flavor like PG. However, even using higher percentages, if they are single flavors it's not using any more flavoring than they usual 15-20% of combines flavors that is commonly used with a lot of flavoring. These are not super concentrated like INW or FA.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Orange Cream**\n\n- Tested 10% @ 1 week steep. I like this one as well. It is a very good realistic slightly sweet orange, not that artificial orange flavoring found in most orange creams. Smooth and no harsh throat hit at all. However, the cream is very light with a tiny hint of vanilla and hides behind the orange. Just get a hint of it on exhale. Hopefully the cream will strengthen with a normal 4 week steep as it's a lovely flavor. If the cream doesn't come out to play, I would tend to use this more as just a plain realistic orange. But I expect the creams to develop more with time, haven't met one yet that doesn't.\n- At a 4 week steep. This is still very very light in the cream department, I probably wouldn't notice it much if I wasn't looking for it. It's still a very realistic slightly sweet orange flavor. Not in your face acidic. Good, but not sure if it's strong enough to hold up to the added creams that would be required to make it a true orange cream flavor. I don't see a use for it for me. Please remember that taste is subjective, and while this might not hit the spot for me, it's not a bad flavor either. Just not in my wheelhouse.",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** RF SC Paczki @ 2% and 4%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 13 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** A raspberry jelly donut. Modelled on a heavier Polish take, but this concentrate is quite a bit lighter. Opens with a bright, slightly floral raspberry filling with just a touch of jam to it.  Finishes with a relatively lighter, fluffy fried pastry.  Really accurate flavor, but I want just a bit more weight here and it's a little harsh.  Totally usable as a single flavor at around 3% with some sweetener, or maybe 2% if you want to thicken it up and accent it.\n\nInhale is a bit airy, with lighter, slightly floral darker berries up front. I get mostly raspberry. It's jammy, but a bit thin overall. No real pastry on the inhale, but a nice building blackberry sweetness.  Exhale has berries up front, less tart than the inhale.  Somewhere between a brighter raspberry and a darker blackberry, with the same kind of jammy but strangely thin mouthfeel to it. Light floral top notes, and feels unsaturated. It's a really good berry flavor without any kind of medicinal cough syrup edge, I just wish there was a bit more of it.  Back half of the exhale picks up some more volume and a light fried pastry flavor. No weird playdough phenolic notes, but again just a bit on the light side.  Sweetness is there, but it just doesn't seem to really stick well. Really clean finsh.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Actual flavor is accurate without any weird off notes. I think the raspberry filling is maybe a bit bright and sort of borders on floral, and overall I don't quite get the heft I want out of this for a donut.\n \n**Throat Hit:** Moderate. Has a bit of normal throat hit and it seems to be exacerbated a bit by the relative airiness.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Another really full profile, bordering on one shot territory. I think if you want a lighter jelly donut profile, you could definitely do worse than adding a bit of sweetener to this at 3% and calling it a day.\n\nIf you wanted to punch this up, I'd look at adding some jammy stickiness and maybe a touch of additional richness to the fruit filling here. Right off the bat I'm thinking of a little bit of FA Blackcurrant.  I find that FA Blackcurrant does a good job of showing up in the front of your mixes, so It should sort of work with fruit up front nature of this concentrate. In terms of bolstering the donut base, you could probably use FA Joy or FLV Donuts in a small percentage to get some body and a bit of yeast in there.\n\nBarring that, I'm not sure this flavor is going to play all that well in a supporting role. It seems to need a pretty heavy hand to actually work as a full flavor.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, this is thin and disjointed at 1%. Mostly a light, almost perfumey raspberry. 2% is better, the berry flavor has thickened up a bit. I'm getting more blackberry sweetness out of it here.  Still pretty light on the pastry, but you can pick up some of the texture in there.  The berry here is about as solid as it's going to get. A bit jammy, sweet, and pretty well balanced. Starting to pick up more of the pastry flavor, but it still seems to be taking a backseat to the filling. 4% has more intense berry, but it's starting to taste a bit artificial and harsh. No real increase on the pastry notes. 5% is pushing full harsh and artificial.  I'd recommend mixing with this at 2% if you want to accent the donut and the filling, 3% if you want something relatively balanced but lighter for a solo vape, and maybe 4% if you want to bring in a really heavy donut base.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[ELR Page for the SC Version, right here. Couple of notes, both pretty positive. One notes pastry is thin as a S&V, the other that is well balanced.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/155120)\n\n[Here's the product page from Real Flavors.

Nice natural tasting pb, not dry tasting at all. Sweet but not too sweet. Getting some kind of bright note, can't quite place it yet? Maybe vanilla, but almost fruity? Will have to figure it out. Will update again at 4 week steep. Not sure of SF percentages yet. Will wait and see how much it strengthens with steeping, but not a strong/good S&V at 10%.\n- At a 4 week steep. This flavor is much better now, gotten stronger. Good fresh baked PB Cookie, still moist tasting, but that doughy aspect isn't as strong. Might consider increasing to 12-15% in a tank. I don't taste any off or fruity note now, must have steeped out. I'm hoping it holds it's own against custards for a PB Cookie Custard :)",

In all fairness, I have found Real Flavors to get so much stronger and better with a month steep, probably because of the vg, This may end up being fantastic after a full 30 days. I will update notes when I get there.They nailed the cooked pineapple flavor aspect, but for stand alone it needs support. Has a sweet cooked pineapple with a slight background of yellow cake and hint of brown sugar. Good starting point, haven't found that cooked pineapple flavor anywhere else. I think with some help from more yellow cake, a little richness from butter, and a bit of caramel and brown sugar to provide that caramelization it will be good. It is very sweet though, so the challenge will be to add the caramel and brown sugar without more sweetness. Might add a bit of FA Fresh Cream to tone down the sweetness and help with keeping the cake moist.\n- At a 4 week steep. Ok, I didn't like this as a SF, so I started making my version using this as the main base flavor. And I can't find my tester, so I must have dumped it, so I can't give an accurate opinion after steeping. I will say it delicious in my recipe and I'm loving it :)",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** RF SC Rice Pudding @ 2% and 4%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 19 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Rice pudding with a good hit of vanilla, bakery cinnamon, and creamier base. I'm not getting too much rice out of this, but it does seem to have a neutral kind of starch taste in there. It's a bit dry, thin, and harsh overall, and the vanilla is a bit overwhelming.  Overall effect kind of tastes like a weird vanilla frosting. I think this definitely use some wetter cream to it, like FA Cream or apparently OOO creamy undertones and maybe some of that fancy FE Sweet Rice that everyone is going on about. I'd use this around 2%-3%, seems pretty harsh above that.\n\nInhale has a lot of airy vanilla up top. Not overly sweet, but it has a bit of a vanilla frosting note. Distractingly airy, with no real base to it, just a harshness underneath. Exhale is a bit more complex.  Still getting a lot of vanilla out of this, but there is a bit of bakery cinnamon in the top notes. Not really prominent cinnamon, but it's a nice accent to the vanilla. Back half of the exhale has just a flash of a rice flavor. More of a slightly grainy texture, but without a lot of the nuttiness I'd expect from a rice.  Tail end of the exhale has a kind of sticky, waxy frosting note standing in for the creams. Tastes like a weaker version of CAP Butter Cream.  Dry and thin overall. I feel like this desperately needs some fullness from some additional cream. I'm also getting a good deal of harshness here. Both the tradition stinging throat hit, and that weird heartburn-ish throat hit I'm starting to associate with Real Flavors bakeries.   Finish seems to have a bit of lingering bitterness.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Tastes a lot like vanilla frosting. I'm getting a lot of vanilla out of this, and the cream note is kind of waxy like frosting. The dryness here also kind of pushes the entire thing off profile.\n \n**Throat Hit:**  This is pretty harsh. Good ol' fashioned classic throat hit along with a weird heartburn-ish lingering harshness.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I'm still struggling a bit on the construction of these Real Flavors bakeries. I find this kind of dry and thin solo, but there is some potential here for a rice pudding. I feel like, in order to get a satisfying rice pudding, you'll need additional wetter cream and some additional definition to that rice note.  You could then add some fruit in there, apples jump out at me immediately.\n\nOutside of that, I don't feel like the cinnamon here is really prominent enough to recommend using this as a generic bakery cinnamon, and while there is a lot of vanilla here, there are better, less harsh, options for adding vanilla into bakeries.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, 1% isn't cutting it. I get some weird, harsh, sticky vanilla. 2% has that cinnamon show up a bit, and the rice note starts to come through. Still fairly harsh, and I'm not getting much in the way of cream. 3% is pushing pretty harsh and dry. Rice note is starting to read recognizably as rice, but I feel like the vanilla is too prominent and it's getting a bit waxy overall. 4% is just too harsh for me.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  Not a lot I can find.\n\n[Here's the ELR page for the SC.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** RF SC Rose @ 2% and 4%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 8 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Rose, by and large. A bit more pleasant (at least personally) than FA Rose. A bit less chalky, a bit fresher green, and a little more of a tart rosehip kind of thing.  Still like eating rose petals as opposed to rose water, but maybe fresher, sweeter rose petals?  Moderate density, middle-of-the road sweetness, and a bit of harshness. Use pretty interchangeably with FA Rose, probably between 2.5-3.5%\n\nInhale has sharp, tart rose top notes right up front. Not a ton of body underneath that, with a moderate, building sweetness. Exhale is quite a bit denser with floral rose top notes bordering on perfumey but not as bitter and thin. Lychee tartness underneath that, with some slightly juicy white grape sweetness.  Leafy, as opposed to swampy vegetal, green notes in the middle, still with that same light tartness. Towards the tail end of the exhale, especially at 4%, I get a really green banana taste on the end of this, similar to FA Banana.  Seems like an odd thing to taste, but now that I've picked it up I can't really get rid of it.  Lingering rose floral notes and tartness.  Dry on the throat, but not really on the palate.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Like eating roses, as opposed to smelling them, so that's a bit odd.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Moderate.  This doesn't really taste dry, but it seems really dry on the throat.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  As stated previously, this is fairly similar to FA Rose, but seems to be bit just a bit better. I'm personally not a fan of rose flavors, but Kopel suggested FA Rose \"pairs pretty well with Lychee, Raspberries, Pear, Hibiscus, Cherry, Grape, and Champagne flavors.\"  So I'd stick with those.\n\nEven though this has a fresher green to it than FA Rose, I'd still stay well away from creams.  It's also not really a rosewater, so I'd probably avoid bakeries as well.\n\nThis would be probably be closer to rose flavoring for shisha than at least TPA Rose Candy, and FA Rose... so you may get some mileage out of this pairing with tobaccos.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, this doesn't really seem to come together until about 2.5%. These Real Flavors Super Concentrates don't seem to work as lighter accents, as they seem to actually have a minimum percentage before they actually come together. 1% seems really disjointed, with a ligher perfumey rose note and some tart, bitter tasting body, but not really a cohesive rose flavor. 2% is getting closer to a rose flavor, but it's still a bit dry and the rose notes are really thin and sharp. 3% is less dry, more a straight ahead rose flavor. A bit green, a bit floral, moderate sweetness, and just a bit of rosehip tartness.  4% is maybe a bit too green, although it tastes almost juicier. 5% is just a nightmare, strong perfume and a really green, weird body to it. I don't really thing this is going to work as a light accent as the flavor just doesn't work right that low.  I'd say you're going to have use this as a pretty noticeable component of a mix between 2.5-3.5%, with 2.5% being a bit drier and more rose candy-like and 3.5% being a greener, tarter rose flavor.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nLol, no.\n\n[Here's the product page from Real Flavors.

If anyone knows anything I should do differently feel free to let me know. I promise I won't cry ;) Maybe...lol\n\n&nbsp;\n\nPlease understand these are just my opinions, and I have only been mixing for about 8 months. I hope it helps. These flavors really do need at least a 4 week steep to fully develop the flavors. VG just doesn't carry the flavor like PG. However, even using higher percentages, if they are single flavors it's not using any more flavoring than they usual 15-20% of combines flavors that is commonly used with a lot of flavoring. These are not super concentrated like INW or FA.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Shamrock Shake**\n\n- Tested 10% @ 1 week steep. This is the first one from RF that disappointed me. It's not a bad flavor, just not Shamrock Shake. I'm not sure if it's because my expectations were too high. Or because this flavor needs a long steep to develop. I'm hoping it's the latter, and wouldn't be surprised if it is. Seems like most mints and creams need a good steep by themselves, much less together. On the inhale, of course is sweet mint. Not overwhelming, very good level. On the exhale I get a generic cream with maybe a hint of chocolate chips? I was looking for the in your face know right away shake. If someone handed me a tank of this to try, and I didn't know what was in it, I would guess it is some type of creamy mint. If I try hard I can find hints of Shamrock Shake though, so I'm still hopeful. I will wait to rate until a longer steep.\n- At a 4 week steep. Very nice thick sweet creamy vanilla mint milkshake. Still only hints of Shamrock Shake. I like it, very refreshing. I don't taste any hints of chocolate chips anymore, and very close to the shake. But, just not all the way there. I can see myself vaping this often for the summer. The mint gives it a hint of cooling. I am going to raise this and try again at 15%, might just need more to get the full shamrock? But if not, it's still a very good vanilla mint shake.\n",

Airflow restricted.\n\n**Testing:** Real flavors Soda Base (SC) @ .5%-1%. 80/20 VG/PG Liquid Barn Premix.\n\n**Flavor Notes**\n\nThis is my introduction into the Real Flavors lineup so it is fitting that I start with something obscure like Soda Base. In truth I picked this up to investigate its' use in a slush recipe following some of the observations made by Concrete River as a possible ingredient to use in the base flavor.\n\nOn the nose I am getting a effervescent and medium bodied soda/candy aroma. Perhaps the effervescent part is \"power of suggestion\" but it does remind me of putting your nose up to a bottle of ginger ale slightly. It has the same quality that I find with FW Pink Champagne, which falls well short of carbonation but it does suggest it. The actual smell is a little non-descript on the nose somewhere between a lemon-lime soda and cotton candy maybe.\n\nI believe the suggested range for these flavors are 1-2.5% so I started at 1%. It has a medium body with a well defined sweetness on the inhale and a pleasant candy-like bordering on syrup exhale. Not syrupy like Cactus but perhaps the syrup level you get in a soda. Soda base is carbonic acid and corn syrup if I'm not mistaken so this fits pretty well. I wouldn't say it is quite that neutral perhaps more in line with some of the candy texturizes out there. Nothing too distracting and I can't pinpoint it but it does have a flavor to it that I would best described as candy-like. Not bad at all. If I had to guess I would say there is a fair amount of sweetener in here-pretty high but not overload. I'm sensing that even at 1% this is too strong to act as a component in a slush mix so I added some base to my bottle and diluted it by half bringing the concentration down to around .5%.\n\nAt .5% this is hitting the sweet spot. It is still round and present but a little more focused. It still retains a medium body to it which is impressive but again due to its nature it is hard to make sweeping declarations about its merits until it finds its way into a mix and serves its intended purpose. While pleasant by itself I don't think it would make a complete vape unless your just weird. It is really hard to describe the actual flavor but all these come to mind: syrup, dragon fruit, lemon-lime, sweet tart....the body is good but the top notes aren't super glaring which again as I think about-sets this up nice for a base. It is mild syrupy but not wet like cactus. \n\n**Off Notes** Really nothing to speak of...stays in its lane.\n\n**Throat Hit** At 1% I was getting a little harshness but I went into this with a dry scratchy throat so I'm not confident in that being a property of the concentrate. \n\n**Uses/Pairings**  I picked this up specifically as a base for furthering my slush obsessions but it seems like it could work pretty well as a plug in play with various fruit flavors to make those old fashioned soda shop types. I also think it could work in conjunction with or as a candy base when your looking for something new to get some body in a candy recipe. It suggests a mild effervescence but not too a point that it couldn't be used for other things. I would keep it around .5% or lower in a dense recipe up to 1% if you want to really push on it. \n\n**Parting Thoughts** Overall I was pretty impressed with this one. Perhaps I will post some sort of follow up as I put it through its paces in some recipes but for me anyway, it passes the single flavor test. You know your either imagining all the recipes you wan't to try it in or your eyeballing the trashcan...this one is the former. ",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** RF Soda Base, Various %'s,  60/40 VG/PG, steeped 14 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** [So, I've thought a lot about carbonation.](https://www.reddit.com/r/mixersclub/comments/5967g8/effervescence_and_you_wip/)  My basic conclusion from my testing so far is that some flavors do at least sort of emulate carbonation, but you'll always be working around their flavor profiles. \n\nWouldn't it be fantastic if there was a neutral additive that did a decent job of imparting a fizzy taste to your juice?  The answer is, of course, \"yes.\"  That would be great. I didn't find that in my preliminary testing.  Short of ordering some research grade [carbonic anhydrase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbonic_anhydrase), I didn't have any possible solutions.\n\n/u/exclusivegirl turned me on to this, as a possible solution to the neutral carbonation dilemma. RF Soda Base promises to do just that, per their marketing copy: \"There is an ancient proverb that says: “Everything is better with bubbles.” We agree! Now you can use this base to create a fun, fizzy soda flavor out of anything.\"  I wanted to test this, because as we've previously established... that would be great.\n\nTesting this solo, at 8%, I get a really light vanilla flavor. Almost a lightly astringent cream soda. Testing this side by side with an unflavored mix at the same VG%, you do notice that there is a fluffyness to the soda base along with a overall dryness. It definitely has more volume than than the unflavored. I get a little bit of bitter carbonation kind of tang on the tongue too. It's subtle. like really subtle. It doesn't really mimic the mechanical effect of carbonation, but it does sort of taste carbonated.  It almost tastes like flat club soda, where you lose the bubbles but you can still taste that vaguely mineral tang to it. \n\nTasting this, it actually reminds me a bit of FA Oba Oba, but even more lightly flavored.  Just for laughs, I have a tester of Oba Oba.  The taste of the Oba Oba, while weak, is still quite a bit stronger than the Soda Base... but the textural effect is fairly similar.  it's like a marshmallow mouthfeel effect with a ton of the actual flavor you'd expect from a marshmallow. I honestly think these may be related in some way.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  That light vanilla taste. Not objectionable in any way, but it's still there and not really included in the whole \"magic bubbles in a bottle\" description.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Definitely adds a light throat hit. I'm guessing its mostly from the dryness.\n\n**Notes:**  So in testing this, I wanted to take a single flavor and see if I could carbonate it, testing those marketing claims.  I chose FA Raspberry because (just slightly controversially) I like the stuff quite a bit and use a good deal of it.  I have a reference tester of FA Raspberry at 2%, and mixes with 3,5, and 10% of soda base. All of these have been steeped for the same two weeks.  Tasting the reference, I get florals, deep berry sweetness, and a little bit of tartness. I want to see how this stuff effects those kind of notes, in addition to how it alters texture and mouthfeel.\n\nAt 3% soda base, the fruit flavor certainly seems lighter. The florals aren't necessarily more pronounced, but I feel like the balance of the flavor is thrown off with some of the deeper sweetness muted and the tartness almost entirely reduced to a tiny bit of background noise.  It has a lighter volume to it, but the flavor is less saturated.  It's almost like that same marshmallow without the actual marshmallow flavor. I'm getting something that could kind of be read as carbonation. Not really a tingling, but a bit of dryness that's making my mouth water.  It's an interesting texture, but I don't hink it's quite like a soda. It drys the vape out too much to be a wetter, juicier flavor like I'd want from a soda.\n\nAt 5% soda base,  It's thinning out the flavor a bit more. Still not really messing with the florals but it seems like it's keeping that flavor from really coating my palate.  Like it's cleaning up the exhale of the flavor substantially. The tartness is basically gone and the deeper sweetness has been pushed up in the exhale quite a bit.  Still feels fairly dry, but that volume is taking on more of that carbon-dioxide tang. Honestly, this is pretty nice. I'm still not sure it's reminding me of a soda but it definitely is working as a texturizer to give me light, fluffy mouthfeel.  I'm going to double down on the marshmallow without the attendant vanilla and sweetness comparison.\n\nAt 10% soda base, I'm getting a hint of the vanilla here. Still not a super clear flavor, but it's definitely adding something. Florals are getting a bit bitter, clinging onto to some of carbon dioxide tang from the soda base. It's getting a bit metallic overall, especially on the exhale. The deeper sweetness is pretty much gone on the exhale, although it's sticking around on the inhale.  It's thinned out the flavor substantially, but it really has added a ton of volume while drying out the vape considerably.\n\nAfter testing all this out, I'm fairly confident in saying that this stuff doesn't really work as just carbonation. It can get a bit tingly, but I feel like that's mostly from the dryness.  It's not a bad additive though. The closest thing I really compare it to is a marshmallow without any of the flavor. It's interesting. When using this, I'd probably start low-ish at like 3% and work up. I don't really like what it's doing to the flavor underneath the soda base, especially between 5 and 10%.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nStill relatively new, and largely undocumented.\n\nThe only other mention I've seen of this from /u/Lulzorr in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/5sfjsn/need_to_add_seltzer_like_fizz_to_a_mix/), where in addition to admitting to buying RF Fried Chicken, they gave a quick take on this solo as a S&V:\n\n\"initial thoughts: I don't really know what to say about it, I can't place the exact taste. my taste buds may be garbage. There's definitely something.. soda-y to it with no steep. almost like a stale lemon lime soda.. it almost reminds me of cream soda. there is a light tingle on my tongue.\n\ndunno what else to add, it'll definitely add a soda-like quality to a mix. 5% might be too light for testing.\n\nE: a few minutes after stopping all I can taste is stale club soda. stale is a theme here.\"\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** RF SC Spearmint @ 2% and 4%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 7 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Fairly realistic spearmint, with a nice balance of light mentholation, herbal sweetness, and just a touch of actual leafy green to it. Spearmint itself has an almost creamy kind of sweetness to it. A bit sweeter than real spearmint, but it feels fairly natural and isn't cloying. A tiny bit of throat hit here, but it seems to settle in and smooth out after a couple of drags. Mentholation is pretty light for a mint flavor, something like mint gum as opposed to the full on altoid icy-ness you can get off peppermint and some other spearmint flavors. I'd use this as a realistic spearmint accent in darker fruit mixes, or as a beverage mint in cocktails or teas.  Suggested mixing percentage would be 2.0-4.0%, with this getting leafier and more mentholated as you increase that percentage.\n\nInhale has a sharper, mint leaf flavor in the top notes. Mentholation varies based on percentage, at 2% it's light and up at 4% I still wouldn't call it super icy. Building sweetness, just barely touching on a candy level sweetness as the inhale goes on. Exhale starts off almost creamy, with a smooth spearmint flavor with some higher herbaceous green notes. Not quite \"leafy\" but a lot closer than other spearmints I've tried. Creamy smoothness fades out a bit on the tail end of the exhale, and it's picking up more of that herbal spearmint flavor. Sweet overall, but doesn't quite cross into candy sweetness. Mentholation is still on the subtle side, pretty similar to the inhale. Some lingering sharper mint notes.  Also seems to make your lips just a bit raw, and that sticks around for a while.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Nah.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Light. Seems to settle in pretty quickly though.  I am noticing a bit of chest tightness with really deep inhales, but that could just be the mentholation.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This is by far the least mentholated spearmint I have tasted, and it's not quite herbaceous enough to be super realistic, it gets very close.  This may be *the* mint for background use in fruit mixes. This should add just a bit of green freshness to apples, pears, plums, raspberries, and other slightly darker sweet fruits.  I could also see this working well with citruses, melons, and cucumber.\n\nI think the major sleeper application of this flavor will end up being beverages. This simulates muddled mint in cocktails better than the other spearmints I've tried.  I also think the lack of heavy mentholation and bit of green here is going to make it work really in teas.\n\nI also think this could be used to add a touch of mint to tobaccos without dragging them into full blown menthol.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, this isn't particularly aggressive. I'm not getting much at 1%, maybe a bit of green sweetness and some extremely light mentholation. 2% feels a bit flat, but it should work as a ligher background accent. Mellow spearmint sweetness with just a touch more mentholation. 3% has a noticeable but not overwhelming mentholation, and the greener herbal quality of the mint is getting more pronounced. I'm notbout getting too much more sweetness than at 2%.  At 4%, you can feel the mentholation, and the greener notes are getting a bit leafy. Honestly, this does a pretty good job of selling actual spearmint at this level, but it does drag along some (realistic) menthol baggage. 5% is starting to get a bit bitter for me, that mentholation is kind of setting off whatever is making this taste a bit leafy and it's not entirely pleasant. 6% is starting to come apart a bit, and the flavor seems disjointed and a touch chemical. I'd recommend mixing with this as a light accent at about 2%, and moving up to about 3.5% if you want the spearmint to be recognizable as spearmint.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nI can't really find anything.\n\n[Here's the product page from Real Flavors.  Their take: \"Spearmint is milder and sweeter-tasting than peppermint or menthol, yet still minty. This flavor will make a welcome addition to teas and cocktail beverages. Feeling bold?

Pretty solid heat to this, At 2%, I'd say it's maybe just a bit less spicy than actual sriracha, but you've got the added bonus of having it all through your lungs and sinuses.  Garlic heavy, but handled in about the best way it could be. There's a honey sweetness and a savory almost oyster sauce kind of body that gives the garlic some body.  More roasted garlic than straight raw garlic.  No overwhelming acidic vinegar type of taste, but still enough acid brightness to really set the entire thing off.

    "markdown": "My first flavor review! Almost 8 months and I finally found some time to give back to the community that has done SO much for me. I don't consider myself a flavor guru, but I do feel like I have a firm grasp on how well certain concentrates mesh with one-another. This is the first of 5 or 6 reviews from the RF lineup that I'm currently testing. I'm a straight shooter which is why I barely leave reviews or release recipes since my description game isn't very strong. All of my notes on flavors and recipes will be straight to the point.\n\nGremlin sent a 5mL bottle of it with my last order. Even though it was free, I don't want it to go to waste! \n\n**Testing @ 5, 10, 12, 14% 70/30:**\n\n**Setup:** \n\n- OG Goon 24 with single SS316L Tri-fused clapton @ .18 ohms & 95W. Pulse BF 22 with single spaced SS316L fused clapton @ .22ohm & 75W. Fresh cotton wicks on both. Steeped 23 days.\n\n**My take:** \n\n- Real Flavors has a few awesome flavors, but this is not one of them. It's extremely middle of the road, but not a useless or bad flavor by any means. I get equal parts of strawberry and kiwi but the blend is not particularly strong. It's sweet and candied, but not obvious enough to be a top note in any recipe. However, it has a relatively thick mouthfeel and isn't dry or harsh at all. At this percentage, I could see it being used as a base to layer brighter fruits and a bit of cactus to create a pretty satisfying and mouth-watering candy flavor. With the density I'm getting, it could probably even be used just to sweeten a fruit 'n cream mix since the flavor isn't too pronounced and can be easily hidden by more potent concentrates. \n\n**Sample recipe:**\n\nI'm bad at naming things...Steep time: 2 days.\n\n- 10% RF Strawberry Kiwi (VG)\n- 2% JF Sweet Strawberry\n- 3.5% FW Kiwi\n- .25% INW Cactus\n- .1% TFA Dragonfruit\n\nIt's a simple little mix that's easy on the throat after the Kiwi has calmed down. The Sweet Strawberry and Kiwi boost the Strawberry Kiwi while the Cactus and Dragonfruit respectively moisten and bind the dominant flavors. Vapor is sweet, wet and dense.\n\n**EDIT:**\n\n**This is a VG-based concentrate. Retested at 10, 12, and 14%. My thoughts from above remain the same. This is a weak flavor that NEEDS help to be recognized in a mix.** ",

Just buy it.\n\n\n**Off-flavors**: nothing at this %\n\n\n**Throat Hit**: nothing at all\n\n\n**Uses & Pairings**: some pairings ripped some from the Flavor Bible: almonds, apricots, bananas, berries, biscuit, blackberries, blueberries, boysenberry, brandy, buttermilk, caramel, cardamom, champagne, chocolate, cinnamon, cloves, coriander, cream cheese, fresh cream, custard, elderflower syrup, ginger, grapefruit, grapes, guava, hazelnuts, honey, lemon, lime, mangoes, maple, nutmeg, melon, passionfruit, papaya, orange, peaches, mint, pies, pecans, pineapples, pistachios, plums, pomegranates, raspberries, rhubarb, rum, sugar, vanilla, walnuts, yogurt\n\n**Notes**: \n\nI like this right around 1.5-2.5%, not a noteworthy change for me from 1-14 days\n\nI’ve had trouble mixing this with heavier creams they kind of flatten it out, I’d avoid that but maybe you can use Shisha strawberry or JF sweet strawberry to help this out against some heavier stuff like I see in [these](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/47718#not_your_nonna_s_strawberry_custard_by_shakenvape007) [recipes](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/44489#basil_fawlty_s_basil_infused_strawberry_ice_cream_by_sejouced). \n\nI haven’t tried in many bakery applications but I don’t doubt it would be great there too.\n\nI’ve paired this with strawberry ripe very successfully but not with FA strawberry, it’s just too dry. It really doesn’t need much help but ripe strawberry keeps it juicy without taking anything away.  (2% of each is wonderful)\n\nWorks well with fruit mixes. Here's [one](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/47720#strawkiwi_malone_by_smoky) or [two](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/46896#lawless_by_sixstrings952)\n\n\nI’ve really enjoyed this solo, I even mixed up a 30ml of this solo at 2% and vaped through it all. \n\n**Strawberry non-tasters report being able to taste this one.**\n\n[This is a very good and pretty simple mix focused around this ingredient by a strawberry non-taster](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/38333#vibe_s_milk_by_mediocrevibes)\n\n\n**Second Opinions**:\n\nPlenty of notes on [ELR](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/111143?exclsingle=0&filter=0&sort=score&direction=desc#recipes) mainly praise as a realistic and delicious flavor.\nGreat reviews on ECX even one by me, [Vince](http://www.ecigexpress.com/shop/diy-e-liquid/browse-flavorings/fruit-flavors/strawberry-sc-by-real-flavors.html)\n\nRF site link and blurb: [Arguably the most beautiful of all berries, strawberry is a standout classic with countless uses (you know what they are). Natural, rich, ripe and sweet…our Strawberry flavor presents the juicy, familiar taste you’d expect from hand-picked strawberries on the farm.

Single SS Clapton 26g/36g, 6 wrap/3mm id (30-40 watts)\n\n\n**Testing**: RF Sugar Cookie 2%, aged 1 day and 11 days\n\n\n**Flavor Description**: \nThis is more like sugar cookie batter than a finished sugar cookie. Got a real birthday cakey taste. Not very buttery though. Very sweet, you can almost taste sugar granules on the exhale. It’s lacking any crunch to it but the whole thing is really well done. This is a very good place to start for a sugar cookie base or to add a little something to your cakes/cookies. If I had to say this reminds me of something it would be a no name sugar cookie you’d find at a supermarket with a decent bakery section. No huge change in flavor with a steep, I had no problem S&V this.\n\n\n**Off-flavors**: Tastes like cookie batter/dough so I guess that’s a little off.\n\n\n**Throat Hit**: Nada\n\n\n**Uses & Pairings**: \nThe sky’s the limit here imo (I guess bakery is the limit in actuality). Add some FA cookie or JF biscuit for that crunch and you’re half way to a Royal Dansk butter cookie. This is going to be a great sub for cake batter/cake batter dip that contain DA/AP for those who are averse. I really can’t see where this wouldn’t fit considering it’s a sugar cookie and you kind of know what you’re signing up for. \n\n\n**Notes**: \nI need to test this at lower % especially in some mixes to see what it can add. I feel like this is kind of what I wanted from CAP/JF yellow cake, I know that sounds weird but this kind of has that yellow taste you get from cake batter / sugar cookie batter. I can really see this working in a lot of recipes and I am sure many have picked it up when it was free a couple weeks back. \n\nObvious comparison is CAP sugar cookie, this RF is truer to what I expect from a sugar cookie. Where CAP is buttery and has amazing mouthfeel, this one is brighter and sweeter with a little less body. This won’t be as versatile as CAP’s just because for me Capella Sugar Cookie v1 is just not a straight sugar cookie. Capella’s is like some delicious buttery bakery beast that can be molded into other things like waffles, cakes, cookies, pies, cereals, custards and even ice creams. The RF sugar cookie is plain and simple a sugar cookie and will be slightly more limited in use. \n\n\n**Second Opinions**:\nCouple notes on ELR about the VG based one, one states: [Real Flavors recommend 8-10% going by my past experience I mixed this at 12% as I find I need a little higher personally.Shake and Vape , Deep Water Ti build .006 ohms at 55.0 watts.Nice strong , very sweet sugar cookies as in the homemade kind with lots of sugar on top.Nice doughy feel , best sugar cookie flavor I have found.Good enough standalone but can see lots of possibilities with this one.I would drop it in the 8% range though for a mix .](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/80848)\n\nNotes on ELR about the SC version: [Very nice Sugar Cookie flavoring authentic taste. Not enough depth for stand alone. Use as a base in bakery profile Eliquids. \nWorks well at 2.5%, Shines at 3% of mix](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/129244)\n\nNot a lot else out there. Here’s a link the to Real Flavors Page and their little blurb:\n[Soft, moist holiday cookies with a sugary coating…there’s nothing better to enjoy with a hot beverage. Now you can get your fill of these classic baked treats without the calories.]( http://www.realflavors.com/shop/sugar-cookie-super-concentrate/)\n\n**They ain’t wrong** I would recommend this to anyone.\n\n\n[Link to all flavor reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)\n\n\nedit: this is tested at 30% PG and 1.5mg nic",

If anyone knows anything I should do differently feel free to let me know. I promise I won't cry ;) Maybe...lol\n\n&nbsp;\n\nPlease understand these are just my opinions, and I have only been mixing for about 8 months. I hope it helps. These flavors really do need at least a 4 week steep to fully develop the flavors. VG just doesn't carry the flavor like PG. However, even using higher percentages, if they are single flavors it's not using any more flavoring than they usual 15-20% of combines flavors that is commonly used with a lot of flavoring. These are not super concentrated like INW or FA.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Sweetened Condensed Milk**\n\n- Used 10% @ 1 week steep. Very authentic flavor especially in such a hard to find flavor. Sweetened milk with a nice rich thick mouth feel, with almost a hint of dulce de leche mixed in. Can't wait to try this again at 4 weeks, assuming it will get noticeably richer. Not a stand alone flavor for me, but oh what it will add to my mixes! I'm guessing 2-6% in blends.\n- At a 4 week steep. This is very very authentic and delicious. I'm not getting any hints of dulce de leche now that it has steeped. Pure thick sweet rich cream, great mouth feel. This will be getting a lot of use. Among many others, I can see replacing sweet cream with this. It's thicker and creamier. Can't wait to play. Cakes, custards, ice cream, 7 layer bars...mmmmmmmmm.\n\n**UPDATE:** UPDATE: This still continues to impress me, in the 1.5-6% range for mixes.",

    "markdown": "**Setup:** Recoil w/ flavor barrel, Dual 15 wrap 26g 3mm Nifethal 70 coils @.15 ohms.  60w power, 450F temp limit. Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** RF SC Taffy Base @ 1% and 2.5%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 6 days, others noted\n\n**Flavor Description:** Solo, this doesn't have much in the way of the flavor but it has a really thick, and almost chewy mouthfeel to it, which is a pretty promising start to a taffy base. It has some pretty restrained vaguely fruit candy sweetness with a bit of tartness, almost like a light sweet tart but with no chalk or grittiness in there.\n\nMixed, this definitely carries that body but it doesn't seem to homogenize super well with the flavor it's being added to. You've got a big hit of lightly flavored thickness on the back end of the exhale. I'm also getting a metallic twinge when mixing this with other concentrates. I'd recommend using this at .5-1% for some taffy-like texture on really heavily flavored fruit mixes, and small percentages for smoothing out harsh or overbearing mixes.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Solo, not at all. It's weird to have that thick of a vape without much flavor behind it, but nothing tastes odd.  Mixed, this adds a bit of a weird, hot, metallic taste to whatever the other concentrates.  It's not overwhelming at lower percentages, but at 2% and above it tastes like the air does when you've been welding.  Like hot metal and maybe just a hint of like a flat sulphur-y or ozone note to it.  It's a bizarre flavor to try to describe, but it's pretty distinctive.  I could just be tasting my coils all of a sudden, but in that case, something in the concentrate is making me taste them.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Nah, solo or mixed.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**\n\n**1% RF SC Taffy Base, 2% DIYFS Holy Vanilla:**  Definitely the winner out of the bunch.  The thicker texture and light candy sweetness is doing a pretty good job of making this kind of taste like taffy. Top notes on the vanilla seem a bit sharper, and the flavor in the base seems to be a bit muted and less rich. Light hot metal taste to this, even at 1%. I'm also finding that the taffy base kind of takes over the back of the exhale, and the vanilla is a lot thinner after that initital hit.  It could homogenize a bit on a steep, but in my experience flavors don't really shift around their position in a recipe just based on a steep.\n\n**2% RF SC Taffy Base, 3% FW Root Beer**  I don't really notice the hot metal here, but I'm definitely getting a clear separation between root beer, and then the taffy volume. Spice notes are pretty bright and sharp, but the middle feels a bit thin. This concentrate seems to push spices and florals up, and mute out the middle a bit. Not as pronounced as RF SC Candy Base, but similar.\n\n**3% RF SC Taffy Base, 4% OSDIY Blue Raspberry Slush** Slush here is definitely a bit muted, and that hot metal taste is pretty prominent. Definitely thick, but the higher percentage of Taffy base has the back end of this tasting weird, with that density but without any of the Slush flavor actually making its way to end of the exhale. 3% is definitely too much of the taffy base.\n\nSo based on these tests, I'd recommend keeping this low, and coming into it with recipes that are almost deliberately a bit overflavored.  Seems like heavy, bright, or syrupy fruits would be your best bet.  Additionally, just for laughs I added some of this to FA Mandarin (which I get a good deal of harshness from) at .25% and this is doing a bang up job of thickening that citrus flavor a bit and calming down the sharp edges, so I'd also look for this to work as a citrus smoother at like 1 drop per 30ml.\n\n**Notes:**  I'm thinking this is another sub 1% additive. I still get plenty of texture out of it, but it does comparatively less damage to the underlying flavor. I'd start at .5% and work up.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nPretty sparse overall.\n\n[ELR doesn't have anything useful on the their flavor pages, but I found a forum post where user Fozzy71 \"...taste tested the SC Taffy Base today at 2.5% and am quite impressed. I probably haven't ate taffy in 30 years but it tastes like what I expected it should. This should be quite tasty mixed with some fruit.\"](http://forum.e-liquid-recipes.com/t/real-flavors-super-concentrates-tasting-notes-part-1/92474/856)\n\n[Here's the product page from Real Flavors.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** RF SC Tomato @ 2% and 4%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 21 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Fruit or not, this tastes all kinds of odd. All the kinds of tomato crammed into one tomato concentrate. Starts off with a darker, almost cooked tomato paste flavor, thins out to a raw, fresh tomato flavor, and finishes with some really funky overripe almost fishy tomato flavor.  I think that darker cooked tomato flavor and the strange aftertaste really limits the utility here if you were looking for a raw, fresh tomato or even tomato juice flavor.  If you do want to mess with this, I probably wouldn't go much above 2%, or those off notes become really aggressive.\n\nInhale isn't too bad. Sharp, slightly acidic bright tomato. Not really ketchupy or too dark, but it lacking some of the brighter raw tomato I'd want to make this about as palatable as a tomato concentrate is going to get. Maybe a bit sweet though. The sweetness kind of brings in that reduced tomato paste kind of flavor. Exhale is.... complex. There's a bunch of darker tomato flavor up front.  Along with that sweetness, it's straight tomato paste. It thins out a bit, and you get more of that green, raw, bright tomato.  That part's pretty okay. The tail end of the exhale gets even weirder. I start to get some fishy, overripe notes out of this. In my video first take I talk about how fish food smells... and I still don't think that that's far off. It's almost like an anchovy paste flavor. Like the tail end of Worcestershire sauce or homemade Caesar dressing. It's less than fun, and it sticks around for a while. \n\n**Off-flavors:**  Assuming you want just a raw tomato, the cooked stuff up front and whatever is going on in the backend definitely detract from that.\n \n**Throat Hit:**  Light to moderate. It's not too bad, a bit acidic and harsh, especially on the inhale.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  [This.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/recipe/1157081/Zinger%20Burger%20With%20Fries)  You should totally make this recipe and then get to back to me. I want video.\n\nNo, seriously though, finding a use for a good tomato would be fairly hard. I'd think maybe pretty neutral fruit pairings like apple or pear might work, and anything to bring in some juicyness would be a good idea.\n\nUnfortunately, I'm not really feeling this because of that tomato paste and weird anchovy note on the back end. I think with how savory this flavor ends up being, I can't think of much I want to do with it.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, this is light at 1%. Probably a good thing, but you don't get too much tomato. Mostly just a cooked, dark, sweet tomato-esque accent. If you want to use this in a savory mix, that wouldn't a bad place to start. 2% I'm getting some more of that raw tomato in there, which is nice. That back end is definitely present and pretty gnarly though. It gets worse at 3%. More tomato, more cooked flavor up front, and more of that off flavor. At 4% it's just too heavy on the off-flavors. \n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nLol, no.\n\n[Here's the product page from Real Flavors.  Their take: \"Ah, tomatoes.

Not surprised, as it's custard and only been 1 week. No eggy taste to this, more cream than custard. Good, but not memorable. I like it as a vanilla cream type accent flavor, but need more from a custard. Will try again at 4 weeks, it needs steeping for sure. Might need to go 12-15% on this one for SF. I will update and rate after further steeping.\n- At a 4 week steep. The flavor has really improved on this. I would still not call it a custard, but it's a very creamy instant vanilla pudding. No egginess and still not rich. Nice sweet vanilla. Not super strong, good strength in the RDA, I think it would be too mild at 10% in a tank. I would aim for 12-15% SF for tanks. Not sure in a mix, probably start at 4% and go from there. I would not vape this as a custard, more as a mixer, this isn't even in the category of Capellas.

Tastes like a background note here. This does lack all of the body that the TFA version does bring. That is definitely from the lack of Diacetyl and Acetoin in this flavor. This flavor honestly tastes like a fat free vanilla ice cream. It will kill your craving but it doesn't make you hate yourself after eating it. The flavor suffers from the same sort of \"flatness\" that concreteriver has talked about in his reviews. It doesn't feel like this a full flavor. The flavor feels incomplete compared to what is on the market.\n\n**Off Flavors**: Nothing of note; no black pepper\n\n**Throat Hit**: Nothing; Really smooth\n\n**Uses**: It would be a shorter list to index all the profiles this wouldn't fit. Everyone here is well aware of what this flavor goes well with. Considering the lack of body I would use this flavor for a sweet vanilla note boosting a ice cream profile. Or just a vanilla flavor in general. I honestly wouldn't recommend this over the other flagship vanilla flavors like DIYFS Holy Vanilla or INW Shisha Vanilla. This would fit a niche sweet vanilla use.\n\n**Rating**: This isn't a TFA VBIC replacement IMO. This doesn't check nearly enough boxes to even pass off a suitable substitute.

Now you can satisfy your juicy melon cravings any time…without the seeds. Crisp, mouthwatering flavor will soak your senses!\n\n**Flavor description**: Wow, first impression is this stuff is incredibly sweet. This is possibly the sweetest flavor I've ever vaped. Not in a bad way. This stuff tastes exactly like eating some watermelon sour patch kids. The sweetness isn't artificially chemical tasting. Almost get the feeling of it lingering on your lips. This is definitely a candy watermelon flavor but the best damn one I've tried yet. Nothing like a real tasting watermelon as they described. No rind notes or anything outside of just a straight watermelon candy. No chemical or artificial off putting notes either. It has almost a gummy flavor to it without actually being able to taste anything gummy related. It has a lingering moist and juicy taste to it not like that dryness you get from LA and TFA Watermelon. Similar to the effect you get from INW Cactus. I'm getting some sour at the end of the exhale. It's not that noticeable but it's there. For how simple a flavor like this they hit every single note to make a very \"authentic\" artificial tasting candy watermelon flavor. Colored me surprised on how delicious this flavor is.\n\nThis seems to be more of a PDO dominate flavor. I'm making the assumption that they are putting PDO in there. They do sell concentrates based in PDO. I'm picking up no alcohol flavors or harshness. The viscosity appears to be inline with a semi diluted PG type flavor. I could be wrong here so take it with a grain of salt.\n\n**Throat hit**: Nothing of note/ incredibly smooth\n\n**Off-flavors**: Nothing outside of a candy watermelon\n\n**Uses**: .5%-1% seems to be a good starting point for more of a background note or going against some lighter fruits.  1.5%-2% for the top note. Going this high with it might make the sweetness over bearing/sickly sweet. I can see this being very useful for adding sweetness in lower percentages in candy recipes that seem to lack that 'brightness' you want. This will pull anything you make into more of a candy profile. This could, in a lot of recipes, be exchanged for LA Watermelon at, obviously, a lower percentage as this does it better IMO. Mixing this with a light non-dairy cream such as TFA Whipped cream would be good if you want to try to take it into a sherbet flavor because of the shear amount of sweetness this has.\n\n**Rating**: 9/10\n\nI'm rating this high because it is what I hoped LA/TFA Watermelon was. This flavor is exactly what I have been wanting from a candy watermelon profile. It's concentrated and right in your face. Will have many uses around a fruit/candy type profile without having to go up to 9% to achieve it.\n\n**Second Opinions**: \n\n> [ELR](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/114919) - Mixed at 2.5% and let it sit a week. This is pretty authentic watermelon flavor. It reminds me of summer months eating fresh watermelon. It's sweet and juicy! I think that 2.5% is probably a little high and would be better at 1.5-2%. Overall it is still a really good watermelon flavor. \n> \n> Preferred single flavor mix: 2.0%\n\n \n",

This is my first experience with yumberry, and I'm not sure what the real thing tastes like. The flavor is similar to boysenberry to me, which has been until now my favorite. That type of bright refreshing sweet berry without any perfume or tart flavor. Seems to be a good percentage of flavor. I am going to mix another tester at 1.5% to see if I can push it a little stronger without adding perfume, just to see how well it will stand up in heavier bakery flavors.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTime will tell if this stays the same strength or deepens a little with a steep. Already planning Yumberries & Cream, Yumberry Danish, Yumberry Cobbler, Yumberry Ice Cream, Waffles with Yumberries, PB & Yumberry Jam Sandwich.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nEDIT: At a 4 week steep. This flavor has surprisingly faded a little bit with the longer steep. Still bright and juicy, just not as strong. I will be using this as a S&V at around 1-1.5% as it's plenty strong as a SF. If using in something I will be steeping I would start at 1.5-2.5% SF. Starting point as a mixer for me will be at 1% and go up from there. Very refreshing, I'm liking it a lot. If you like boysenberry you will like this one.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nEDIT: Real Flavors has announced they will be changing the names of their Raw Extracts to Super Concentrates.",

Its more like a \"blue\" cough syrup. It tastes almost mentholated, to be specific.

With Thai Pineapple being so good, I had high hopes for another fruit offering from SSA. This is a big let down, though.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Solubarome Apricot Tart @ 3, 6, and 10% 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 9 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  All apricot, no tart.  It's named apricot tart, so you'd expect some kind of crust note in here but it just seems like an apricot flavor.  Under about 6% you get a lighter tasting, sticky or jammy apricot.  It's a bit less earthy than FA Apricot, so it seems fairly promising on that front but this gets weird as you try to fill out the flavor. Up around 10%, it tastes like FA Apricot mixed with too much INW Cactus. Same kind of floral, green, juicy bordering on sticky thing going you get with cactus overflavoring.  While it's not terrible, it's a bit offputting for something claiming to be an apricot bakery. I can see using this to sort of push stone fruits like peaches, cherries, and plums into a fillling direction at a relatively low percentage (4-5%) but those cactus-ish off notes at higher percentages sort of limit the application of this as a primary component in a mix.\n\nInhale has some lighter apricot flavor but it feels pretty thin overall. As you start cranking the percentages up it gets some higher aloe or green banana notes. Not particularly sweet, but it has an interesting jammy texture that leaves a pretty tangible stickyness in your mouth. Exhale is pretty similar to the inhale. Light apricot flavor up front. Less earthy and spicy than FA Apricot, leans more toward green and floral. Cactus and banana notes in there, getting more prominent through the exhale as that apricot thins out. Same jammy mouthfeel and stickiness overall. Not really sugar lips sweet, but it's more like a gelatin kind of stickiness.  Some juiciness in there, especially in the mid range of percentage between 6-8%. Below that it's pretty thin, and above it starts to get sticky to the point where it dries the vape out.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  First off, no real crust or bakery note in here for a tart. Also gets distracting green and sticky as you start increase percentage to try to fill out that apricot note.\n \n**Throat Hit:**  Nah, not really. Pretty smooth in general.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I think the most useful application of this is going to be backup for plum or peaches flavors to add some cooked filling kind of consistency to those stronger flavors.  That green note that comes out is really pretty distracting if that isn't what you're looking for, so I'd keep it at 5% and under.\n\nThat weird cactus-y apricot thing at higher percentages isn't bad, but I'm sort of at a loss for what to do with it that doesn't just end up in \"weird fruit mix\" territory. I love me some weird fruit mixes, but it'll be hard to drag it towards a specific profile.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, I don't get much out of this at 3%. Really light mouthfeel with a really light apricot taste and some sticky mouthfeel. 6% isn't that much stronger, still definitely sticky and a bit airy, but does a pretty good job of at least tasting there is an apricot involved somewhere in there. Bumping up the percentages, 8% is starting to get a bit green and floral. Really similar to cactus with less mouthfeel involved. 10% is even cactusier.  Personally, I'm a fan of cactus and I don't hate the flavor but it's odd. 12% is maybe too heavy on that green floral note.  I'd keep this in an accent role under 6%.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nI can't find much solid information on this beyond the product page. 15 reviews on there though. I'm pretty heavily reliant on google translate here, so bear with me... but they seem mostly positive. So I could dead wrong on this flavor.\n\nUser \"Medhl\" says: \"I love this aroma and I do not get tired of it: apricot cooked a touch of sweet biscuit, a delight!\"\n\nUser \"Fethy B\" says: \"Good but attention to overdose, under pain of having a raw meat flavor.\"  (That's a fantastic review, even if was mangled by auto-translate.)\n\nUser \"Eric B\" says: \"A real success alone or accompanied by this aroma is a treat for the taste buds.\"\n\n[Here's the product page.](https://www.solubarome.fr/boutique/aromes-gourmands/477-abricot-tarte-arome-e-liquide.html)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Solubarome Brazilian Blood Orange @ 3%, 7% 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 7 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Chewing on tangerine peels. Tart, slightly bitter and extremely zest forward. Sweeter and brighter than something like a navel orange.  The opposite direction from a more subtle, earthier blood orange. Very little orange flesh and nothing approaching an orange juice. Really harsh freshly mixed, and seems to have faded out noticeably over a week. I'd use this at a relatively low percentage as a orange zest note, closer to 2-3% with the idea that it's going to take a week to calm down and blend into a mix.\n\nInhale is all zest. It's a bit thinner and sweeter than navel orange zest.  Definitely closer to a mandarin or tangerine, but still realistic to zest. Top heavy flavor, without a thicker, sweeter base to it.  Exhale is again mostly zest, almost entirely top notes. Light, realistic bitter citrus zest notes on top of all that tangerine zest.  Just a tiny bit of a sweeter citrus base but it's too airy and dry to really read as the fruit of the orange.  Lingering sharp tangerine zest.  Actually feels like you've ate a chunk of tangerine peel with the rawness and citrus oil taste.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Doesn't taste anything like a blood orange. I still don't have a ton of experience with raw blood oranges, but I expect a sweeter, darker, earthy orange flavor and instead i'm getting bright, lightly sweet tangerine.  Also almost no fruit body to this.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Freshly mixed, very harsh.  Calms down a bit with a steep, but I'm not getting any deeper juicier flavor taking the place of that harsh zest. It just vanishes a bit.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This is mostly just zest, so I'd probably only use this where I'm looking for a bright orange zest note. That pretty much limits it to more realistic fruit mixes or maybe beverage applications for something like an orange twist. I don't think using this will get to a blood orange, but you maybe able to fill out with a sweeter, fuller orange like FA Royal Orange, FA Blood Orange, or FA Mandarin.\n\n**Notes:**  This is offically my first Solubarome concentrate, so I'm a bit unsure on concentration. Chef's is recommending something nuts like 13-15% and that pretty clearly seems like overkill.  The ELR page doesn't have any real information on it, but it does suggest 4% mixed and 5% solo, and that seems closer to the truth.  Starting at .25%, it seems really thin. It's a noticeable tangerine zest, but it's just a thin hint. 1% still doesn't seem to really come together. Largely similar to .25%. Maybe a bit more intense, but still a bit thin. Starts to cohere and gain a little bit of body at 2%, but judging by the testers this will fade out a bit. Steeped at 3%, this tastes a lot like fresh mixed at 2%. 4% doesn't really seem to add much to the equation, same with 5%. 6% is unpleasantly harsh, at least fresh.  7% fresh is crazy harsh, and steeped it isn't that much better. I'm still not getting much body underneath. Pretty much just overwhelming tangerine zest. Just because chef's said to try it, I went up to 13% and nope. Doesn't really have any more dimension or sweetness than about 5%.  Just more zest, and stil harsh.  I think you get enough zest from this at 3%, and I don't much benefit going above that.\n\nOn the bright side, this stuff was crazy cheap from chef's.  Based on the current exchange rate, It's like $2.55 for 30ml.  Chef's has some wonky (in a good way) pricing, but even looking directly at the Solubarome site, they are asking $4.40 for 30ml directly from the manufacturer, so the whole $2.55 from a rebottler isn't that weird.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nNot much.\n\n[Here's the product page from Solubarome.  They don't really have a flavor description on there as far as I can tell. There is one review on there from \"franck h\", google translated from the french it reads: \"It is very good, but in additive.\"](https://www.solubarome.fr/boutique/aromes-agrumes/1152-orange-bresil-arome-e-liquide.html?search_query=orange&results=17#/contenance-30_ml)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**\n\nH/T to /u/ID10-T/ for the suggestion.",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Solubarome Guava @ 3%, 7% 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 8 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  A whole lot like CAP Sweet Guava, but a bit thinner and harsher. On the upside, it doesn't have that flat sweetness of the CAP \"Sweet\" line, but it doesn't seem to offer much benefit beyond that.  A candy guava flavor, maybe usable in something like a guava nectar with some additional body.  Like CAP Sweet Guava, doesn't taste a whole lot like actual guava.  Seems to be on the weaker side, I'd use between 5-6% as a primary note and maybe around 3% as a backup.\n\nInhale is sharp and fairly floral. Some deeper candy guava sweetness but it feels a bit dry and lacking a deeper juicier guava nectar flavor. Not as bright and acidic as FA Guava, but also not as harsh although it's got a bit of a dry throat hit to it. Exhale has guava candy with a touch of artificial banana up front, with floral top notes. More plastic-y than perfumey, but still a bit sharp and bitter. Candy sweet base comes out a bit more on the exhale. Still no real juice to it, almost like a hard candy texture. Sweetness level overall is okay, but the construction seems a bit odd. Sweetness is all up top, without a deeper sugary base. Lingering bitter florals and a bit of a raw acidic mouthfeel. Fairly harsh, mostly a dry harshness.\n\n[Oh, and super fun, apparently this may have some oil in it.](https://www.planetofthevapes.co.uk/forums/ecig-discussion/product-recalls-and-general-safety-notices/threads/french-concentrates-by-solubarome-may-contain-oil.39099/)  Or at least it did in 2014. I'm not seeing any separation so maybe it was reformulated?\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Not really for candy guava. Gets floral and plasticy at higher percentages.  Also a bit thin overall.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Harsh right after mixing, settles down a bit, but it's still pretty solidly harsh.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I feel like CAP Sweet Guava can get a bit muddy when mixed at higher percentages with other fruits if you're looking for something bright and refreshing. Since the flavor profile here is so similar, I'd basically use this where I want CAP Sweet Guava but I want to let some other fruits shine though a bit more. So basically fruit mixes with other bright fruit components. \n\nThe harshness here is similar to a citrus harshness so this might benefit from mixing with either some straight EM or a flavor with maltol like TPA Strawberry to calm down the throat hit a bit.\n\n**Notes:**  So now chef's is telling me to use this between .5-1% after saying the Brazillian Blood Orange needed 13-15%.  Que? \n\nConcentration testing, this doesn't really seem to come together until about 3%. .25% is pretty non-existent. 1% is light and floral, 2% is still distractingly thin, and while 3% is better, it still needs just a touch more to come together as a solid flavor. At 4%, it's still on the thinner side in absolute terms, but you get most of the body available. Sweet, but it's a top heavy sweetness without a juicier base. Clear candy guava flavor though. 5% is a little juicier, but the harshness seems to be kicking up a bit. 6% has a clear bright candy guava flavor but it's starting to push heavily floral and harsh. 7% is getting too floral overall, with that bitter edge from the florals getting a bit chemical.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n/u/inrespekkt/ warned me about the relative paucity of information available on these, and they definitely seem to be right. We are squarely in the land of poorly indexed forums.\n\n[User \"Yasumi\" on some vaguely sketchy looking forum has a bunch of quick takes on Solubarome concentrates. Their take on Guava: \"ah yes, tastes like guava nectar or perfectly ripe fruit, I like it.\"](http://allaboute-cigarettes.proboards.com/thread/35873/solubarome-concentrates-france?page=7)\n\n[User \"Bosken85\" on ATF has a recipe up called \"Yummya Guava\" that has a quick note in the recipe description for SA Guava: \"It's a real nice tropical styled guava.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Solubarome Italian Bergamot @ .5%, 2% 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 9 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Earl Grey tea, minus the tea. Functionally very similar to FA Bergamot, although the SA seems to be a bit more herbal with an almost lavender note.  The FA seems to have a bit more of a green citrus to it.  Other people have noted that in the FA version, but I've never really noticed it. Tasting them side by side it's a lot clearer and I'm starting to get what they are talking about.  I'd maybe take advantage of the more herbal note here and use it in earl grey teas, probably at .25-.5%.\n\nInhale is on the floral side. Higher lavender and violet type florals without much in the way of citrus peel. Some deeper, almost chalky candy sweeteness but it's pretty mellow compared to that floral note. Exhale is a bit more complex. Spicy bitter lemon / orange dried peel notes, bordering on an almost black pepper kind of heat. Clearer lavender floral kind of flavor towards the tail end of the exhale. Same kind of powdery dry sweetness.  Seems a bit oversweet touching on cloying solo. No real green, leafy sharper citrus flavor like FA Bergamot. On the thin side overall, but feels appropriate for a bergamot. Moderate harshness, primarily from the dryness and spicier notes.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Not really? I feel like there is some kind of lavender-esque herbal quality to this.  Still seems accurate to the bergamot you find in earl grey tea.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Moderate. Not crazy for how aggressive this flavor is. Maybe a bit less harsh than FA Bergamot at comparable percentages.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I'm really only aware of two uses of Bergamot in mixes, earl grey tea and citrus backup for cereals. I think Solubarome Bergamot may be a better option than Flavourart for the earl grey applications. It tastes a little flatter and definitely more herbal. Seems a bit smoother too, and should work well with black tea and there are less sharp citrus edges to clash with lighter creams.\n\nFor cereal applications, I still feel like the flavourart bergamot is the better choice. I still don't get a ton of green citrus peel out of it, but it's definitely more prominent in the Flavourart than the Solubarome.\n\n**Notes:**  Chef's is back up to a 13-15% recommendation with this one. Nope, just nope.\n\nI'd say this is just a hair less potent than FA Bergamot. .25% is definitely present but thin, useful as an accent. .5% is a pretty solid bergamot flavor, herbal just bordering on peppery. 1% takes that herbal note and goes full black pepper. 2% is unpleasantly sharp and spicy, with a chemical bitter taste. I'd recommend mixing between .25-5% depending on how aggressive you want the bergamot note in your mix.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[So there is a review on Chef's from user \"Antonella C\". It's in italian, and the google translate seems pretty wacky but here goes: \"Good. Dilution Council at 10%.\nLower the glycerin in the base as it tends to degrease the dilution liquid after 3 days. Great in mix with menthol.\"  As far as I can tell, that would be recommending a dilution. The original review uses the word \"rapprendere\" which has been translated as degrease I think? Translating this seperately I'm getting \"coagulate.\" So this may be another hint that this is oil based because it's separating out of the VG at 3 days. I haven't noticed any separation, but I habitually shake everything before vaping it.](https://www.chefsflavours.co.uk/solubarome/4307-italian-bergamot.html)\n\n[Here's the product page from Solubarome.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** SA Lime Rum @ 2%, 4% and 6%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 11 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Like hugging your uncle after he's been playing volleyball and pounding daiquiris.  There's definitely some candy-ish lime here, with an actually accurate white rum to it but there's this distinct musk. Almost like a dude's deodorant or cheap cologne.  This initially seemed really promising for a rum that actually has a boozy note, but that musk is fairly distracting and scales up really quickly based on higher concentrations. I'd use this as backup in trying to emulate blended alcoholic drinks that can take a lime note. 2% seems to get you a bit of an alcohol hit without going full into that musk.\n\nInhale is mostly \"green\" lime-ish taste. Kind of a candy lime, little bit of tartness, but no real zest or realistic fleshy or juiciness. There is a bit of bitter, boozy funk in here, kind of a weak rum note but it seems to be fairly realistic.  Inhale is on the sweet side, just a bit syrupy.  Exhale has that same sweeter candy-ish lime up front.  Still tastes pretty \"green.\" No real zest in the top notes. Boozy, musky flavor comes in hard on the back end of the exhale. Booziness is a little hard to really put a finger on, but it seems to have a bit of warmth and alcohol bit. That musk is fairly prominent and dominates the back of the exhale.  Almost sandalwood-ish with that kind of generic men's deodorant aroma. Exhale is maybe just a bit airy. Some harshness on the tail end of the exhale. Still a bit sweet for a straight rum, but it seems to fit okay with that flatter \"green\" lime note. Lingering musk and a tiny bit of sugar lips-ish sweetness.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  That musk is weird.  I don't think it's 100% out of place, but it seems way too prominent based on the relative strength of the rest of the concentrate. It does seem to settle in a bit, especially at 2%.\n \n**Throat Hit:**Moderate? Mostly shows up in the back of throat on the tail end of the exhale.  \n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  It's not a generic white rum flavor with a lime twist. It tastes a lot like a truly bad margarita or a slightly less bad blended daiquiri. I'd keep this in a accent role to add at least a bit of realistic rum to a lime cocktail flavor, leaning more towards sugary garbage cocktails.  I think you could probably get away with a little bit of lime in something like a Pina Coloda as well.\n\nThat musky note makes it hard to think of a use for a primary flavor.\n\n**Notes:**  Chef's is recommended mixing between 5-10%, that seems pretty high. Concentration testing, this doesn't quite seem linear. At 1% I'm not getting too much flavor, just a hint of lime. Not super realistic, not too juicy, not too zesty. Just kind of tastes lightly green. At 2% the lime is a little more clear. Kind of light candy lime with just a bit of sharp boozyness.  That musk is there but it doesn't really overpower at this level. 4% has more of that musk.  More boozy and accurate to white rum mixed with some kind of lime, but that musk is pretty prominent and fairly distracting. 6% is pushing full cologne on top of white rum.  Seems accurately boozy, but like it's been sweated out of someone.  It's... interesting. If you want to avoid that musk, your best bet is sticking around 2%.  I personally don't find the musk here unvapeable, but it's probably not what you want out of a lime rum flavor so I wouldn't really use this higher as a primary note.\n\nThis is not fantastic, but it seems like a step in the right direction in looking for a rum flavor. I'm not wild on how strong that musk is, but the underlying flavor shows some promise in looking for an actual white rum flavor (C'mon, FA Jamaican Rum is super tasty but it doesn't taste boozy.)  It's promising enough it's got me excited about picking up some more alcohol concentrates from Solubarome and seeing how they stack up.  It's not going to be quick or anything, but I'll definitely be back looking at their booze flavors.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nNah.\n\n[I found a mention on a french forum by user \"jean-baptiste\" via google translate: \"Pleasant, like the green fluid, to use when the temperatures go up,Pleasant, like the green fluid, to use when the temperatures go up.\"](http://www.forum-ecigarette.com/viewtopic.php?t=157331&start=13110)\n\n[No information on the ELR Page. But there are hints of a truly interesting recipe in there... There is average percentage used of 6%. This is only used once with three other flavors TPA VBIC, TPA Cheesecake Graham Crust, and TPA Greek Yogurt. I'm going to assume thats all from the same recipe because the minimum and maximum mixing percentage are the same. So somebody mixed this at 6% with VBIC, Cheesecake (graham crust), and Greek Yogurt. That sounds uniquely terrifying.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/117549)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Solubarome Madeleine @ 3 and 6%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 16 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  I'll be the first to admit that I don't have a good grasp of real madeleines, but wikipedia (which is never wrong) says it similar to a lighter sponge cake, using whole eggs and often with some almond paste in there. And that seems like a pretty good description, although i'd maybe argue a bit about the whole eggs here. No sooner had the warm vapor touched my palate than a shudder ran through me and I stopped, intent upon the extraordinary thing that was happening to me.  It's definitely a cake flavor. A little bit lighter than the cake from a yellow cake flavor, and no frosting note to speak of. It could totally be the power of suggestion, but I think I can pick up a bit of a softer almond flavor somewhere in there. It's pretty similar to a light bakery vanilla, but just a bit nuttier. I'm missing some of the richness I'd expect from whole eggs, might skew a bit closer to an angel food cake but there seems to be an errant butter note in there. I'd use as a dry, sweet cake component in the places where you want a sponge cake, starting at about 5% and working up.\n\nInhale is mostly just sweet and a little dry. Some grain here, but a pretty good sugary as opposed to sucralose sweetness. Exhale is a bit more complex. Again, dry sweet cake. No yellow or frosting here. Sponge cake dryness, with some of that lightly carmelized cake batter taste that could pass as slighty nutty or almondish if you squint really hard. Could also be a light vanilla. Texture is fluffy, with a bit of grain to it. Nothing really heavy, hard, or super rich here, but there is just a light butteryness to it. Sweetness is really straight ahead white cake and manages to pull off the effect of a heavily sweetened angel food cake pretty well.  Some drier harshness in there as well. Finish is really clean, sweetness fades out really quickly.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  It's the damndest thing, but I get some anise out of this down low. Seems to scale back at about 5%.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light? Nothing too major. Pretty straight ahead harshness on the exhale, but it's definitely light side. Might just be the dryness here.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This might be a better option for a lighter cake flavor than just underflavoring a yellow cake. The sponge cake thing would definitely work, and I don't think it's far off from angel food with just a bit of a butter note added.  If you want a distinct cake sweetness and texture, without richer eggy notes, you could definitely do worse, especially if you flavor heavy enough to get past that anise.\n\nI'd stay away from heavy frostings, and instead go with more whipped creams like FW Sweet Cream or CAP Vanilla Whipped Cream. With fruit pairings, I'd stay with some lighter, tarter takes on berries. Brighter strawberries and blueberries jump out.\n\nGood cake for lighter citrus notes like adding some zest to the batter.\n\n**Notes:**  Chef's is recommending 5-10%, and that isn't terrible advice. Needs a heavy hand to get going. Starting at 3%, i get a pretty distinct anise off-note and some dryness without much texture. 4% is still too weak and anise-y. 5% moves away from the anise note. Fluffy texture starting to come in. I don't get much anise at all at 6%, just fluffy cake texture. 7% is solid, maybe a bit nuttier than 6%, which is nice. 8% is getting a bit too dry. Good texture but the dry thing is outstripping the texture. 9% is starting to taste a bit chemical and dry. I'd probably start with this at 5% and work up.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nIt's all mangled google translate from here on out.\n\n[Largely positive reviews on what looks like a french distributor.

Solo, this doesn't really capture that. I get mostly a soft, underflavored fluffy texture with a really light cook. I'd say this is closer to just a straight ahead sugar cookie. Definitely a bakery, but pretty bland pushing that weird cardboard note you get a concentrate with texture but no strong flavor. Sugar cookie sweet, but light overall. More like smelling sugar cookies.  Almost reminds me of the rice note from a lighter horchata flavor, bordering on a rice cake. It's fairly unobtrusive and would probably fit in lot of profiles, but it doesn't really bring much to the table and feels pretty inessential to me. If you are using this, I'd start at around 7% and work up.\n\nInhale is mostly just bakery sweetness. Very blond bakery note. Might be a tiny bit of vanilla and maybe cinnamon in there, but it's a slightly airy, sweet but insubstantial inhale. Exhale is pretty similar. Fluffy, but no real texture or grain. Prominent, but really fleeting insubstantial sweetness. Some more interesting spice and vanilla in the top notes, but that's pretty subtle. Tail end of the exhale is like sweet cardboard. Any flavor here fades out hard. Some light harshness, and a distractingly clean finish. \n\n**Off-flavors:**  Some kind of cardboard or maybe rice cake vibe to this. Texture without much taste.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light, the solubarome bakeries I've tried get a bit harsh on the exhale.  This one is on the smoother side of that admittedly limited sample size, but the throat hit is there.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:** Solo, I feel like this is lacking the crunch, body, and spice note to really pull off a speculos cookie. I think you could probably get there by adding INW/JF Biscuit, either CAP Gingerbread or FLV Ginger Snap, and maybe a little bit of extra spice. It runs dangerously close to the point where this concentrate is a bit superflous if you have to accent it that much.\n\nAs it stands, more of a bland sugar cookie flavor than anything else... and that sugar cookie niche is pretty well serviced by CAP, FW, and RF.  Maybe look in this direction if those aren't working for you for whatever reason.\n\nI could also see taking advantage of the non-descript bakery note here and going in the direction of rice krispies treats.\n\nIt's definitely a niche application, but seems like a good fit for fluffing up a tobacco recipe with dark, heavy pipe tobacco flavors.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, this is going to require a fairly high percentage to get whatever it is this flavor has to offer. 3% is just straight texture without much flavor. Basically just sweet cardboard. 6% is a bit better, still cardobard on the back end, but that generic bakery sweetness has at least a little definition. 9% is a bit too dry to be pleasant. Largely the same as the 6%, but that dryness is getting gnarly. 12% is just very sweet cardboard.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[281 reviews with a 3.9/5 average on this site, so obviously somebody likes this stuff.](https://www.lepetitvapoteur.com/en/solubarome-aroma-brand/840-solubarome-speculos-aroma.html)\n\n[Here's the product page from Solubarome.

Crispy, dry, and sweet with that kind of toasted meringue and vanilla note you get from waffle cones specifically. No butter or syrup notes, which is a good thing.  Some earthyness in the griddled note, but it's not terrible I guess. A little dry for a solo waffle.   This seems dry enough to point where I'd be a little hesitant to throw more at this to dry to make a full waffle unless you went full batter or dough.  Without the help, it should work for a ice cream cone or maybe a dry, thin crunchy wafer note. Seems to come into it's own around 3%.  Too dry to really do a primary note.\n\nInhale is dry and sweet with an almost meringue like taste. Vanilla top notes and a dry waffle ice cream cone kind of grain to it. I can't really get past the initial flavor on the inhale, as it's dry to the point where it's difficult to actually take a deep inhale.  Exhale has that toasted meringue flavor waffle-ocity. No real dough of batter to it, more a dry crispy note.  Some bakery vanilla in the top notes. There's an earthy note there on the back half of the exhale that's maybe supposed to be bringing in a toasted flavor or griddled note that largely works but it tastes just a bit dirty.  Fairly sweet, but it's a really dry sweetness.  Some dry harshness here. Finishes fairly clean except for that dry thing.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Light earthiness to the griddled note. Also I think that dryness counts as an off-note.\n \n**Throat Hit:**  Really dry solo, to the point of being a bit difficult to vape.  Also some traditional dryness.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This already tastes like a waffle cone, why fight it? Seems like a pretty good pairing with ice creams for a cone note. I think really buttery or heavy creams are going to kind of seep into this, so you may want to stick something a little closer to soft-serve. \n\nI also think this will do a pretty bang-up job emulating wafer cookies. It already has the dry crispy vanilla thing going on.\n\n**Notes:**  Hard to really find a sweet spot here. At 1% this feels a bit thin and disjointed, with that earthy note seeming pretty prominent. 2% is a little more put together. Flavor is cohering a bit more, but it's still just a bit overbearingly earthy without that sweeter waffle really balancing it out. 3% is getting pretty dry, but it feels like a full flavor. Definitely a waffle cone here. 4% is even dryer. Waffle cone flavor is a bit clearer but that dryness is a drag. 5% is a sweet, dry desert. I'd recommend using this at 3%.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nUh, not really that I can find.\n\n[Here's the product page from Solubarome.

If you have additional notes PLEASE share them.\n\n**Setup:** Narda Clone, Single coil  26g Kanthal @.7 ohms.  25W Power, Half wicked with Native Wicks Platinum Blend\n\n**Testing:** SC Blackberry @ 5%. 70/30 VG/PG, steeped 0 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  I got this flavor because of /u/thadentman's crackberry pie recipe on atf. I have TFA's version but I am a junkie and have to collect them all. I am glad I did! This is very different from tfa's as in it is very sweet, juicy and more a candied blackberry.

I ordered a few things I thought would work including TFA Caramel cappuccino. ( AKA skunks asshole )I found out very quickly, that coffee concentrates are difficult to work with, and most of them are complete garbage, and not worth the effort, or investment. \n\n The problem I was running into( as I'm sure anybody who has tried to make a coffee flavoring can affirm) all of these flavoring we're very bitter, and had a skunky awful aftertaste. So I put that one on the back burner, hoping that one day I would come across a concentrate, that is worthy of the effort. Well my friends that day has come!!! Super concentrates cappuccino, is no doubt, hands down, the best coffee flavoring I have ever worked with.\n\nBig shoutout and thank you to rage is a lot of work for recommending this flavor. \n\n**SOLO**  2-3%  **MIXED**  2-3%\n **Throat hit** 5/10\n\n**Flavour Profile**\n\n\nCappuccinos, defined in worldwide Barista competition as a coffee and milk beverage, that should produce a harmonious balance of rich, sweet milk and espresso. \n\nAnybody who frequents the coffee shop knows not a big difference between a latte, and a cappuccino, and for the purposes of a flavoring concentrate even less.\n\n\nI'm going to break this flavoring down, into two separate components the coffee,  and the cream.\n\n*Coffee*- obviously the strongest component of this flavoring. The coffee comes off dark rich slightly nutty with some light toasty caramel notes. Unlike other coffees I have experimented with it is not incredibly bitter and skunky. \n\n*Cream*- I think this is where super concentrates, really knock this one out of the park. This flavoring has a fantastic sweet cream flavor, to balance out the coffee providing a great single flavor cappuccino. There is definitely a hint of vanilla on the back end of the cream. \n\n**Recommended Pairings**\n\n\nWhat doesn't go good with coffee? I think the list is pretty short. I would avoid highly acidic Citrus flavors. But that's just me, and I'm sitting here thinking about it, a nice sweet lemon mite pair very well with this flavoring. The list of pairings is pretty obvious, but going to do my due diligence, and knock out a few for you.\n\n Creams and ice cream flavorings are at the top of my list. \n\nNutty flavorings like FA nut mix, or flavor West hazelnut, should really help highlight the light nutty note in the concentrate. \n\nFor the life of me can't think of a bakery, that this would not pair well. one of my favorites cap sugar cookie, and flavor West yellow cake are among the first things I will try. Flv macaroon or Gingersnap also sound like winners to me. \n\nOne of the first things that stood out to me is how well this is going to pair with the few tobacco's in my Arsenal.\n\n Candies such as butterscotch, and caramel, should really bring out the toasty caramel note already present in this flavoring. \n\nThe whole list of vanilla should also work wonders in this already fantastic concentrate.\n\n Spices such as cardamom, and cinnamon, are obvious choices as well. \n\nNot so sure about Florals but we all know honeysuckle goes with everything lol.\n\n**Overall**\n\nI really put this concentrate through its paces starting at .5% and moving all the way up to 3%.  at lower percentages the concentrate tends to fade quickly. \n\nBetween 1 and 2% not much difference. The concentrate gets stronger and does not fade quickly. Still no off notes, and Unlike other coffees, does not overpower other flavorings when used in a recipe.\n\nAt 3% you start to get a hint of that skunky aftertaste and I hesitate to push it any higher.\n\nGoing to get this one 4 out of 5 it's not perfect, but I'm very happy with this concentrate. Below 3% you're not going to get that strong, bitter, skunky flavor. Which is going to make it, sooooooo much easier to work with!!! No need for advanced, flavor bending, or hiding off Note tricks. Would definitely recommend this flavoring or mixers of all levels. As far as I know baycityvapor is the only place  purchase super concentrate but I could be wrong.",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** SC Caramel Candy, 3%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 8 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Nope.  This tastes nothing like caramel candy.  Burnt Popcorn / Over-roasted coffee beans up front with a sour overripe banana finish.  Something went terribly wrong with this flavor.  Compounding my bafflement, this is probably the least sweet of all the SC flavors I've tried so far. There is some kind of mouthfeel sort of like a softer caramel and a bit of butteryness in here, but the concentrate just doesn't seem to have any sort of grasp on what caramel, candy, or even food in general tastes like.  There is no percentage at which this works, although the mouthfeel does get better as you crank up the concentration with the benefit of a sour vomit taste.  Still seems to be fading out rapidly, but I'm okay with that in this case. I don't have a suggested use for this.  Either I got a bad batch of this, or a flavorist was huffing glue when they put this together.\n\nInhale is thin and sour, with a warm banana tinged sweetness that slowly builds. Burnt top notes a lot like the bad part of coffee concentrates. Exhale is burnt popcorn up front with a bracing, bitterness.  Sour, acidic top notes and some rotten fruitiness in the top notes.  The concentrate taunts you with some richer buttery mouthfeel after that burnt popcorn note fades a bit, but then a bunch of random banana and that buttery taste gets weird and rancid with that acidity.  Lingering pangs of regret and existential cris as you wonder what on earth brought you to this point.\n\nComparing this at 3 and 8 days, there is substantial fall off in flavor. The sourness is maybe less pronounced but it's just giving way to vaguely rancid edge on the back end and that banana off flavor seems to get stronger. Burnt popcorn seems largely unchanged.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  There is not a single flavor in here that I would associate with a caramel candy.  It has just a bit of a mouthfeel in there that could conceivably pass as vaguely soft caramelish, but the flavors here have almost no relation to caramel candy, and none of them are pleasant.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light, I guess? It's not overtly harsh.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This does exactly one thing right, and it's some of the mouthfeel in the middle of the exhale. Everything around it is downright unsettling, though.  I personally don't think there would be a use where this isn't going to be off-putting.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, at 1% this extremely thin and sour with heavy burnt note to it. 3% is a little thicker, but I'm getting a lot of overripe banana in that thicker mouthfeel.  The sourness does not play well with what little caramel I'm getting out of this.  5% is starting to get a rancid dairy note to the back end, and that sourness is getting watery. At 8% it's pretty fundamentally wrong.  It tastes like watery sour milk and dark roast coffee.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  The whole \"your mileage may vary\" thing is implied with flavor reviews, but I'm honestly lost at how people are using this.\n\n[This should be the same thing as VZ SC Caramel Candy.  It has 4 reviews with an average of 4.5 stars.  I give up. \"Ole Harald Skagen\" claims: \"Nice caramel, but has tiny bit of \"burnt\" smell.\"  Either I'm crazy or we have wildly differing opinions of what exactly a \"tiny bit\" constitutes.

No sense of authentic fruit here. It reminds me of a blow pop without the gum center or a grape jolly rancher, although, not quite as sour as a jolly rancher. Very forward on the tongue.   \n\n**Off Flavors:** There were no discernible off flavors as far as I'm concerned at this percentage. The whole taste experience was just grape-y goodness.  \n\n**Throat HIt:** 2/10. This flavor is very smooth for a candy/fruit flavor  \n\n**Uses** I am really bad at this part a I don't have much creativity. This would be good in, well, a candy or bubblegum. It would also be good in some sort of grape cocktail as it is reminiscent of a cheap grape juice.  \n\n**Pairings:** Any bright, candy like fruits would be right at home with this flavor. I wouldn't use this in creams or bakeries unless you maybe used a touch of liquid amber with it to create a grape jam but in my opinion it is too much of a bright, candy-like grape to work where there are better grapes to use in bakeries.\n\n**Notes:** I tried this throughout the steeping process and although the flavor doesn't change much it does fade a tad so I would recommend using this flavor in shake and vapes or adding a touch more than you think you would need.  \n\n**Second Opinion:** Would love to give a second opinion but there doesn't seem to be much out there in the way of other notes so you'll just have to take my word for it that this shit is good lol.  \n\n[Other Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)",

    "markdown": "**Setup:** Recoil w/ flavor barrel, Dual 15 wrap 26g 3mm Nifethal 70 coils @.17 ohms.  60w power, 450F temp limit. Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** SC Mandarin, .5 and 2%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 10 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Tang.  Mandarin orange, with a heavy powdery sweetness. Relatively bright, but fairly harsh without the usual zest culprit. A little bit of earthiness and waxiness to this, but not as earthy as something like FW Blood Orange and not as waxy as FLV Orange Citrus. Overall effect is a lot like CAP Sweet Tangerine, but with a truer sugar as opposed to sucralose sweetness.  Doesn't seem to fade as drastically as some other SC flavors.  Another flavor I wouldn't really overthink. Sweet citrus in a fruit mix, or a base for a candy orange flavor. I'd stick with the standard 2-2.5% with this.\n\nInhale is prettily heavily sweet, with a sharper tangerine flavor. No real zest, but a lot of the same kind of harshness. Sweetness level is maybe a step short of straight candy, but it has a bit of a chalky texture to it. Exhale has bright tangerine up front.  A little airy and thin, with a slight earthy note note. No real zest top notes. I pick up a bit of warmth and waxiness. Dry sweetness dominates on the back half of the exhale, dragging this into more of a tang than realistic mandarin or tangerine flavor.  Lingering sugar lips, but otherwise a fairly clean finish.\n\n**Off-flavors:** A little bit of earthy waxiness tempering that super sweet tangerine. Not distinctly earthy enough to taste dirty or anything, and the waxiness isn't too bad for a citrus.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Moderate. Not completely out of a line for a citrus, but it has some rough edges.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I'd use this pretty interchangeably with CAP Sweet Tangerine. It doesn't really have a zest note, so it probably won't work all that well as a light accent. I'd use it a bright component in a fruit or citrus mix with other flavors that aren't cloyingly sweet or harsh.  It would also be a good base of a candy orange flavor.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, this starts out a bit harsh and fills out. At 1% and under, I get mostly a harsh, bright and bright tangerine, but it's still on the thin side. This doesn't really seem to get more harsh as you increase the percentage, but the concentrate fills out with sweeter tangerine around it.  1.5% is starting to fill out, with that sweet tangerine coming in to balance some of that harshness. 2% has a solid tangerine base, and while it's sweet it's not overwhelming. 2.5% has a touch of more recognizable earthiness coming in. 3% tastes a little too green from the earthiness, and that sweetness is pretty dry. 4% is chalky and bitter.\n\nA little unexpected for a citrus, but this seems to be fading out a bit less than some of the SC Fruits I've tested. It's definitely lost some brightness over 10  days, but most of that base tangerine flavor is still hanging around. It's still faded out a bit, but it's not as dramatic as I was expecting.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Here's the ELR Page. A couple of quick notes. User \"kathybl\" says: \"@2.5- okay, reminds me of CAP tangerine- something like a kool-aid packaged flavoring.\"](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/7466)\n\n[Postive reviews on VapingZone.  User \"Joanne G\" 5-stars it with : \"Fresh like an orange without the purfumy taste.

The first pull after shaking was very chocolate forward. Almost like melted dark chocolate, with a hint of tobacco to follow. It feels like the balance is off here somewhat, a more robust tobacco note would be really welcome here to pair with the dark chocolate.\n\n\n**After a week:**      \nThat chocolate forward flavor is still very present, the tobacco has started to become slightly bolder but it still feels like it needs help. The richness and heaviness of the chocolate notes haven’t changed much if at all.\n\n**Off notes:**      \nI don’t see it as an off note, but nothing led me to believe that there would be chocolate here until I smelled it. I can’t imagine it’s unintentional though, and they did a good job of leaning into a dark chocolate without somehow ending up in the realm of waxy artificial chocolate. .\n\n**Throat hit:**   \nMilder than expected, minimal “bite”\n\n**Suggested pairings:**      \nRich vanilla custards, dark fruit, whiskey/bourbon, more robust tobacco, caramels. I don’t think you can totally get away from the tobacco undercurrent, but it feels as though it will lend itself well to embracing the flavor for what it is and transforming it to your needs.\n\n\n[DIY_Ejuice’s Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** SC Pineapple, .5 and 2%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 8 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Candy pineapple, pretty spot on to haribo white gummy bears. Very sweet and relatively simple. Some actual tartness in there but pretty overwhelmed by that sweet candy base. Moderately dense vape with a good deal of heavy mouthfeel to it, pretty spot on for a candy flavor.  I wouldn't overthink this one, You may want to blend with a bit of tarter TPA Pineapple or INW Pineapple if you want to nudge this slightly in the direction of realism or just accent around it for a candy pineapple profile.  2% seems like a good starting point assuming you're going to steep for a week. Tartness seems to fade pretty quickly though, so maybe 1% for a Shake and Vape.\n\nInhale has a bit of tartness up front. Not like full on fresh pineapple tart, but at least a bit of zip to it. Building candy pineapple sweetness underneath. Tastes like actual sugar, no artificial sweetener or heavy sucralose notes. Moderately dense, with a light harshness. Exhale is basically just candy pineapple. White gummy bears, par excellence. Some really subtle tartness that breaks up the candy sweetness, but that same really heavy sugary candy sweetness. Seems to be a bit on the warm side, assuming the temp control on my mod hasn't gone wonky.  Tarter notes keep this from tasting completely flat, but it's a more linear, non-realistic, heavily sweet candy flavor. Again, fairly dense for a fruit and a bit of harshness from all that sweetness. Lingering sugar lips.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Nah, really heavy on the candy side, but nothing weird or off.  Seems to vape quite a bit warmer than I'd expect? Not 100% sure what would be causing that, but I've had to bump down the temperature on the mod a couple times.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light. All that hot sweetness can get just a bit harsh.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Candy pineapple is the obvious one. I wouldn't think this needs any additional sweetness, just your texture of choice. Should work relatively well with the FW candy texturizers or FLV Candy Roll.\n\nThere may be some use for this for a heavily sweet pineapple juice note when mixed with brighter, lighter flavors.\n\nIf you wanted to go a bit more realistic, or least more tart, you could use this for a base with a TPA Pineapple or INW Pineapple accent.\n\nCould theoretically work for a sweet syrupy pineapple in a bakery.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nConcentration testing, this seems really linear. At .25%, it's mostly just sweet with a tarter pineapple hit. Still tastes a little thin and unsaturated. Freshly mixed, .5% is actually pretty solid. Tart but still fairly sweet pineapple. Not a lot of nuance, but a pretty full flavor. After a week though, that tartness is lacking and it's a dull, flat sweet pineapple. At 1% it's just more. Bright pineapple tartness and a sweet candy base. 1.5% is getting sweeter, tartness level seems unchanged. At 2% fresh, this is pretty intense pineapple. Actually feeling a bit too acidic. A week out though, this seems to be sweet spot between the sweetness while still retaining some of that tartness. 3% fresh is almost cloying sweet, and that pineapple feels a bit harsh and acidic. 4% fresh is officially too sweet and acidic for me.\n\nThat bright pineapple tartness seems to fade out pretty quick. I did some testing with this between days 3 and 6, and that brightness seems to fade pretty dramatically. I think this flavor runs the risk of fading out entirely to that white gummy bear flavor as it steeps out past a week.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nPretty thin documentation and isn't super helpful.\n\n[I picked this up from BCF as \"Super Concentrates\" brand, but it's also available through Vaping Zone. Two reviews on their site. User \"Lawrence Hall\" is succinct: \"5% is nice - needs some tart.\"  \"The Good Witch\" gives it 5 stars and adds: \"I make this for a couple of people. I make it with 2.5%, 40 pg and 60 vg. They love it and can't get enough of it.\"](https://www.vapingzone.com/Pineapple-Concentrated-Flavor/pid-530.html)\n\n[One tiny note on ELR.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** SC Raspberry, .5 and 2%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 7 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Candy raspberry with a heavy, bitter, floral edge.  At low percentages, tastes more like an aggressively artificial lychee flavor. Raspberry hard candy comes in with a heavier hand, but it's a very artificial. No real fleshiness, juiciness, or nuance. A flat, warm, sweet raspberry.  Sweetness level is very high. It manages to taste like a sugar sweetness instead of sucralose, but it's all very sweet and cloying. I'm coming up a bit dry on uses for this when other raspberries out there are better and can easily be made into candy flavors, but if you are using it, I'd go for about 2-2.5%.  It's intensely sweet at that level, but it seems to be required to get a distinct raspberry out of this.\n\nInhale is sharp and a bit chemical with all of those bitter artificial florals just smacking you right in the face. Heavy floral lychee note. Deep, warm, sugary sweetness building up underneath that. I just keeps getting sweeter and sweeter. Moderate density to the inhale, although it's a bit hard to taste much underneath that floral note. Exhale is a little more complex. Very flat candy raspberry up front, with those same aggressive floral top notes. Again, nothing realistic, juicy, or fleshy here. Just straight candy.  Intensely sweet base with a chemical, bitter edge.  Lingering sweetness and perfumey lychee notes.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Very aggressive. Heavy artificial bitter floral edge like a bad lychee flavor, some of that plastic-y lychee to it as well. Weird generic fruitiness, especially noticeable at lower percentages.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Moderate fresh, settles down pretty quickly with a steep but still has a weird bitterness that has a bite.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This is a bit hard to recommend. It does a candy raspberry okay, but those off flavors are pretty aggressive and it's actually sweet to the point that, personally, it's a bit offensive.  This may be a candidate for using with the RF SC Candy Base and RF SC Taffy Base. I feel like the way they beat up on flavors might actually help mellow this down to the point where it's a bit more pleasant.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, this is pretty interesting. There is a lot of flavor down at .25%, but it doesn't taste much like a raspberry. It almost tastes like a generic fruit candy base. It's fruity, but damn if I can nail down what it actually tastes like right now.  It's a chemical candy taste with a bitter edge, kind of a juicy fruit gum flavor. .5% tastes a little more like a berry, but that generic fruit candy sweetness is still pretty distracting. Almost taking on a lychee flavor, with a sort of bitter, perfurmey edge on top of that candy sweetness.  1% is where I start to get something feels more like a raspberry. Still has that perfumey edge to it, but the generic fruit taste has come together a bit and I'm getting some clear berry flavor. Kind of hard to pin down which berry, but I'll believe raspberry.  At 1.5%,  clearer raspberry. Still tastes artificial, but at least it tastes like an artificial raspberry. 2% has a full candy raspberry, still with that bitter, artificial edge. 3% has that artificial edge become medicinal and really aggressive, and by 4% this is actually bitter to point where it's hard to vape.  I'd probably stick to 2-2.5%, but you aren't getting anything but aggressively artificial raspberry candy.\n\nThis seems to change noticeably based on a steep.  It's probably not right to call it \"fading\" per se, but it seems to lose a lot of the brighter raspberry notes and turn into a flatter candy flavor even within a week.  Those generic sort of juicy fruit flavors seems to catch up to whatever brighter recognizable raspberry is in here.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nPretty thin documentation.\n\n[I got this off BCF as Super Concentrates, but apparently is the same flavoring sold on Vaping Zone as VZ SC flavoring. A couple of reviews on that site, all on the positive side. User \"Shane Bappe\" decided to review it twice.  The first review: \"Pretty good raspberry flavor but start very very low with this one. Even like .5%. It has a tendency to stick to wicks too. It is a very dominating flavor which is good, but not always what I'm looking for in raspberry. If you start extra weak, you should be fine.\" The second is a little less qualified: \"This is the best raspberry flavoring I have found thus far. It does have a slight chemically (if that's what you'd call it) taste but it seems to have steeped out after only about 12 hours. It's not even a bad taste, I kind of like it initially with the other flavors I have it mixed with. It gives it a kick. But it does seem to go away after a few hours and give me the true raspberry flavor.\"  User GD calls it a \"great Raspberry flavor, but be careful, it's strong. I used 1% in 5ml, and after 4 weeks (I stay ahead of myself) it was perfect.\"](https://www.vapingzone.com/Raspberry-Concentrated-Flavor/pid-534.html)\n\n[User /u/skettios/ (from 3 years ago) says: \"Vaping Zone Raspberry super concentrate definitely tastes like a raspberry, it's got kind of a harsh odor though, my wife says it smells like chili peppers.

After the 2 to 3 week mark it starts to lose a bit of brightness, becoming more of a light syrupy apple taste while still holding the subtle apple pie spice note.  The spice part slightly resembles a sweet clove/pine note for lack of better description.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Every once in a while this gives me a hint of a over-ripe or bruised apple, not exactly a deal-breaker though.\n\n**Throat hit:** 6/10, starts off a bit harsh but seems to mellow out after a few puffs.\n\n**Uses:** 1-3% to give a layer of depth to existing fruits.  This might need to be pushed to 4-6% to be a main note, but keep in mind some stronger flavorings might take over this rather delicate taste.\n\n**Pairings:**   FA Fuji, fleshy or stone fruits, cinnamon, light pastry or crust type flavors, lighter tobaccos.  I can see FA Meringue or another sweet light cream-type flavor helping this one out as well, however I think a thicker cream is going to mute this out unless a higher (5+) percent is used.\n\n**Notes:** I would try to avoid pairing with citrus unless you are using this as an accent or supporting flavor.  It likely won't stand up to dark or bold flavors, as it is rather delicate and meek.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** SC Seven, 3%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 7 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Cigarette paper, with some woody and floral accents and a relatively light citrus tartness.  Not a heavy tobacco, and no noticeable ash note. Reminds me a lot of TPA Western, as it seems to have that same kind of dry cigarette paper note.  Top notes have a floralish lightness to them, shoutout to \"Kinnickinnick\" in the second opinions for calling sandalwood or cedar, because after reading that it seems to fit.  Maybe a little too light and airy to really read as sandalwood to me, but it has some of the same characteristics. There's a lemon tartness in here too, but that seems to be fairly common with the SC flavors I've tried so that might just be the carrier getting weird. There's a light chocolate-y note here that starts off just a bit nutty but comes together as a bit fuller at 2% and up. Light sweetness that can get just a tiny bit of a caramel edge at higher temperatures. Overall, relatively smooth but on the dry side. I've done a lot overdripping because it kind of feels like my wicks are drying out even when they are saturated.  Seems to suffer from the same kind of fall-off I was experiencing with the SC Fruits.  If you are going to use it, I'd stick with 2.5-3% in relatively simple mixes using short-steeping flavors and planning to use the bottle within the week.\n\nInhale is dry and tart, with some floral bordering on woody flavor.  Smooth but definitely on the airy side. There's some building sweetness that picks up just a little bit of caramel and has a dry semi-sweet chocolate kind of edge to it.  Exhale has that chocolate right up front, with a drier cigarette paper-esque taste and mouthfeel taking over shortly after.  Slightly bitter thin lemon and woodspice in the top notes. It's airy enough that it feels more floral than anything else. Not a whole lot of more solid base flavor to exhale.  I pick up a bit of a dry tobacco leaf, but it's pretty subtle and a bit lost in everything else going on here.  Mouthfeel is pretty intensely dry overall though.  I wouldn't call it harsh, but it's a little weird on the throat and It seems to dry my mouth out quite a bit and that dryness lingers after the exhale.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Always hard to decide what counts off as off-flavor in tobaccos. The lemony tartness doesn't seem to fit particularly well, and that floral/woody has some of that cleaning product / dryer sheet vibe.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Not really harsh for a tobacco, but you'll know it's there. It gets a bit dry overall and that doesn't really help the situation.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I'll probably be ranting about it for the rest of the week, but whatever is going on with these flavors, they seem to fade out very quickly.  Tasting this at 3 and 7 days, it's pretty severe.  They mellow a bit and lose some of the sharp edges, but they also lose a lot of the fullness and vibrancy.  It's extremely noticeable with fruits but it seems to be happening with the couple of other Super Concentrate flavors I've tried as well.  Just in terms of recipe balancing, I'd probably stick with Super Concentrate flavoring only mixes, maybe throwing in some flavors by different manufacturers that don't require much of a steep.\n\nFor this specifically, I feel like the tobacco note could be a lot more aggressive, and so I'd probably look at mixing this with more robust tobacco flavorings that are decent straight off a shake.  It looks like SC should have a couple of these, but you may also be able to get away with using some FLV Tobaccos and just giving up on the idea of keeping a bottle around for more than a week.\n\nThis already has a bit of cigarette paper kind of vibe to it, I think a slightly ashy, strong tobacco could drag this more into a full-on tobacco mix. I think if you're trying to accentuate some of the chocolate or nuttiness here, you're going to end up running into a situation where it will take long enough for those flavors to steep that you'll lose a lot of what's going in this concentrate.\n\nAgain, limited tobacco experience, but that kind of cigarette wrapper note hasn't ever blended particularly well with fruits or creams, although I suppose you could go nuts and start dragging in brighter citrus accents.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, at 1% this is just kind of dull and nutty.  Some of that floral note in there, although the fresh alcohol based flavor might be pushing that to the front a bit and that tartness seems pretty pronounced.  At 2%, still not getting anything too close to a tobacco.  Still feels light, thin, and airy.  That floral note is getting more woody and that nuttiness is getting closer to chocolately. At 3% there's a lot more to like about this.  The chocolate note is filling in quite a bit, and it starts to resemble a tobacco quite a bit more.  Those woody floral notes and tartness are still there, but they are better balanced by that deeper tobacco.  At 4% I feel like it's losing some of that balance again.  That chocolatey note is getting a bit weird, and the top notes are picking up some bitterness.  5% just seems to move a bit further off the rails. For all the weird issues with these flavors, they do at least seem to be fairly consistent and all of them work the best right at that 2.5-3% level.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\nNot much out there.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** SC Tropical Fruit, .5 and 2%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 9 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Mostly papaya. Whatever mix of tropical flavors they are using ends up coming across as a sweeter papaya flavor. It's a little bit sweet than the SC fruits I've tried, not quite instant candy. More like chunked up papaya in syrup or papaya nectar sweet.  Light floral edge when freshly mixed. Not as aggressive as the other SC fruits I've tried, but a nice, slightly soft papaya flavor. It fades quite a bit on a steep, so that probably needs to be accounted for. I'd use as a sweet but fairly bright papaya on a short steep or shake and vape, and a sweet background note on a longer steep. S&V percentage is around 2%, with a longer steep I'd go up to 3-4% but I still wouldn't expect more than a couple of weeks out of it.\n\nInhale is a bit sharp, with some lighter florals. Deep, sweeter papaya base. I know this is theoretically \"tropical fruit\" but it just tastes like papaya to me. Heavy fruit sweetness, not quite candy sweetness. Small bit of harshness in there and maybe a bit more airy than I'd like. Exhale has papaya right up front. Some very subtle tartness, but it helps set off the heavier, sweeter base. Light floral top notes. Not really realistic, but cooked, syrupy papaya flavor. A little light overall, doesn't really envelop the palate. Just a bit airy, with a really clean finish.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Nah, it all tastes like tropical and like fruit.  I was maybe expecting more of a blend of fruits, but I'll settle for just the papaya.  There's a bit of a floral edge, but it's nothing major.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light fresh, basically nothing steeped.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  It all depends how quickly you plan on using this. \n\nFreshly mixed and within about 3 days, I'd use this as a brighter, sweet papaya in fruit mixes, with creams as a sweeter take on a tropical milkshake or something, pair with citruses, or the base for a tropical candy flavor.\n\nIf it's going to steep for a while, I'd either crank the percentage up, or just use it sweet, tropical background noise in mixes with brigher, acidic fruit like pineapple or passionfruit.  Almost like the tropical version of apple or white grape juice in actual blended fruit juices.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nConcentration testing, again this is going to vary based on a steep. At .25%, very light sweetness feels very weak. At .5% it's still light and a little soft.  The steeped sample at .5% is very light.  Nice, pleasant sweetness but not too much to it.  1 and 1.5% still feel pretty light to me. The papaya flavor is starting to come through but it's pretty one-dimensional without a tarter, brighter note.  2% Fresh is where this really starts to come together for me. Mix picks up a good deal of sweetness, but you're getting some good brighter, slightly tart flavor to balance it out. The steeped 2% test is still sweet, but it tastes pretty flat. 3% is getting a bit perfumey for me, and 4% is too perfumey and sharp at least fresh.\n\nThis fades. A lot. This is pretty neat freshly mixed, but after a week the flavor gets fairly vague and just tastes sweet.  The fade on this is probably the most extreme of the limited SC fruits I've tasted.  I'm not sure if it's the volatiles or the alcohol base, but it's a bummer.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nI can't find a damn thing.\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**\n\nH/T to /u/IDI0-T for the suggestion.\n\n[Bonus video review link for a couple of SC Fruits.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvX1V5-8BD0)",

    "markdown": "**Setup:** Recoil w/ flavor barrel, Dual 15 wrap 26g 3mm Nifethal 70 coils @.13 ohms.  60w power, 450F temp limit. Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Sasami Gooseberry, .5% and 1.5%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 20 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Somewhere between green grape skins, tomatillos, and cactus with way more sweetness than seems appropriate. I've never had a real european gooseberry, and trying to figure out how they are supposed to taste has been... difficult. I'm assuming this is modeled after Eurasian gooseberries and apparently the flavor on those varies wildly based on cultivar. Basically, I've been able to ascertain that it should be tart / sour and sweet, and that it's somewhere closer to a grape / apple / pear flavor than a more recognizable berry. I could dig a sour grape flavor... this doesn't really taste like sour grapes. It's pretty odd.\n\nInhale is green and astringent. Underripe fruit here, but pretty heavily sweetened. That astringency is actually scary accurate to underripe fruit. It's very tannic and dry.  I'd say tannic like dry red wine, but it feels like more a of a green grape flavor. A bit on the airy side.  Exhale has a pretty intense savory flavor up front. It doesn't really feel like it belongs in there with that sweetness. It's hard to describe but that tannic green grape skin in the inhale picks up more of a green aloe note and starts to push even further into savory and gets a bit of an acidic tomatillo. There's some sweet fruit in there, but it's pretty generic. I could see maybe apple-ish or white grape fruityness, but that greener flavor is pushing that fruityness into just being a background sweetness. No real distinct floral notes, but that vegetal green has a sharper edge to it. Sweetness feels really cloying to me based on that green flavor. I don't think I would mind this nearly as much if you got more sour and tart than that heavy sweetness.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Again, not acquainted with actual gooseberries, but there is a whole lot here that doesn't really taste pleasant, at least to my big dumb 'murican palate.  It seems oversweet, and very green with some weirdly savory notes.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Lightly harsh. That astringency does weird things to your throat though.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I feel like I've editorialized quite a bit, but this is going to be a really hard flavor to use if your preferences in a vape are anything like mine. I can see maybe using this at a small percentage as an additive for a realistic apple or grape skin note.  The taste isn't too far off from grape skins coated in sugar, and that astringency really is impressively accurate.\n\nThe intense sweetness might make it a decent sweetener for really green, herbal mixes.\n\nIf you like INW Cactus, but complain it doesn't feel enough like shoving raw cactus in your mouth, then knock yourself out with this.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing this was unpleasant. At .5% it's mostly sweet astringency. Less complexity, but less savory.  There are still some green notes, but it feels relatively light. At 1.5% it doesn't feel that much sweeter or astringent, but all of those green notes come in hard. Sasami recommends mixing this at 3-5% and I apparently have a death wish. Vaping this at 3%, it's very green. Stealing one of the second opinions, I can definitely see the tequila comparison here. It feels really close to the agave notes from blanco tequila and that sweetness makes me think of cheap tequila. At 5% it's actually a surprisingly well built flavor, that sweetness and those green notes feel pretty well in balance. It just tastes gnarly.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[One note of substance on ELR, god bless user \"NiDrO\":\"dark, sweet, figs/tequila very strong.\" User \"furble\" calls it a \"nice strong, tart gooseberry.\"](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/127285)\n\n[Also, really interesting recipe from \"VHM\" on ELR.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Sasami Sweet Blackberry, 1 and 2.5%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 19 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Sasami is a flavoring company, auf deutsch! They had a couple flavors available on Chef's when I made my last order and decided to give them a shot. I figured why not give their blackberry a try to see if they were some kind of teutonic flavor wizards who managed to actually do a realistic blackberry flavor right... and the results are pretty meh. Flavor feels pretty disjointed. There's actually a really good, dark, jammy blackberry here but it's fighting with a pretty regrettable floral note that tastes awfully similar to FA Blackberry but markedly less intense (not like it's hard though.) Overall effect is like blackberry jam mixed with perfume.  I'd probably skip this one because of that floral note, but if you did want to use this I would aim for about 3%.\n\nInhale is mostly florals. Very perfumey and slightly bitter.  Just enough sweet, jammy blackberry underneath to be frustrating. Moderate density on the base, but that floral note is sharp and thin. Exhale is all sorts of floral in the top notes. Jammy blackberry base comes through a little clearer on the exhale, but it's still taking a backseat to the floral. Very natural jammy sweetness to the blackberry. Moderately harsh, but I feel like it's mostly from the floral notes. Lingering perfume. \n\n**Off-flavors:** Hella floral. More going on underneath than FA Blackberry, but same kind of perfumey / soapy floral note. The blackberry also has a tendency to get ketchup-ish at higher percentages.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Moderate. Those florals are pretty harsh.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Eh, I'm not digging it really. I've never found a happy place with that perfumey note.  It just tastes bad floral to me. I suppose you could mix with this for a jammy blackberry and steep it for a couple months and hope some of that dies off a bit.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, I'm not finding a percentage where the off-flavors really work. At 1% it's pretty floral. There is some jammier blackberry, but it's pretty light compared to that full floral perfume. At 2.5% that blackberry is a bit stronger, but that floral note is still dominating for me. It's a shame, because that blackberry really is pretty good. At 4%, I'm starting to get some ketchup-y savoryness to the blackberry, like TPA Sweet Raspberry when you overdo it. Florals are still distractingly strong. Taking some advice from the second opinions, I tried this at 10%. Don't do that. It's moved from blackberry jam with perfume to ketchup with perfume.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Product page from Sasami. Their description: \"Sweet blackberry for all fruit experts.\"  Are you a fruit expert?  The only reviews I can find seem to all come from this product page. User \"Steffi\" says via google translate: \"Need a significantly higher concentration than 5%. Habs now with about 10%. Then it is very delicious.

    "markdown": "Finally got around to testing some of my SM stuff. I'm the worst at describing a flavor so feel free to trash the notes, disagree or suggest notes to include. I'm mostly publishing them front page because there's so little information on them here so they'd be searchable. I mixed them all up over a month ago and just never got around to testing them due to life priorities. I usually use them in an mtl tank and wasn't blown away by any of them. Tried them all this time in the c4 (adv ss claptons 0.43 at 52W) and there was a huge difference in flavor. I know there's some subtlety lost in mtl vaping but this was remarkable. I think they just deliver better in higher concentrations. Most were tested at the max suggested use and I think that's definitely where you should start if planning to vape solo, test,  or mix right off the bat. These are just my first pass private notes going public. This is not meant to be exhaustive and im not into working too hard so they're just impressions compared to how they were described by the SM website. My hope is that you get more of an idea of which ones to try if you're looking at them at all and willing to deal with the price and rewicking.\n\n**Overall impression**: The flavors are very different from INW or FLV baccos im more familiar with. They are expensive and not cost efficient at all. These are for the tobacco lover who wants a very 'clean' flavored tobacco juice. There was almost no ash in any of them I could really taste but a few gave the 'impression' of ashiness by being bolder or darker. i think all of them could be paired with just about anything since they're so clean, but because they are relatively less aggressive in general, i'd lean towards lighter or less aggressive pairings. Fruits, accents, etc. Also they are all very sweet in general so I can see all of them leaning into an ry2-5 profile with ease.\n\nOn the whole, they lack off notes (and probably on notes too if used too low), unless you consider the natural sweetness an off note. It feels that way sometimes.\n\nRecipes on atf are lacking but there's a bunch on [ELR](https://e-liquid-recipes.com/list?q=Stixx+Mixx).\n\n# Flavors\n\n**SM American Virginian - 12% slightly sweet american styled cigarette.**\n\n*SM: The perfect base note to your tobacco creations. Smooth, Medium to bold American cigarette, full bodied, slightly sweet, red type, Thick mouth feel, (0 to trace) out of (10) throat hit. Use @ 8% Preferred single flavor mix at 10-12%*\n\nI feel this has a medium body and is very sweet. Im guessing 'red type' means marlboro styled? Maybe. What do I know? I disagree about the mouthfeel. It lacks a little body like so many other SM NETs. Sort of plain cigarette flavor with hints of dark fruit like raisin. This could be a good base to mid note for a cigarette. I'd want some more flavor, mixed with something that had some accent notes, maybe a fruit to pair with the sweetness? Definitely want something to fill it out some more.\n\nrelatable flavors: like a sweeter lighter HS ry1?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Havana Primed - 6% Cigar styled aroma**\n\n*SM: A fuller rich cigar, like a big stogie. Very smooth light leaf wrapper with a nice filler.  Stands wonderfully by itself, still the light leaf wrapper but the boldness of the filler comes through. Recommend 2 week steep. Use @ 4-6%*\n\nMe: Sweet cigar stlyed tobacco. Body and a hint of wrapper. I'm not getting any chocolate notes, no coffee notes. I guess my standard is Flv CT shade which is a firggin bully. This is definitely full bodied and smooth at 6%. Not deep either. Not sure i'd vape this as a stand alone. Leaves me wanting more bottom notes to make it more realistic cigar. Something to anchor it down. Maybe add some dnb to make it more realistic?\n\nRecipe: sole atf [https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/47803#vanilla\\_tobacco\\_by\\_sixstrings952](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/47803#vanilla_tobacco_by_sixstrings952)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Whiskey Cavendish - 10% Tobacco Blend with a Whiskey flavoring**\n\n*SM: Whiskey Cavendish is a mixture of Burley, Virginia and Black Cavendish tobaccos with an outstanding whiskey flavoring recipe to achieve a remarkable flavor and aroma – mellow but satisfying. Use @ 8-10%*\n\nMe: finally a complex flavor. I like this one, I can taste the whiskey in it but it's a slightly sweet flavor more than a boozy note. This works as a complex stand alone. There;s lots to this aroma. The bacco blend hits all the points i like. I think this works as a stand alone and shows what can be done with these flavors and the right blend/mix.\n\nRelatable flavors: Much less bold The Southerner. Like a southerner one shot lite.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Aged Burley - 10%**\n\n*SM: A mid to full bodied smoke. When mixed in with a lighter shag, it brings out the manly back notes that you may desire. Earthy, nice throat hit. Use @ 6-10%*\n\nMe: great smell off this one before i even tried it. Slight nutty taste and only a hint of sweet. I like the body on this one, full and low. It could stand as the main note in a mix. Definitely not kidding about the throat hit. It feels like just the right mid-base note, but not as in your face as the FLV version. perhaps they are right about the 'manly back notes' (is that hairiness?). I'd maybe pair this with sweet brightleaf? If you are used to Flv Red Burley, this is a much more mellow nuttiness yet also an as distinct flavor. If you are tired of flv RB then I'd get this one.\n\nRelatable flavors: Much less bold Flv Red burley.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Brazilian Viso - 10%**\n\n*SM: A nice dry, not sweet shag. In the medium range it can provide body to many a mix. Use as a filler with some Nicaraguan Seco or Burley. Steep minimum of 2 weeks for full flavor. Use @ 6-8% standalone @ 10%*\n\nMe: Noticeably less sweet than the rest. Maybe not necessarily in a good way but I could see this being added to one of the sweeter ones to bring it down a notch. Has a nice woody flavor that is very different from the rest. rather enjoyable on it's own and I could see this being the 'cured for body' fix for the NET range at 4-6%. At 10% it doesnt seem to hold up to the complexity of the WC or HP. Not sure how much filler burley needs. I'd like to pair it with something that will play well with the woody notes. American Virginian or the Burley perhaps?\n\nRelatable flavors: Hints of woody like Vanilla for pipe but without the vanilla/pipe-y muskiness. And not as strong; just a hint. Definitely more of a cig type.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Supreme - 6% Tobacco Blend**\n\nSM: *A nice combination of three different shags….Nicaraguan Ligero Filler,Connecticut Broadleaf Binder,and Havana Wrapper. For a bold and smooth taste! Use @ 6-10%*\n\nMe: Tried this at the lower end for once. Big Mistake, meaning I just want more. Surprisingly the flavor is there but im not picking up the flavor like the other samples and i regret it because this has a very good flavor as a stand alone. This one is complex enough to be vaped solo. Only a hint of sweet, the combination flavor here is working to make a nice well rounded tobacco. At 6, it’s not failing to deliver the flavor, I just can’t get behind it this low, despite it being dark and rich.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Wild strawberry Tea - 8% Green tea w/SB**\n\nSM: Japanese Sencha green tea with a refreshing strawberry and papaya. Recommended at 4-8%\n\nMe: at 8% this delivers a powerful SB flavor. Slightly floral with a decent throat hit, it’s sweet with a little bit of green from the tea, a nice match. Not a green like a stem from a strawberry, but just adding to the fullness of the flavor. It’s a nice complement. Not sure im picking up on the papaya at all. Sweet almost powdery sugar. I might add some SB flavoring to this to round it out a bit if i wanted a fuller SB but it works here solo. The tea is not very pronounced and low in the background as that slight green, not astringent, just a hint. I dont think I would mess with this too much. Maybe just something to boost the tea notes or fill out the berry? Maybe just use this in place of SB in some regular recipes since I am not crazy for the SB sweets. Definitely worth the test.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion**: The Supreme or Whiskey Cavendish if you want an all-in-one flavor good to go. Overall, not nearly as good in mtl imo; the subtlety that makes them so smooth and fun to vape is lost. Not really cost effective but for the tobacco lovers, they are worth a try and really interesting to vape. I find that when I switch back over to the flv/inw mixes i have, I feel they are clumsy and overbearing at first by comparison to the SM flavors. As a general statement, they were all pretty sweet so if that's a problem, go Brazilian Viso for sure for a less sweet cig style. The tea was an interesting vape more for the SB flavor (which isn't really my passion) and seemed so forward compared to any combination of SB i've ever had. Thanks for reading, hope this helps!",

At 10% it doesnt seem to hold up to the complexity of the WC or HP. Not sure how much filler burley needs. I'd like to pair it with something that will play well with the woody notes. American Virginian or the Burley perhaps?\n\nRelatable flavors: Hints of woody like Vanilla for pipe but without the vanilla/pipe-y muskiness. And not as strong; just a hint. Definitely more of a cig type.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Supreme - 6% Tobacco Blend**\n\nSM: *A nice combination of three different shags….Nicaraguan Ligero Filler,Connecticut Broadleaf Binder,and Havana Wrapper. For a bold and smooth taste! Use @ 6-10%*\n\nMe: Tried this at the lower end for once. Big Mistake, meaning I just want more. Surprisingly the flavor is there but im not picking up the flavor like the other samples and i regret it because this has a very good flavor as a stand alone. This one is complex enough to be vaped solo. Only a hint of sweet, the combination flavor here is working to make a nice well rounded tobacco. At 6, it’s not failing to deliver the flavor, I just can’t get behind it this low, despite it being dark and rich.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Wild strawberry Tea - 8% Green tea w/SB**\n\nSM: Japanese Sencha green tea with a refreshing strawberry and papaya. Recommended at 4-8%\n\nMe: at 8% this delivers a powerful SB flavor. Slightly floral with a decent throat hit, it’s sweet with a little bit of green from the tea, a nice match. Not a green like a stem from a strawberry, but just adding to the fullness of the flavor. It’s a nice complement. Not sure im picking up on the papaya at all. Sweet almost powdery sugar. I might add some SB flavoring to this to round it out a bit if i wanted a fuller SB but it works here solo. The tea is not very pronounced and low in the background as that slight green, not astringent, just a hint. I dont think I would mess with this too much. Maybe just something to boost the tea notes or fill out the berry? Maybe just use this in place of SB in some regular recipes since I am not crazy for the SB sweets. Definitely worth the test.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion**: The Supreme or Whiskey Cavendish if you want an all-in-one flavor good to go. Overall, not nearly as good in mtl imo; the subtlety that makes them so smooth and fun to vape is lost. Not really cost effective but for the tobacco lovers, they are worth a try and really interesting to vape. I find that when I switch back over to the flv/inw mixes i have, I feel they are clumsy and overbearing at first by comparison to the SM flavors. As a general statement, they were all pretty sweet so if that's a problem, go Brazilian Viso for sure for a less sweet cig style. The tea was an interesting vape more for the SB flavor (which isn't really my passion) and seemed so forward compared to any combination of SB i've ever had. Thanks for reading, hope this helps!",

Spoiler: I maybe thought that overall those were better flavors. Perhaps that’s because they were my first go round and so I had zero expectations? I don’t know, but these things matter. This time, I tried a small handful of flavors and it still took me forever to review them! Anyway, I usually vape them mtl but for the purposes of the review, all were tested in a c4 dtl for focusing on the flavors. Mtl, they do function a bit differently in my experience and can lose some of the subtlety that makes them rather interesting to vape. All flavors were steeped 3 weeks in 70/30 vg/pg solution for dtl vaping. A reminder that these are NETs (Naturally Extracted Tobaccos) and require frequent rewicking should you choose to take the plunge. Enjoy!\n\n# Flavors\n\n**Butter Rum Cavendish (Tested at 10%)**\n\n*SM: This delicious flavor is expertly blended with Golden Virginia and mellow White Burley. The Cavendish style blend is then topped with a subtle mixture of Buttered New England and Jamaican Rums that produce a bite-free taste.Use @ 6-10% \\*NETs are pre-steeped use as any other flavoring\\**\n\nMe: Definitely smooth all around. It’s not really striking me as overly bacco or booze. It’s definitely modestly both, in a way. Frankly, I’m not sure I’m appreciating the buttery rum flavor as it plays with the bright bacco back finish. I definitely lean more towards bolder tobacco flavors and this one is much much milder than I prefer. The Virginia here does have a bit of sweet which blends into the rum. Had this after a few sips of coffee and wow the butter rum came out. Im positive that this would pair well with coffee and, dare I say ice cream? Maybe not my favorite SM flavor to date, but otherwise an interesting milder flavorful mix and it grew on me asI vaped it. With a few hints or accents I could see this making a unique adv with its lighter flavor and cavendish sweetness on the palate, although I’m not sure what that could be without being overpowering this subtle flavor, maybe some oak accents?\n\n**Sweet Brightleaf (tested at 10%)**\n\n*SM: Exactly that,…a light, bright, loose leaf shag with earthy notes. Layer with other light-medium shags for a nice full bodied taste. Could be used when a light woodsy note is needed. Also use combined with other earthy flavors to create a great tea. Use @ 4-6% – 10% Standalone.* \n\nThe dog: I was expecting something that wouldn’t stand alone from the description of it layering, but it does the shag moniker justice. And it doesn’t strike me as sweet in the way that FLV sweet cigarette does, this has a brightness and for sure a lovely earthy woody note. At first I felt it was ashy, but that was that prominent woody note coming through clearly. Layered in, I don’t see this as a neutral filler at all, and I could easily see this maybe mixing with something a little sweeter to balance out that earthy depth. I’m pretty sure I will eventually add some DNB to this one and vape it solo again. I think the name is a little misleading and I almost expected it to be like those golden nutty rolling tobaccos I used to buy. This one does have the capacity to stand on its own as a bright medium with sweet and complex earthy musky notes and I’m sure could be bent lighter or darker. As I keep vaping this I really do get a different flavors making this a kind of unpredictable surprise and potentially difficult to mix with, luckily it seems have been able to stand alone quite fine.\n\n**Honduran Liguero (tested at 10% - often used in my adv at 5%)**\n\n*SM: A great, smooth shag flavor. Lightly sweet, and very very smooth. Excellent standalone, or with dark berries. Use @ 5-10% \\*NETs are pre-steeped use as any other flavoring\\**\n\nThe dawg: While not my first rodeo with this flavor, I decided to include it in this roundup and test it again at max like I did all the other flavors. I almost dont recognize it as I’ve been vaping it at 4 or 5 % with 1% flv acai for damn near three months. At the low end of 5ish percent, it’s modest and can hang with acai quite nicely. Acai slips in and does its weird bold berry without the funky off notes. I love it and it’s light enough to be a 3 month (literally) dedicated tank so I’m going to go ahead and pre thumb up this one. But, again, at 10, it’s a totally different vape than I’m used to. Great mouthfeel, like really round and full. That must be what they meant by “smooth”, but it really comes across as full for me. While it is flavorful enough at 5, at 10 it delivers. It delivers sweetness that is never overpowering (and often just perfect) and some darker complexity in the smoke. I’ve tried a few darker berries with it at 5 and they overpowered the delicate nuances of the bacco easily so I think this will have to be tried again with Liguero at 10 because I see this shining. I think when I mixed that, I was trying to make my 10ml sample of this flavor last because I liked it so much, keep my rewicking to a minimum and costs down. All that is out the window now. I would say this is a great stand alone with potential to receive more popular fruit flavors for the fruit heads that want to dabble. Be warned it’s dark medium blend but it’s really darned good.\n\n**Turkish Oriental (tested at 8%)**\n\n*SM: A perfect dry shag, on its own or mixed with your favorite flavors! Use @ 4-8% \\*NETs are pre-steeped use as any other flavoring\\**\n\nDoggo: yes, dry. Not in a bad way at all but like a pack of cigarettes that has been open for a week and all that raisin smell is gone, it’s just like 3 ciggies left in the pack and they’ve had the room to air out. There’s a hint of spice but it’s really super light compared to say, FLV turkish. It kind of reminds me of a more complex version of some of HS’s drier tobaccos like Ry1 or No5. Also, there’s a sweetness here that isn’t exactly evident at first but it is rather sweet when I focus on it. I kind of like how it’s got that sweet and dry thing going on, but also I’ve been on a crazy kick of ry4’s and sweet cig style vapes. I don’t know, I can’t tell you how authentic this is to an aromatic turkish oriental tobacco, but my tongue is saying this could be used as a less neutral body filler to dry up a bit of another concentrate. Maybe pair it with Sweet Brightleaf and get that spicy woody a little dried up? Like in a 1:2 SBL : TO?\n\n**Black Cavendish (Tested at 10%)**\n\n*SM: Similar to a black and mild, without the really darker notes. At 6% it’s a light version of your grandpa’s pipe. Very smooth, lots of flavor without the burnt taste. At 10% much more bold, with earthy back notes.  Add some dark fire cured for that authentic pipe.*\n\nIsuwasadog: After spending the last 3 weeks on various FLV Cavendish recipes (holy gunking -- like NET level!) not sure what I was expecting here. FLV is really sweet and syrupy pipe for me and this one was advertised as a Black and Mild which is a cigar, yeah? And so I was thinking, I don’t know, cheap cigar. I’m now curious about the 6% (I never knew my Grandpa or that he smoked a pipe) at 10% it’s pretty dark, maybe even a little too dark for me even. It feels kind of one note which is partly why I suspect they added that tip to add dark fired cured for some authenticity. Makes me wonder what DFC does to the mix. I got some SM from nomnomz that is labeled SM Dark Fire and there’s only one [Dark Fire](https://www.stixxmixx.com/product/dark-fire/) no Dark Fire Cured. I think there is a Latakia Dark Fire as well but I’m guessing that’s not it. I think I’m gonna put this on hold and squirt a little bit of Dark fire in there and review it again on the next round. For now, this shows promise, especially if it really does hold the flavor at 6% because that would mean that it’s one of the more cost effective concentrates they have.\n\n**Nicaraguan Seco (tested at 8%)**\n\n*SM: The building block of any great cigar always starts here. Mellow and smooth tobacco taste, with some nutty undertones help put this blend right on top in any cigar or pipe blend you can imagine. Use @ 4-8% \\*NETs are pre-steeped use as any other flavoring\\**\n\nMe: Honestly, I didnt get a whole lot from this one.I tried it and just felt it lacked flavor. Figured that I was suffering from olfactory fatigue and tried it again in the morning the next day. Tried it again later that day. Tried it again the following day. Trying it again right now. I’m getting a reaaaaaaallly soft tobacco flavor, barely noticeable. I get no nutty notes, barely anything. I know that I lean towards bolder flavors in general and this just may be too subtle for my wrecked palate. Possible but I think the 8% cap is low here. I should probably retest at 10% or more, but I’m not feeling it. With all the other ones available that are excellent, I’m going to say this one is a hard pass. Maybe it does something in a mix, as per the SM notes and, since I already have it I may give it a try, but I wouldn’t recommend picking it up for a purchase.\n\n**Canadian Virginian (tested at 10%)**\n\n*SM: Canadian is a light to medium shag, Generally used as a filler or to tie others together. 4-8% and 10% standalone was very throaty after 2 week steep. Lightly earthy. All in all very satisfying.*\n\nMe: I get the filler aspect of this. Low on the sweetness, mostly body, at three weeks didn’t notice some exceptional throat hit. I’d even say barely noticeable to me (but hey I like throat hit). It has that brightness you’d expect from a Virginia but it’s pretty well rooted in some Hobbit leaf Middle Earthy tobacco flavors to round it out a bit.Perhaps I’ve gone a little mad? Maybe not the best stand alone, but I could see this brightening a darker mix slightly or rounding out the mid-range flavors.  \n\n# Conclusion:\n\nWell, I tried to do this all in one sitting so that I could remember all the impressions I had but that Nicaraguan Seco tripped me up and delayed the whole process. So now I’m really left with just impressions and I’m not wildly impressed by these. The surprise flavors were the Sweet Brightleaf which I had tried before and was not really impressed by at the time, and the Honduran Liguero which I had used prior but for some reason had never pushed to its limit. The unusual one for me was the Butter Rum Cavendish. I was expecting something different and it took me a sec to wrap my head around what I was actually getting rather than what was expected. For a more flavorful blend, I’d stick with the Whiskey Cavendish I reviewed in Part I of these notes. But if you want cavendish lite, with some rather unusual notes, I’d say take a chance on this one. I did end up trying Turkish Oriental at near 14% for shits and giggles and not sure it came through much more clearly since I’d switched to an mtl tank, but it held its own.\n\nIn all, I wasn’t as impressed with this bunch as stand alones. Granted these were first impressions, however I think these flavors will require some blending and I look forward to experimenting with them to create blends. I think these are the best uses here and I’ll take that challenge. It’s almost too easy to just get the Supreme, American Virginian, Honduran Liguero, or the Whiskey Cavendish and just have at it as a stand alone. I’d like to see what I can do with this supporting cast and see what vaping 20% of a NET will do to my coils in 2ml. At least, now that I own them.\n\nI think the NET love is still there, but we go in phases. I see this one maybe ending in a while, but next month I have a few others to review so keep your eyes peeled for that. I also just started experimenting with additives to elevate them and make fuller and more well rounded mixes... or you can just go find the recipes by Kopel, Stixx and Bogenshizzle on [elr](https://e-liquid-recipes.com/list?q=stixx+mixx&missing=0&recipesonly=0&adaptedfrom=&sort=recipe.created&direction=asc).\n\nTitle improvement, apex?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nKeep mixin’ kids,\n\n\\- i\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPS Additional Recipe: [Acai Bacco](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/151167) Will need to update this one when I try it again at 10% and see if I can’t round out that berry flavor some more.

    "markdown": "Finally got around to testing some of my SM stuff. I'm the worst at describing a flavor so feel free to trash the notes, disagree or suggest notes to include. I'm mostly publishing them front page because there's so little information on them here so they'd be searchable. I mixed them all up over a month ago and just never got around to testing them due to life priorities. I usually use them in an mtl tank and wasn't blown away by any of them. Tried them all this time in the c4 (adv ss claptons 0.43 at 52W) and there was a huge difference in flavor. I know there's some subtlety lost in mtl vaping but this was remarkable. I think they just deliver better in higher concentrations. Most were tested at the max suggested use and I think that's definitely where you should start if planning to vape solo, test,  or mix right off the bat. These are just my first pass private notes going public. This is not meant to be exhaustive and im not into working too hard so they're just impressions compared to how they were described by the SM website. My hope is that you get more of an idea of which ones to try if you're looking at them at all and willing to deal with the price and rewicking.\n\n**Overall impression**: The flavors are very different from INW or FLV baccos im more familiar with. They are expensive and not cost efficient at all. These are for the tobacco lover who wants a very 'clean' flavored tobacco juice. There was almost no ash in any of them I could really taste but a few gave the 'impression' of ashiness by being bolder or darker. i think all of them could be paired with just about anything since they're so clean, but because they are relatively less aggressive in general, i'd lean towards lighter or less aggressive pairings. Fruits, accents, etc. Also they are all very sweet in general so I can see all of them leaning into an ry2-5 profile with ease.\n\nOn the whole, they lack off notes (and probably on notes too if used too low), unless you consider the natural sweetness an off note. It feels that way sometimes.\n\nRecipes on atf are lacking but there's a bunch on [ELR](https://e-liquid-recipes.com/list?q=Stixx+Mixx).\n\n# Flavors\n\n**SM American Virginian - 12% slightly sweet american styled cigarette.**\n\n*SM: The perfect base note to your tobacco creations. Smooth, Medium to bold American cigarette, full bodied, slightly sweet, red type, Thick mouth feel, (0 to trace) out of (10) throat hit. Use @ 8% Preferred single flavor mix at 10-12%*\n\nI feel this has a medium body and is very sweet. Im guessing 'red type' means marlboro styled? Maybe. What do I know? I disagree about the mouthfeel. It lacks a little body like so many other SM NETs. Sort of plain cigarette flavor with hints of dark fruit like raisin. This could be a good base to mid note for a cigarette. I'd want some more flavor, mixed with something that had some accent notes, maybe a fruit to pair with the sweetness? Definitely want something to fill it out some more.\n\nrelatable flavors: like a sweeter lighter HS ry1?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Havana Primed - 6% Cigar styled aroma**\n\n*SM: A fuller rich cigar, like a big stogie. Very smooth light leaf wrapper with a nice filler.  Stands wonderfully by itself, still the light leaf wrapper but the boldness of the filler comes through. Recommend 2 week steep. Use @ 4-6%*\n\nMe: Sweet cigar stlyed tobacco. Body and a hint of wrapper. I'm not getting any chocolate notes, no coffee notes. I guess my standard is Flv CT shade which is a firggin bully. This is definitely full bodied and smooth at 6%. Not deep either. Not sure i'd vape this as a stand alone. Leaves me wanting more bottom notes to make it more realistic cigar. Something to anchor it down. Maybe add some dnb to make it more realistic?\n\nRecipe: sole atf [https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/47803#vanilla\\_tobacco\\_by\\_sixstrings952](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/47803#vanilla_tobacco_by_sixstrings952)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Whiskey Cavendish - 10% Tobacco Blend with a Whiskey flavoring**\n\n*SM: Whiskey Cavendish is a mixture of Burley, Virginia and Black Cavendish tobaccos with an outstanding whiskey flavoring recipe to achieve a remarkable flavor and aroma – mellow but satisfying. Use @ 8-10%*\n\nMe: finally a complex flavor. I like this one, I can taste the whiskey in it but it's a slightly sweet flavor more than a boozy note. This works as a complex stand alone. There;s lots to this aroma. The bacco blend hits all the points i like. I think this works as a stand alone and shows what can be done with these flavors and the right blend/mix.\n\nRelatable flavors: Much less bold The Southerner. Like a southerner one shot lite.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Aged Burley - 10%**\n\n*SM: A mid to full bodied smoke. When mixed in with a lighter shag, it brings out the manly back notes that you may desire. Earthy, nice throat hit. Use @ 6-10%*\n\nMe: great smell off this one before i even tried it. Slight nutty taste and only a hint of sweet. I like the body on this one, full and low. It could stand as the main note in a mix. Definitely not kidding about the throat hit. It feels like just the right mid-base note, but not as in your face as the FLV version. perhaps they are right about the 'manly back notes' (is that hairiness?). I'd maybe pair this with sweet brightleaf? If you are used to Flv Red Burley, this is a much more mellow nuttiness yet also an as distinct flavor. If you are tired of flv RB then I'd get this one.\n\nRelatable flavors: Much less bold Flv Red burley.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Brazilian Viso - 10%**\n\n*SM: A nice dry, not sweet shag. In the medium range it can provide body to many a mix. Use as a filler with some Nicaraguan Seco or Burley. Steep minimum of 2 weeks for full flavor. Use @ 6-8% standalone @ 10%*\n\nMe: Noticeably less sweet than the rest. Maybe not necessarily in a good way but I could see this being added to one of the sweeter ones to bring it down a notch. Has a nice woody flavor that is very different from the rest. rather enjoyable on it's own and I could see this being the 'cured for body' fix for the NET range at 4-6%. At 10% it doesnt seem to hold up to the complexity of the WC or HP. Not sure how much filler burley needs. I'd like to pair it with something that will play well with the woody notes. American Virginian or the Burley perhaps?\n\nRelatable flavors: Hints of woody like Vanilla for pipe but without the vanilla/pipe-y muskiness. And not as strong; just a hint. Definitely more of a cig type.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Supreme - 6% Tobacco Blend**\n\nSM: *A nice combination of three different shags….Nicaraguan Ligero Filler,Connecticut Broadleaf Binder,and Havana Wrapper. For a bold and smooth taste! Use @ 6-10%*\n\nMe: Tried this at the lower end for once. Big Mistake, meaning I just want more. Surprisingly the flavor is there but im not picking up the flavor like the other samples and i regret it because this has a very good flavor as a stand alone.

At 6, it’s not failing to deliver the flavor, I just can’t get behind it this low, despite it being dark and rich.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Wild strawberry Tea - 8% Green tea w/SB**\n\nSM: Japanese Sencha green tea with a refreshing strawberry and papaya. Recommended at 4-8%\n\nMe: at 8% this delivers a powerful SB flavor. Slightly floral with a decent throat hit, it’s sweet with a little bit of green from the tea, a nice match. Not a green like a stem from a strawberry, but just adding to the fullness of the flavor. It’s a nice complement. Not sure im picking up on the papaya at all. Sweet almost powdery sugar. I might add some SB flavoring to this to round it out a bit if i wanted a fuller SB but it works here solo. The tea is not very pronounced and low in the background as that slight green, not astringent, just a hint. I dont think I would mess with this too much. Maybe just something to boost the tea notes or fill out the berry? Maybe just use this in place of SB in some regular recipes since I am not crazy for the SB sweets.

I think when I mixed that, I was trying to make my 10ml sample of this flavor last because I liked it so much, keep my rewicking to a minimum and costs down. All that is out the window now. I would say this is a great stand alone with potential to receive more popular fruit flavors for the fruit heads that want to dabble. Be warned it’s dark medium blend but it’s really darned good.\n\n**Turkish Oriental (tested at 8%)**\n\n*SM: A perfect dry shag, on its own or mixed with your favorite flavors! Use @ 4-8% \\*NETs are pre-steeped use as any other flavoring\\**\n\nDoggo: yes, dry. Not in a bad way at all but like a pack of cigarettes that has been open for a week and all that raisin smell is gone, it’s just like 3 ciggies left in the pack and they’ve had the room to air out. There’s a hint of spice but it’s really super light compared to say, FLV turkish. It kind of reminds me of a more complex version of some of HS’s drier tobaccos like Ry1 or No5. Also, there’s a sweetness here that isn’t exactly evident at first but it is rather sweet when I focus on it. I kind of like how it’s got that sweet and dry thing going on, but also I’ve been on a crazy kick of ry4’s and sweet cig style vapes. I don’t know, I can’t tell you how authentic this is to an aromatic turkish oriental tobacco, but my tongue is saying this could be used as a less neutral body filler to dry up a bit of another concentrate. Maybe pair it with Sweet Brightleaf and get that spicy woody a little dried up? Like in a 1:2 SBL : TO?\n\n**Black Cavendish (Tested at 10%)**\n\n*SM: Similar to a black and mild, without the really darker notes. At 6% it’s a light version of your grandpa’s pipe. Very smooth, lots of flavor without the burnt taste. At 10% much more bold, with earthy back notes.  Add some dark fire cured for that authentic pipe.*\n\nIsuwasadog: After spending the last 3 weeks on various FLV Cavendish recipes (holy gunking -- like NET level!) not sure what I was expecting here. FLV is really sweet and syrupy pipe for me and this one was advertised as a Black and Mild which is a cigar, yeah? And so I was thinking, I don’t know, cheap cigar. I’m now curious about the 6% (I never knew my Grandpa or that he smoked a pipe) at 10% it’s pretty dark, maybe even a little too dark for me even. It feels kind of one note which is partly why I suspect they added that tip to add dark fired cured for some authenticity. Makes me wonder what DFC does to the mix. I got some SM from nomnomz that is labeled SM Dark Fire and there’s only one [Dark Fire](https://www.stixxmixx.com/product/dark-fire/) no Dark Fire Cured. I think there is a Latakia Dark Fire as well but I’m guessing that’s not it. I think I’m gonna put this on hold and squirt a little bit of Dark fire in there and review it again on the next round. For now, this shows promise, especially if it really does hold the flavor at 6% because that would mean that it’s one of the more cost effective concentrates they have.\n\n**Nicaraguan Seco (tested at 8%)**\n\n*SM: The building block of any great cigar always starts here. Mellow and smooth tobacco taste, with some nutty undertones help put this blend right on top in any cigar or pipe blend you can imagine. Use @ 4-8% \\*NETs are pre-steeped use as any other flavoring\\**\n\nMe: Honestly, I didnt get a whole lot from this one.I tried it and just felt it lacked flavor. Figured that I was suffering from olfactory fatigue and tried it again in the morning the next day. Tried it again later that day. Tried it again the following day. Trying it again right now. I’m getting a reaaaaaaallly soft tobacco flavor, barely noticeable. I get no nutty notes, barely anything. I know that I lean towards bolder flavors in general and this just may be too subtle for my wrecked palate. Possible but I think the 8% cap is low here. I should probably retest at 10% or more, but I’m not feeling it. With all the other ones available that are excellent, I’m going to say this one is a hard pass. Maybe it does something in a mix, as per the SM notes and, since I already have it I may give it a try, but I wouldn’t recommend picking it up for a purchase.\n\n**Canadian Virginian (tested at 10%)**\n\n*SM: Canadian is a light to medium shag, Generally used as a filler or to tie others together. 4-8% and 10% standalone was very throaty after 2 week steep. Lightly earthy. All in all very satisfying.*\n\nMe: I get the filler aspect of this. Low on the sweetness, mostly body, at three weeks didn’t notice some exceptional throat hit. I’d even say barely noticeable to me (but hey I like throat hit). It has that brightness you’d expect from a Virginia but it’s pretty well rooted in some Hobbit leaf Middle Earthy tobacco flavors to round it out a bit.Perhaps I’ve gone a little mad? Maybe not the best stand alone, but I could see this brightening a darker mix slightly or rounding out the mid-range flavors.  \n\n# Conclusion:\n\nWell, I tried to do this all in one sitting so that I could remember all the impressions I had but that Nicaraguan Seco tripped me up and delayed the whole process. So now I’m really left with just impressions and I’m not wildly impressed by these. The surprise flavors were the Sweet Brightleaf which I had tried before and was not really impressed by at the time, and the Honduran Liguero which I had used prior but for some reason had never pushed to its limit. The unusual one for me was the Butter Rum Cavendish. I was expecting something different and it took me a sec to wrap my head around what I was actually getting rather than what was expected. For a more flavorful blend, I’d stick with the Whiskey Cavendish I reviewed in Part I of these notes. But if you want cavendish lite, with some rather unusual notes, I’d say take a chance on this one. I did end up trying Turkish Oriental at near 14% for shits and giggles and not sure it came through much more clearly since I’d switched to an mtl tank, but it held its own.\n\nIn all, I wasn’t as impressed with this bunch as stand alones. Granted these were first impressions, however I think these flavors will require some blending and I look forward to experimenting with them to create blends. I think these are the best uses here and I’ll take that challenge. It’s almost too easy to just get the Supreme, American Virginian, Honduran Liguero, or the Whiskey Cavendish and just have at it as a stand alone. I’d like to see what I can do with this supporting cast and see what vaping 20% of a NET will do to my coils in 2ml. At least, now that I own them.\n\nI think the NET love is still there, but we go in phases. I see this one maybe ending in a while, but next month I have a few others to review so keep your eyes peeled for that. I also just started experimenting with additives to elevate them and make fuller and more well rounded mixes... or you can just go find the recipes by Kopel, Stixx and Bogenshizzle on [elr](https://e-liquid-recipes.com/list?q=stixx+mixx&missing=0&recipesonly=0&adaptedfrom=&sort=recipe.created&direction=asc).\n\nTitle improvement, apex?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nKeep mixin’ kids,\n\n\\- i\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPS Additional Recipe: [Acai Bacco](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/151167) Will need to update this one when I try it again at 10% and see if I can’t round out that berry flavor some more.

Spoiler: I maybe thought that overall those were better flavors. Perhaps that’s because they were my first go round and so I had zero expectations? I don’t know, but these things matter. This time, I tried a small handful of flavors and it still took me forever to review them! Anyway, I usually vape them mtl but for the purposes of the review, all were tested in a c4 dtl for focusing on the flavors. Mtl, they do function a bit differently in my experience and can lose some of the subtlety that makes them rather interesting to vape. All flavors were steeped 3 weeks in 70/30 vg/pg solution for dtl vaping. A reminder that these are NETs (Naturally Extracted Tobaccos) and require frequent rewicking should you choose to take the plunge. Enjoy!\n\n# Flavors\n\n**Butter Rum Cavendish (Tested at 10%)**\n\n*SM: This delicious flavor is expertly blended with Golden Virginia and mellow White Burley. The Cavendish style blend is then topped with a subtle mixture of Buttered New England and Jamaican Rums that produce a bite-free taste.Use @ 6-10% \\*NETs are pre-steeped use as any other flavoring\\**\n\nMe: Definitely smooth all around. It’s not really striking me as overly bacco or booze. It’s definitely modestly both, in a way. Frankly, I’m not sure I’m appreciating the buttery rum flavor as it plays with the bright bacco back finish. I definitely lean more towards bolder tobacco flavors and this one is much much milder than I prefer. The Virginia here does have a bit of sweet which blends into the rum. Had this after a few sips of coffee and wow the butter rum came out. Im positive that this would pair well with coffee and, dare I say ice cream? Maybe not my favorite SM flavor to date, but otherwise an interesting milder flavorful mix and it grew on me asI vaped it. With a few hints or accents I could see this making a unique adv with its lighter flavor and cavendish sweetness on the palate, although I’m not sure what that could be without being overpowering this subtle flavor, maybe some oak accents?\n\n**Sweet Brightleaf (tested at 10%)**\n\n*SM: Exactly that,…a light, bright, loose leaf shag with earthy notes. Layer with other light-medium shags for a nice full bodied taste. Could be used when a light woodsy note is needed. Also use combined with other earthy flavors to create a great tea. Use @ 4-6% – 10% Standalone.* \n\nThe dog: I was expecting something that wouldn’t stand alone from the description of it layering, but it does the shag moniker justice. And it doesn’t strike me as sweet in the way that FLV sweet cigarette does, this has a brightness and for sure a lovely earthy woody note. At first I felt it was ashy, but that was that prominent woody note coming through clearly. Layered in, I don’t see this as a neutral filler at all, and I could easily see this maybe mixing with something a little sweeter to balance out that earthy depth. I’m pretty sure I will eventually add some DNB to this one and vape it solo again. I think the name is a little misleading and I almost expected it to be like those golden nutty rolling tobaccos I used to buy. This one does have the capacity to stand on its own as a bright medium with sweet and complex earthy musky notes and I’m sure could be bent lighter or darker. As I keep vaping this I really do get a different flavors making this a kind of unpredictable surprise and potentially difficult to mix with, luckily it seems have been able to stand alone quite fine.\n\n**Honduran Liguero (tested at 10% - often used in my adv at 5%)**\n\n*SM: A great, smooth shag flavor. Lightly sweet, and very very smooth. Excellent standalone, or with dark berries. Use @ 5-10% \\*NETs are pre-steeped use as any other flavoring\\**\n\nThe dawg: While not my first rodeo with this flavor, I decided to include it in this roundup and test it again at max like I did all the other flavors. I almost dont recognize it as I’ve been vaping it at 4 or 5 % with 1% flv acai for damn near three months. At the low end of 5ish percent, it’s modest and can hang with acai quite nicely. Acai slips in and does its weird bold berry without the funky off notes. I love it and it’s light enough to be a 3 month (literally) dedicated tank so I’m going to go ahead and pre thumb up this one. But, again, at 10, it’s a totally different vape than I’m used to. Great mouthfeel, like really round and full. That must be what they meant by “smooth”, but it really comes across as full for me. While it is flavorful enough at 5, at 10 it delivers. It delivers sweetness that is never overpowering (and often just perfect) and some darker complexity in the smoke. I’ve tried a few darker berries with it at 5 and they overpowered the delicate nuances of the bacco easily so I think this will have to be tried again with Liguero at 10 because I see this shining. I think when I mixed that, I was trying to make my 10ml sample of this flavor last because I liked it so much, keep my rewicking to a minimum and costs down. All that is out the window now. I would say this is a great stand alone with potential to receive more popular fruit flavors for the fruit heads that want to dabble. Be warned it’s dark medium blend but it’s really darned good.\n\n**Turkish Oriental (tested at 8%)**\n\n*SM: A perfect dry shag, on its own or mixed with your favorite flavors! Use @ 4-8% \\*NETs are pre-steeped use as any other flavoring\\**\n\nDoggo: yes, dry. Not in a bad way at all but like a pack of cigarettes that has been open for a week and all that raisin smell is gone, it’s just like 3 ciggies left in the pack and they’ve had the room to air out. There’s a hint of spice but it’s really super light compared to say, FLV turkish. It kind of reminds me of a more complex version of some of HS’s drier tobaccos like Ry1 or No5.

Very smooth, lots of flavor without the burnt taste. At 10% much more bold, with earthy back notes.

    "markdown": "Finally got around to testing some of my SM stuff. I'm the worst at describing a flavor so feel free to trash the notes, disagree or suggest notes to include. I'm mostly publishing them front page because there's so little information on them here so they'd be searchable. I mixed them all up over a month ago and just never got around to testing them due to life priorities. I usually use them in an mtl tank and wasn't blown away by any of them. Tried them all this time in the c4 (adv ss claptons 0.43 at 52W) and there was a huge difference in flavor. I know there's some subtlety lost in mtl vaping but this was remarkable. I think they just deliver better in higher concentrations. Most were tested at the max suggested use and I think that's definitely where you should start if planning to vape solo, test,  or mix right off the bat. These are just my first pass private notes going public. This is not meant to be exhaustive and im not into working too hard so they're just impressions compared to how they were described by the SM website. My hope is that you get more of an idea of which ones to try if you're looking at them at all and willing to deal with the price and rewicking.\n\n**Overall impression**: The flavors are very different from INW or FLV baccos im more familiar with. They are expensive and not cost efficient at all. These are for the tobacco lover who wants a very 'clean' flavored tobacco juice. There was almost no ash in any of them I could really taste but a few gave the 'impression' of ashiness by being bolder or darker. i think all of them could be paired with just about anything since they're so clean, but because they are relatively less aggressive in general, i'd lean towards lighter or less aggressive pairings. Fruits, accents, etc. Also they are all very sweet in general so I can see all of them leaning into an ry2-5 profile with ease.\n\nOn the whole, they lack off notes (and probably on notes too if used too low), unless you consider the natural sweetness an off note. It feels that way sometimes.\n\nRecipes on atf are lacking but there's a bunch on [ELR](https://e-liquid-recipes.com/list?q=Stixx+Mixx).\n\n# Flavors\n\n**SM American Virginian - 12% slightly sweet american styled cigarette.**\n\n*SM: The perfect base note to your tobacco creations. Smooth, Medium to bold American cigarette, full bodied, slightly sweet, red type, Thick mouth feel, (0 to trace) out of (10) throat hit. Use @ 8% Preferred single flavor mix at 10-12%*\n\nI feel this has a medium body and is very sweet. Im guessing 'red type' means marlboro styled? Maybe. What do I know? I disagree about the mouthfeel. It lacks a little body like so many other SM NETs. Sort of plain cigarette flavor with hints of dark fruit like raisin. This could be a good base to mid note for a cigarette. I'd want some more flavor, mixed with something that had some accent notes, maybe a fruit to pair with the sweetness? Definitely want something to fill it out some more.\n\nrelatable flavors: like a sweeter lighter HS ry1?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Havana Primed - 6% Cigar styled aroma**\n\n*SM: A fuller rich cigar, like a big stogie. Very smooth light leaf wrapper with a nice filler.  Stands wonderfully by itself, still the light leaf wrapper but the boldness of the filler comes through. Recommend 2 week steep. Use @ 4-6%*\n\nMe: Sweet cigar stlyed tobacco. Body and a hint of wrapper. I'm not getting any chocolate notes, no coffee notes. I guess my standard is Flv CT shade which is a firggin bully. This is definitely full bodied and smooth at 6%. Not deep either. Not sure i'd vape this as a stand alone. Leaves me wanting more bottom notes to make it more realistic cigar. Something to anchor it down. Maybe add some dnb to make it more realistic?\n\nRecipe: sole atf [https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/47803#vanilla\\_tobacco\\_by\\_sixstrings952](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/47803#vanilla_tobacco_by_sixstrings952)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Whiskey Cavendish - 10% Tobacco Blend with a Whiskey flavoring**\n\n*SM: Whiskey Cavendish is a mixture of Burley, Virginia and Black Cavendish tobaccos with an outstanding whiskey flavoring recipe to achieve a remarkable flavor and aroma – mellow but satisfying. Use @ 8-10%*\n\nMe: finally a complex flavor. I like this one, I can taste the whiskey in it but it's a slightly sweet flavor more than a boozy note. This works as a complex stand alone. There;s lots to this aroma. The bacco blend hits all the points i like. I think this works as a stand alone and shows what can be done with these flavors and the right blend/mix.\n\nRelatable flavors: Much less bold The Southerner. Like a southerner one shot lite.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Aged Burley - 10%**\n\n*SM: A mid to full bodied smoke. When mixed in with a lighter shag, it brings out the manly back notes that you may desire. Earthy, nice throat hit. Use @ 6-10%*\n\nMe: great smell off this one before i even tried it. Slight nutty taste and only a hint of sweet. I like the body on this one, full and low. It could stand as the main note in a mix. Definitely not kidding about the throat hit. It feels like just the right mid-base note, but not as in your face as the FLV version. perhaps they are right about the 'manly back notes' (is that hairiness?). I'd maybe pair this with sweet brightleaf? If you are used to Flv Red Burley, this is a much more mellow nuttiness yet also an as distinct flavor. If you are tired of flv RB then I'd get this one.\n\nRelatable flavors: Much less bold Flv Red burley.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Brazilian Viso - 10%**\n\n*SM: A nice dry, not sweet shag. In the medium range it can provide body to many a mix. Use as a filler with some Nicaraguan Seco or Burley. Steep minimum of 2 weeks for full flavor. Use @ 6-8% standalone @ 10%*\n\nMe: Noticeably less sweet than the rest. Maybe not necessarily in a good way but I could see this being added to one of the sweeter ones to bring it down a notch. Has a nice woody flavor that is very different from the rest. rather enjoyable on it's own and I could see this being the 'cured for body' fix for the NET range at 4-6%. At 10% it doesnt seem to hold up to the complexity of the WC or HP. Not sure how much filler burley needs. I'd like to pair it with something that will play well with the woody notes. American Virginian or the Burley perhaps?\n\nRelatable flavors: Hints of woody like Vanilla for pipe but without the vanilla/pipe-y muskiness. And not as strong; just a hint. Definitely more of a cig type.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Supreme - 6% Tobacco Blend**\n\nSM: *A nice combination of three different shags….Nicaraguan Ligero Filler,Connecticut Broadleaf Binder,and Havana Wrapper. For a bold and smooth taste! Use @ 6-10%*\n\nMe: Tried this at the lower end for once. Big Mistake, meaning I just want more. Surprisingly the flavor is there but im not picking up the flavor like the other samples and i regret it because this has a very good flavor as a stand alone. This one is complex enough to be vaped solo. Only a hint of sweet, the combination flavor here is working to make a nice well rounded tobacco. At 6, it’s not failing to deliver the flavor, I just can’t get behind it this low, despite it being dark and rich.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Wild strawberry Tea - 8% Green tea w/SB**\n\nSM: Japanese Sencha green tea with a refreshing strawberry and papaya. Recommended at 4-8%\n\nMe: at 8% this delivers a powerful SB flavor. Slightly floral with a decent throat hit, it’s sweet with a little bit of green from the tea, a nice match. Not a green like a stem from a strawberry, but just adding to the fullness of the flavor. It’s a nice complement. Not sure im picking up on the papaya at all. Sweet almost powdery sugar. I might add some SB flavoring to this to round it out a bit if i wanted a fuller SB but it works here solo. The tea is not very pronounced and low in the background as that slight green, not astringent, just a hint. I dont think I would mess with this too much. Maybe just something to boost the tea notes or fill out the berry? Maybe just use this in place of SB in some regular recipes since I am not crazy for the SB sweets. Definitely worth the test.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion**: The Supreme or Whiskey Cavendish if you want an all-in-one flavor good to go. Overall, not nearly as good in mtl imo; the subtlety that makes them so smooth and fun to vape is lost. Not really cost effective but for the tobacco lovers, they are worth a try and really interesting to vape. I find that when I switch back over to the flv/inw mixes i have, I feel they are clumsy and overbearing at first by comparison to the SM flavors. As a general statement, they were all pretty sweet so if that's a problem, go Brazilian Viso for sure for a less sweet cig style. The tea was an interesting vape more for the SB flavor (which isn't really my passion) and seemed so forward compared to any combination of SB i've ever had. Thanks for reading, hope this helps!",

Spoiler: I maybe thought that overall those were better flavors. Perhaps that’s because they were my first go round and so I had zero expectations? I don’t know, but these things matter. This time, I tried a small handful of flavors and it still took me forever to review them! Anyway, I usually vape them mtl but for the purposes of the review, all were tested in a c4 dtl for focusing on the flavors. Mtl, they do function a bit differently in my experience and can lose some of the subtlety that makes them rather interesting to vape. All flavors were steeped 3 weeks in 70/30 vg/pg solution for dtl vaping. A reminder that these are NETs (Naturally Extracted Tobaccos) and require frequent rewicking should you choose to take the plunge. Enjoy!\n\n# Flavors\n\n**Butter Rum Cavendish (Tested at 10%)**\n\n*SM: This delicious flavor is expertly blended with Golden Virginia and mellow White Burley. The Cavendish style blend is then topped with a subtle mixture of Buttered New England and Jamaican Rums that produce a bite-free taste.Use @ 6-10% \\*NETs are pre-steeped use as any other flavoring\\**\n\nMe: Definitely smooth all around. It’s not really striking me as overly bacco or booze. It’s definitely modestly both, in a way. Frankly, I’m not sure I’m appreciating the buttery rum flavor as it plays with the bright bacco back finish. I definitely lean more towards bolder tobacco flavors and this one is much much milder than I prefer. The Virginia here does have a bit of sweet which blends into the rum. Had this after a few sips of coffee and wow the butter rum came out. Im positive that this would pair well with coffee and, dare I say ice cream? Maybe not my favorite SM flavor to date, but otherwise an interesting milder flavorful mix and it grew on me asI vaped it. With a few hints or accents I could see this making a unique adv with its lighter flavor and cavendish sweetness on the palate, although I’m not sure what that could be without being overpowering this subtle flavor, maybe some oak accents?\n\n**Sweet Brightleaf (tested at 10%)**\n\n*SM: Exactly that,…a light, bright, loose leaf shag with earthy notes. Layer with other light-medium shags for a nice full bodied taste. Could be used when a light woodsy note is needed. Also use combined with other earthy flavors to create a great tea. Use @ 4-6% – 10% Standalone.* \n\nThe dog: I was expecting something that wouldn’t stand alone from the description of it layering, but it does the shag moniker justice. And it doesn’t strike me as sweet in the way that FLV sweet cigarette does, this has a brightness and for sure a lovely earthy woody note. At first I felt it was ashy, but that was that prominent woody note coming through clearly. Layered in, I don’t see this as a neutral filler at all, and I could easily see this maybe mixing with something a little sweeter to balance out that earthy depth. I’m pretty sure I will eventually add some DNB to this one and vape it solo again. I think the name is a little misleading and I almost expected it to be like those golden nutty rolling tobaccos I used to buy. This one does have the capacity to stand on its own as a bright medium with sweet and complex earthy musky notes and I’m sure could be bent lighter or darker. As I keep vaping this I really do get a different flavors making this a kind of unpredictable surprise and potentially difficult to mix with, luckily it seems have been able to stand alone quite fine.\n\n**Honduran Liguero (tested at 10% - often used in my adv at 5%)**\n\n*SM: A great, smooth shag flavor. Lightly sweet, and very very smooth. Excellent standalone, or with dark berries. Use @ 5-10% \\*NETs are pre-steeped use as any other flavoring\\**\n\nThe dawg: While not my first rodeo with this flavor, I decided to include it in this roundup and test it again at max like I did all the other flavors. I almost dont recognize it as I’ve been vaping it at 4 or 5 % with 1% flv acai for damn near three months. At the low end of 5ish percent, it’s modest and can hang with acai quite nicely. Acai slips in and does its weird bold berry without the funky off notes. I love it and it’s light enough to be a 3 month (literally) dedicated tank so I’m going to go ahead and pre thumb up this one. But, again, at 10, it’s a totally different vape than I’m used to. Great mouthfeel, like really round and full. That must be what they meant by “smooth”, but it really comes across as full for me. While it is flavorful enough at 5, at 10 it delivers. It delivers sweetness that is never overpowering (and often just perfect) and some darker complexity in the smoke. I’ve tried a few darker berries with it at 5 and they overpowered the delicate nuances of the bacco easily so I think this will have to be tried again with Liguero at 10 because I see this shining. I think when I mixed that, I was trying to make my 10ml sample of this flavor last because I liked it so much, keep my rewicking to a minimum and costs down. All that is out the window now. I would say this is a great stand alone with potential to receive more popular fruit flavors for the fruit heads that want to dabble. Be warned it’s dark medium blend but it’s really darned good.\n\n**Turkish Oriental (tested at 8%)**\n\n*SM: A perfect dry shag, on its own or mixed with your favorite flavors! Use @ 4-8% \\*NETs are pre-steeped use as any other flavoring\\**\n\nDoggo: yes, dry. Not in a bad way at all but like a pack of cigarettes that has been open for a week and all that raisin smell is gone, it’s just like 3 ciggies left in the pack and they’ve had the room to air out. There’s a hint of spice but it’s really super light compared to say, FLV turkish. It kind of reminds me of a more complex version of some of HS’s drier tobaccos like Ry1 or No5. Also, there’s a sweetness here that isn’t exactly evident at first but it is rather sweet when I focus on it. I kind of like how it’s got that sweet and dry thing going on, but also I’ve been on a crazy kick of ry4’s and sweet cig style vapes. I don’t know, I can’t tell you how authentic this is to an aromatic turkish oriental tobacco, but my tongue is saying this could be used as a less neutral body filler to dry up a bit of another concentrate. Maybe pair it with Sweet Brightleaf and get that spicy woody a little dried up? Like in a 1:2 SBL : TO?\n\n**Black Cavendish (Tested at 10%)**\n\n*SM: Similar to a black and mild, without the really darker notes. At 6% it’s a light version of your grandpa’s pipe. Very smooth, lots of flavor without the burnt taste. At 10% much more bold, with earthy back notes.  Add some dark fire cured for that authentic pipe.*\n\nIsuwasadog: After spending the last 3 weeks on various FLV Cavendish recipes (holy gunking -- like NET level!) not sure what I was expecting here. FLV is really sweet and syrupy pipe for me and this one was advertised as a Black and Mild which is a cigar, yeah? And so I was thinking, I don’t know, cheap cigar. I’m now curious about the 6% (I never knew my Grandpa or that he smoked a pipe) at 10% it’s pretty dark, maybe even a little too dark for me even. It feels kind of one note which is partly why I suspect they added that tip to add dark fired cured for some authenticity. Makes me wonder what DFC does to the mix. I got some SM from nomnomz that is labeled SM Dark Fire and there’s only one [Dark Fire](https://www.stixxmixx.com/product/dark-fire/) no Dark Fire Cured. I think there is a Latakia Dark Fire as well but I’m guessing that’s not it. I think I’m gonna put this on hold and squirt a little bit of Dark fire in there and review it again on the next round. For now, this shows promise, especially if it really does hold the flavor at 6% because that would mean that it’s one of the more cost effective concentrates they have.\n\n**Nicaraguan Seco (tested at 8%)**\n\n*SM: The building block of any great cigar always starts here. Mellow and smooth tobacco taste, with some nutty undertones help put this blend right on top in any cigar or pipe blend you can imagine. Use @ 4-8% \\*NETs are pre-steeped use as any other flavoring\\**\n\nMe: Honestly, I didnt get a whole lot from this one.I tried it and just felt it lacked flavor. Figured that I was suffering from olfactory fatigue and tried it again in the morning the next day. Tried it again later that day. Tried it again the following day. Trying it again right now. I’m getting a reaaaaaaallly soft tobacco flavor, barely noticeable. I get no nutty notes, barely anything. I know that I lean towards bolder flavors in general and this just may be too subtle for my wrecked palate. Possible but I think the 8% cap is low here. I should probably retest at 10% or more, but I’m not feeling it. With all the other ones available that are excellent, I’m going to say this one is a hard pass. Maybe it does something in a mix, as per the SM notes and, since I already have it I may give it a try, but I wouldn’t recommend picking it up for a purchase.\n\n**Canadian Virginian (tested at 10%)**\n\n*SM: Canadian is a light to medium shag, Generally used as a filler or to tie others together. 4-8% and 10% standalone was very throaty after 2 week steep. Lightly earthy. All in all very satisfying.*\n\nMe: I get the filler aspect of this. Low on the sweetness, mostly body, at three weeks didn’t notice some exceptional throat hit. I’d even say barely noticeable to me (but hey I like throat hit). It has that brightness you’d expect from a Virginia but it’s pretty well rooted in some Hobbit leaf Middle Earthy tobacco flavors to round it out a bit.Perhaps I’ve gone a little mad? Maybe not the best stand alone, but I could see this brightening a darker mix slightly or rounding out the mid-range flavors.  \n\n# Conclusion:\n\nWell, I tried to do this all in one sitting so that I could remember all the impressions I had but that Nicaraguan Seco tripped me up and delayed the whole process. So now I’m really left with just impressions and I’m not wildly impressed by these. The surprise flavors were the Sweet Brightleaf which I had tried before and was not really impressed by at the time, and the Honduran Liguero which I had used prior but for some reason had never pushed to its limit. The unusual one for me was the Butter Rum Cavendish. I was expecting something different and it took me a sec to wrap my head around what I was actually getting rather than what was expected. For a more flavorful blend, I’d stick with the Whiskey Cavendish I reviewed in Part I of these notes. But if you want cavendish lite, with some rather unusual notes, I’d say take a chance on this one. I did end up trying Turkish Oriental at near 14% for shits and giggles and not sure it came through much more clearly since I’d switched to an mtl tank, but it held its own.\n\nIn all, I wasn’t as impressed with this bunch as stand alones. Granted these were first impressions, however I think these flavors will require some blending and I look forward to experimenting with them to create blends. I think these are the best uses here and I’ll take that challenge. It’s almost too easy to just get the Supreme, American Virginian, Honduran Liguero, or the Whiskey Cavendish and just have at it as a stand alone. I’d like to see what I can do with this supporting cast and see what vaping 20% of a NET will do to my coils in 2ml. At least, now that I own them.\n\nI think the NET love is still there, but we go in phases. I see this one maybe ending in a while, but next month I have a few others to review so keep your eyes peeled for that. I also just started experimenting with additives to elevate them and make fuller and more well rounded mixes... or you can just go find the recipes by Kopel, Stixx and Bogenshizzle on [elr](https://e-liquid-recipes.com/list?q=stixx+mixx&missing=0&recipesonly=0&adaptedfrom=&sort=recipe.created&direction=asc).\n\nTitle improvement, apex?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nKeep mixin’ kids,\n\n\\- i\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPS Additional Recipe: [Acai Bacco](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/151167) Will need to update this one when I try it again at 10% and see if I can’t round out that berry flavor some more.

I would say this is a great stand alone with potential to receive more popular fruit flavors for the fruit heads that want to dabble. Be warned it’s dark medium blend but it’s really darned good.\n\n**Turkish Oriental (tested at 8%)**\n\n*SM: A perfect dry shag, on its own or mixed with your favorite flavors! Use @ 4-8% \\*NETs are pre-steeped use as any other flavoring\\**\n\nDoggo: yes, dry. Not in a bad way at all but like a pack of cigarettes that has been open for a week and all that raisin smell is gone, it’s just like 3 ciggies left in the pack and they’ve had the room to air out. There’s a hint of spice but it’s really super light compared to say, FLV turkish. It kind of reminds me of a more complex version of some of HS’s drier tobaccos like Ry1 or No5. Also, there’s a sweetness here that isn’t exactly evident at first but it is rather sweet when I focus on it. I kind of like how it’s got that sweet and dry thing going on, but also I’ve been on a crazy kick of ry4’s and sweet cig style vapes. I don’t know, I can’t tell you how authentic this is to an aromatic turkish oriental tobacco, but my tongue is saying this could be used as a less neutral body filler to dry up a bit of another concentrate. Maybe pair it with Sweet Brightleaf and get that spicy woody a little dried up? Like in a 1:2 SBL : TO?\n\n**Black Cavendish (Tested at 10%)**\n\n*SM: Similar to a black and mild, without the really darker notes. At 6% it’s a light version of your grandpa’s pipe. Very smooth, lots of flavor without the burnt taste. At 10% much more bold, with earthy back notes.  Add some dark fire cured for that authentic pipe.*\n\nIsuwasadog: After spending the last 3 weeks on various FLV Cavendish recipes (holy gunking -- like NET level!) not sure what I was expecting here. FLV is really sweet and syrupy pipe for me and this one was advertised as a Black and Mild which is a cigar, yeah? And so I was thinking, I don’t know, cheap cigar. I’m now curious about the 6% (I never knew my Grandpa or that he smoked a pipe) at 10% it’s pretty dark, maybe even a little too dark for me even. It feels kind of one note which is partly why I suspect they added that tip to add dark fired cured for some authenticity. Makes me wonder what DFC does to the mix. I got some SM from nomnomz that is labeled SM Dark Fire and there’s only one [Dark Fire](https://www.stixxmixx.com/product/dark-fire/) no Dark Fire Cured. I think there is a Latakia Dark Fire as well but I’m guessing that’s not it. I think I’m gonna put this on hold and squirt a little bit of Dark fire in there and review it again on the next round. For now, this shows promise, especially if it really does hold the flavor at 6% because that would mean that it’s one of the more cost effective concentrates they have.\n\n**Nicaraguan Seco (tested at 8%)**\n\n*SM: The building block of any great cigar always starts here. Mellow and smooth tobacco taste, with some nutty undertones help put this blend right on top in any cigar or pipe blend you can imagine. Use @ 4-8% \\*NETs are pre-steeped use as any other flavoring\\**\n\nMe: Honestly, I didnt get a whole lot from this one.I tried it and just felt it lacked flavor. Figured that I was suffering from olfactory fatigue and tried it again in the morning the next day. Tried it again later that day. Tried it again the following day. Trying it again right now. I’m getting a reaaaaaaallly soft tobacco flavor, barely noticeable. I get no nutty notes, barely anything. I know that I lean towards bolder flavors in general and this just may be too subtle for my wrecked palate. Possible but I think the 8% cap is low here. I should probably retest at 10% or more, but I’m not feeling it. With all the other ones available that are excellent, I’m going to say this one is a hard pass. Maybe it does something in a mix, as per the SM notes and, since I already have it I may give it a try, but I wouldn’t recommend picking it up for a purchase.\n\n**Canadian Virginian (tested at 10%)**\n\n*SM: Canadian is a light to medium shag, Generally used as a filler or to tie others together. 4-8% and 10% standalone was very throaty after 2 week steep. Lightly earthy. All in all very satisfying.*\n\nMe: I get the filler aspect of this. Low on the sweetness, mostly body, at three weeks didn’t notice some exceptional throat hit. I’d even say barely noticeable to me (but hey I like throat hit). It has that brightness you’d expect from a Virginia but it’s pretty well rooted in some Hobbit leaf Middle Earthy tobacco flavors to round it out a bit.Perhaps I’ve gone a little mad? Maybe not the best stand alone, but I could see this brightening a darker mix slightly or rounding out the mid-range flavors.  \n\n# Conclusion:\n\nWell, I tried to do this all in one sitting so that I could remember all the impressions I had but that Nicaraguan Seco tripped me up and delayed the whole process. So now I’m really left with just impressions and I’m not wildly impressed by these. The surprise flavors were the Sweet Brightleaf which I had tried before and was not really impressed by at the time, and the Honduran Liguero which I had used prior but for some reason had never pushed to its limit. The unusual one for me was the Butter Rum Cavendish. I was expecting something different and it took me a sec to wrap my head around what I was actually getting rather than what was expected. For a more flavorful blend, I’d stick with the Whiskey Cavendish I reviewed in Part I of these notes. But if you want cavendish lite, with some rather unusual notes, I’d say take a chance on this one. I did end up trying Turkish Oriental at near 14% for shits and giggles and not sure it came through much more clearly since I’d switched to an mtl tank, but it held its own.\n\nIn all, I wasn’t as impressed with this bunch as stand alones. Granted these were first impressions, however I think these flavors will require some blending and I look forward to experimenting with them to create blends. I think these are the best uses here and I’ll take that challenge. It’s almost too easy to just get the Supreme, American Virginian, Honduran Liguero, or the Whiskey Cavendish and just have at it as a stand alone. I’d like to see what I can do with this supporting cast and see what vaping 20% of a NET will do to my coils in 2ml. At least, now that I own them.\n\nI think the NET love is still there, but we go in phases. I see this one maybe ending in a while, but next month I have a few others to review so keep your eyes peeled for that. I also just started experimenting with additives to elevate them and make fuller and more well rounded mixes... or you can just go find the recipes by Kopel, Stixx and Bogenshizzle on [elr](https://e-liquid-recipes.com/list?q=stixx+mixx&missing=0&recipesonly=0&adaptedfrom=&sort=recipe.created&direction=asc).\n\nTitle improvement, apex?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nKeep mixin’ kids,\n\n\\- i\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPS Additional Recipe: [Acai Bacco](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/151167) Will need to update this one when I try it again at 10% and see if I can’t round out that berry flavor some more.

    "markdown": "Finally got around to testing some of my SM stuff. I'm the worst at describing a flavor so feel free to trash the notes, disagree or suggest notes to include. I'm mostly publishing them front page because there's so little information on them here so they'd be searchable. I mixed them all up over a month ago and just never got around to testing them due to life priorities. I usually use them in an mtl tank and wasn't blown away by any of them. Tried them all this time in the c4 (adv ss claptons 0.43 at 52W) and there was a huge difference in flavor. I know there's some subtlety lost in mtl vaping but this was remarkable. I think they just deliver better in higher concentrations. Most were tested at the max suggested use and I think that's definitely where you should start if planning to vape solo, test,  or mix right off the bat. These are just my first pass private notes going public. This is not meant to be exhaustive and im not into working too hard so they're just impressions compared to how they were described by the SM website. My hope is that you get more of an idea of which ones to try if you're looking at them at all and willing to deal with the price and rewicking.\n\n**Overall impression**: The flavors are very different from INW or FLV baccos im more familiar with. They are expensive and not cost efficient at all. These are for the tobacco lover who wants a very 'clean' flavored tobacco juice. There was almost no ash in any of them I could really taste but a few gave the 'impression' of ashiness by being bolder or darker. i think all of them could be paired with just about anything since they're so clean, but because they are relatively less aggressive in general, i'd lean towards lighter or less aggressive pairings. Fruits, accents, etc. Also they are all very sweet in general so I can see all of them leaning into an ry2-5 profile with ease.\n\nOn the whole, they lack off notes (and probably on notes too if used too low), unless you consider the natural sweetness an off note. It feels that way sometimes.\n\nRecipes on atf are lacking but there's a bunch on [ELR](https://e-liquid-recipes.com/list?q=Stixx+Mixx).\n\n# Flavors\n\n**SM American Virginian - 12% slightly sweet american styled cigarette.**\n\n*SM: The perfect base note to your tobacco creations. Smooth, Medium to bold American cigarette, full bodied, slightly sweet, red type, Thick mouth feel, (0 to trace) out of (10) throat hit. Use @ 8% Preferred single flavor mix at 10-12%*\n\nI feel this has a medium body and is very sweet. Im guessing 'red type' means marlboro styled? Maybe. What do I know? I disagree about the mouthfeel. It lacks a little body like so many other SM NETs. Sort of plain cigarette flavor with hints of dark fruit like raisin. This could be a good base to mid note for a cigarette. I'd want some more flavor, mixed with something that had some accent notes, maybe a fruit to pair with the sweetness? Definitely want something to fill it out some more.\n\nrelatable flavors: like a sweeter lighter HS ry1?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Havana Primed - 6% Cigar styled aroma**\n\n*SM: A fuller rich cigar, like a big stogie. Very smooth light leaf wrapper with a nice filler.  Stands wonderfully by itself, still the light leaf wrapper but the boldness of the filler comes through. Recommend 2 week steep. Use @ 4-6%*\n\nMe: Sweet cigar stlyed tobacco. Body and a hint of wrapper. I'm not getting any chocolate notes, no coffee notes. I guess my standard is Flv CT shade which is a firggin bully. This is definitely full bodied and smooth at 6%. Not deep either. Not sure i'd vape this as a stand alone. Leaves me wanting more bottom notes to make it more realistic cigar. Something to anchor it down. Maybe add some dnb to make it more realistic?\n\nRecipe: sole atf [https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/47803#vanilla\\_tobacco\\_by\\_sixstrings952](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/47803#vanilla_tobacco_by_sixstrings952)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Whiskey Cavendish - 10% Tobacco Blend with a Whiskey flavoring**\n\n*SM: Whiskey Cavendish is a mixture of Burley, Virginia and Black Cavendish tobaccos with an outstanding whiskey flavoring recipe to achieve a remarkable flavor and aroma – mellow but satisfying. Use @ 8-10%*\n\nMe: finally a complex flavor. I like this one, I can taste the whiskey in it but it's a slightly sweet flavor more than a boozy note. This works as a complex stand alone. There;s lots to this aroma. The bacco blend hits all the points i like. I think this works as a stand alone and shows what can be done with these flavors and the right blend/mix.\n\nRelatable flavors: Much less bold The Southerner. Like a southerner one shot lite.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Aged Burley - 10%**\n\n*SM: A mid to full bodied smoke. When mixed in with a lighter shag, it brings out the manly back notes that you may desire. Earthy, nice throat hit. Use @ 6-10%*\n\nMe: great smell off this one before i even tried it. Slight nutty taste and only a hint of sweet. I like the body on this one, full and low. It could stand as the main note in a mix. Definitely not kidding about the throat hit. It feels like just the right mid-base note, but not as in your face as the FLV version. perhaps they are right about the 'manly back notes' (is that hairiness?). I'd maybe pair this with sweet brightleaf? If you are used to Flv Red Burley, this is a much more mellow nuttiness yet also an as distinct flavor. If you are tired of flv RB then I'd get this one.\n\nRelatable flavors: Much less bold Flv Red burley.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Brazilian Viso - 10%**\n\n*SM: A nice dry, not sweet shag. In the medium range it can provide body to many a mix. Use as a filler with some Nicaraguan Seco or Burley. Steep minimum of 2 weeks for full flavor. Use @ 6-8% standalone @ 10%*\n\nMe: Noticeably less sweet than the rest. Maybe not necessarily in a good way but I could see this being added to one of the sweeter ones to bring it down a notch. Has a nice woody flavor that is very different from the rest. rather enjoyable on it's own and I could see this being the 'cured for body' fix for the NET range at 4-6%. At 10% it doesnt seem to hold up to the complexity of the WC or HP. Not sure how much filler burley needs. I'd like to pair it with something that will play well with the woody notes. American Virginian or the Burley perhaps?\n\nRelatable flavors: Hints of woody like Vanilla for pipe but without the vanilla/pipe-y muskiness. And not as strong; just a hint. Definitely more of a cig type.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Supreme - 6% Tobacco Blend**\n\nSM: *A nice combination of three different shags….Nicaraguan Ligero Filler,Connecticut Broadleaf Binder,and Havana Wrapper. For a bold and smooth taste! Use @ 6-10%*\n\nMe: Tried this at the lower end for once. Big Mistake, meaning I just want more. Surprisingly the flavor is there but im not picking up the flavor like the other samples and i regret it because this has a very good flavor as a stand alone. This one is complex enough to be vaped solo. Only a hint of sweet, the combination flavor here is working to make a nice well rounded tobacco. At 6, it’s not failing to deliver the flavor, I just can’t get behind it this low, despite it being dark and rich.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Wild strawberry Tea - 8% Green tea w/SB**\n\nSM: Japanese Sencha green tea with a refreshing strawberry and papaya. Recommended at 4-8%\n\nMe: at 8% this delivers a powerful SB flavor. Slightly floral with a decent throat hit, it’s sweet with a little bit of green from the tea, a nice match. Not a green like a stem from a strawberry, but just adding to the fullness of the flavor. It’s a nice complement. Not sure im picking up on the papaya at all. Sweet almost powdery sugar. I might add some SB flavoring to this to round it out a bit if i wanted a fuller SB but it works here solo. The tea is not very pronounced and low in the background as that slight green, not astringent, just a hint. I dont think I would mess with this too much. Maybe just something to boost the tea notes or fill out the berry? Maybe just use this in place of SB in some regular recipes since I am not crazy for the SB sweets. Definitely worth the test.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion**: The Supreme or Whiskey Cavendish if you want an all-in-one flavor good to go. Overall, not nearly as good in mtl imo; the subtlety that makes them so smooth and fun to vape is lost. Not really cost effective but for the tobacco lovers, they are worth a try and really interesting to vape. I find that when I switch back over to the flv/inw mixes i have, I feel they are clumsy and overbearing at first by comparison to the SM flavors. As a general statement, they were all pretty sweet so if that's a problem, go Brazilian Viso for sure for a less sweet cig style. The tea was an interesting vape more for the SB flavor (which isn't really my passion) and seemed so forward compared to any combination of SB i've ever had. Thanks for reading, hope this helps!",

    "markdown": "#  Introduction\n\nPlease see [Part I: Stixx Mixx First Impressions](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/ci2je7/stixx_mixx_first_impressions_part_i_a_low_effort/) for more flavor reviews. Spoiler: I maybe thought that overall those were better flavors. Perhaps that’s because they were my first go round and so I had zero expectations? I don’t know, but these things matter. This time, I tried a small handful of flavors and it still took me forever to review them! Anyway, I usually vape them mtl but for the purposes of the review, all were tested in a c4 dtl for focusing on the flavors. Mtl, they do function a bit differently in my experience and can lose some of the subtlety that makes them rather interesting to vape. All flavors were steeped 3 weeks in 70/30 vg/pg solution for dtl vaping. A reminder that these are NETs (Naturally Extracted Tobaccos) and require frequent rewicking should you choose to take the plunge. Enjoy!\n\n# Flavors\n\n**Butter Rum Cavendish (Tested at 10%)**\n\n*SM: This delicious flavor is expertly blended with Golden Virginia and mellow White Burley. The Cavendish style blend is then topped with a subtle mixture of Buttered New England and Jamaican Rums that produce a bite-free taste.Use @ 6-10% \\*NETs are pre-steeped use as any other flavoring\\**\n\nMe: Definitely smooth all around. It’s not really striking me as overly bacco or booze. It’s definitely modestly both, in a way. Frankly, I’m not sure I’m appreciating the buttery rum flavor as it plays with the bright bacco back finish. I definitely lean more towards bolder tobacco flavors and this one is much much milder than I prefer. The Virginia here does have a bit of sweet which blends into the rum. Had this after a few sips of coffee and wow the butter rum came out. Im positive that this would pair well with coffee and, dare I say ice cream? Maybe not my favorite SM flavor to date, but otherwise an interesting milder flavorful mix and it grew on me asI vaped it. With a few hints or accents I could see this making a unique adv with its lighter flavor and cavendish sweetness on the palate, although I’m not sure what that could be without being overpowering this subtle flavor, maybe some oak accents?\n\n**Sweet Brightleaf (tested at 10%)**\n\n*SM: Exactly that,…a light, bright, loose leaf shag with earthy notes. Layer with other light-medium shags for a nice full bodied taste. Could be used when a light woodsy note is needed. Also use combined with other earthy flavors to create a great tea. Use @ 4-6% – 10% Standalone.* \n\nThe dog: I was expecting something that wouldn’t stand alone from the description of it layering, but it does the shag moniker justice. And it doesn’t strike me as sweet in the way that FLV sweet cigarette does, this has a brightness and for sure a lovely earthy woody note. At first I felt it was ashy, but that was that prominent woody note coming through clearly. Layered in, I don’t see this as a neutral filler at all, and I could easily see this maybe mixing with something a little sweeter to balance out that earthy depth. I’m pretty sure I will eventually add some DNB to this one and vape it solo again. I think the name is a little misleading and I almost expected it to be like those golden nutty rolling tobaccos I used to buy. This one does have the capacity to stand on its own as a bright medium with sweet and complex earthy musky notes and I’m sure could be bent lighter or darker. As I keep vaping this I really do get a different flavors making this a kind of unpredictable surprise and potentially difficult to mix with, luckily it seems have been able to stand alone quite fine.\n\n**Honduran Liguero (tested at 10% - often used in my adv at 5%)**\n\n*SM: A great, smooth shag flavor. Lightly sweet, and very very smooth. Excellent standalone, or with dark berries. Use @ 5-10% \\*NETs are pre-steeped use as any other flavoring\\**\n\nThe dawg: While not my first rodeo with this flavor, I decided to include it in this roundup and test it again at max like I did all the other flavors. I almost dont recognize it as I’ve been vaping it at 4 or 5 % with 1% flv acai for damn near three months. At the low end of 5ish percent, it’s modest and can hang with acai quite nicely. Acai slips in and does its weird bold berry without the funky off notes. I love it and it’s light enough to be a 3 month (literally) dedicated tank so I’m going to go ahead and pre thumb up this one. But, again, at 10, it’s a totally different vape than I’m used to. Great mouthfeel, like really round and full. That must be what they meant by “smooth”, but it really comes across as full for me. While it is flavorful enough at 5, at 10 it delivers. It delivers sweetness that is never overpowering (and often just perfect) and some darker complexity in the smoke. I’ve tried a few darker berries with it at 5 and they overpowered the delicate nuances of the bacco easily so I think this will have to be tried again with Liguero at 10 because I see this shining. I think when I mixed that, I was trying to make my 10ml sample of this flavor last because I liked it so much, keep my rewicking to a minimum and costs down. All that is out the window now. I would say this is a great stand alone with potential to receive more popular fruit flavors for the fruit heads that want to dabble. Be warned it’s dark medium blend but it’s really darned good.\n\n**Turkish Oriental (tested at 8%)**\n\n*SM: A perfect dry shag, on its own or mixed with your favorite flavors! Use @ 4-8% \\*NETs are pre-steeped use as any other flavoring\\**\n\nDoggo: yes, dry. Not in a bad way at all but like a pack of cigarettes that has been open for a week and all that raisin smell is gone, it’s just like 3 ciggies left in the pack and they’ve had the room to air out. There’s a hint of spice but it’s really super light compared to say, FLV turkish. It kind of reminds me of a more complex version of some of HS’s drier tobaccos like Ry1 or No5.

Very smooth, lots of flavor without the burnt taste. At 10% much more bold, with earthy back notes.  Add some dark fire cured for that authentic pipe.*\n\nIsuwasadog: After spending the last 3 weeks on various FLV Cavendish recipes (holy gunking -- like NET level!) not sure what I was expecting here.

Tried them all this time in the c4 (adv ss claptons 0.43 at 52W) and there was a huge difference in flavor. I know there's some subtlety lost in mtl vaping but this was remarkable. I think they just deliver better in higher concentrations. Most were tested at the max suggested use and I think that's definitely where you should start if planning to vape solo, test,  or mix right off the bat. These are just my first pass private notes going public. This is not meant to be exhaustive and im not into working too hard so they're just impressions compared to how they were described by the SM website. My hope is that you get more of an idea of which ones to try if you're looking at them at all and willing to deal with the price and rewicking.\n\n**Overall impression**: The flavors are very different from INW or FLV baccos im more familiar with. They are expensive and not cost efficient at all. These are for the tobacco lover who wants a very 'clean' flavored tobacco juice. There was almost no ash in any of them I could really taste but a few gave the 'impression' of ashiness by being bolder or darker. i think all of them could be paired with just about anything since they're so clean, but because they are relatively less aggressive in general, i'd lean towards lighter or less aggressive pairings. Fruits, accents, etc. Also they are all very sweet in general so I can see all of them leaning into an ry2-5 profile with ease.\n\nOn the whole, they lack off notes (and probably on notes too if used too low), unless you consider the natural sweetness an off note. It feels that way sometimes.\n\nRecipes on atf are lacking but there's a bunch on [ELR](https://e-liquid-recipes.com/list?q=Stixx+Mixx).\n\n# Flavors\n\n**SM American Virginian - 12% slightly sweet american styled cigarette.**\n\n*SM: The perfect base note to your tobacco creations. Smooth, Medium to bold American cigarette, full bodied, slightly sweet, red type, Thick mouth feel, (0 to trace) out of (10) throat hit. Use @ 8% Preferred single flavor mix at 10-12%*\n\nI feel this has a medium body and is very sweet. Im guessing 'red type' means marlboro styled? Maybe. What do I know? I disagree about the mouthfeel. It lacks a little body like so many other SM NETs. Sort of plain cigarette flavor with hints of dark fruit like raisin. This could be a good base to mid note for a cigarette. I'd want some more flavor, mixed with something that had some accent notes, maybe a fruit to pair with the sweetness? Definitely want something to fill it out some more.\n\nrelatable flavors: like a sweeter lighter HS ry1?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Havana Primed - 6% Cigar styled aroma**\n\n*SM: A fuller rich cigar, like a big stogie. Very smooth light leaf wrapper with a nice filler.  Stands wonderfully by itself, still the light leaf wrapper but the boldness of the filler comes through. Recommend 2 week steep. Use @ 4-6%*\n\nMe: Sweet cigar stlyed tobacco. Body and a hint of wrapper. I'm not getting any chocolate notes, no coffee notes. I guess my standard is Flv CT shade which is a firggin bully. This is definitely full bodied and smooth at 6%. Not deep either. Not sure i'd vape this as a stand alone. Leaves me wanting more bottom notes to make it more realistic cigar. Something to anchor it down. Maybe add some dnb to make it more realistic?\n\nRecipe: sole atf [https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/47803#vanilla\\_tobacco\\_by\\_sixstrings952](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/47803#vanilla_tobacco_by_sixstrings952)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Whiskey Cavendish - 10% Tobacco Blend with a Whiskey flavoring**\n\n*SM: Whiskey Cavendish is a mixture of Burley, Virginia and Black Cavendish tobaccos with an outstanding whiskey flavoring recipe to achieve a remarkable flavor and aroma – mellow but satisfying. Use @ 8-10%*\n\nMe: finally a complex flavor. I like this one, I can taste the whiskey in it but it's a slightly sweet flavor more than a boozy note. This works as a complex stand alone. There;s lots to this aroma. The bacco blend hits all the points i like. I think this works as a stand alone and shows what can be done with these flavors and the right blend/mix.\n\nRelatable flavors: Much less bold The Southerner. Like a southerner one shot lite.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Aged Burley - 10%**\n\n*SM: A mid to full bodied smoke. When mixed in with a lighter shag, it brings out the manly back notes that you may desire. Earthy, nice throat hit. Use @ 6-10%*\n\nMe: great smell off this one before i even tried it. Slight nutty taste and only a hint of sweet. I like the body on this one, full and low. It could stand as the main note in a mix. Definitely not kidding about the throat hit. It feels like just the right mid-base note, but not as in your face as the FLV version. perhaps they are right about the 'manly back notes' (is that hairiness?). I'd maybe pair this with sweet brightleaf? If you are used to Flv Red Burley, this is a much more mellow nuttiness yet also an as distinct flavor. If you are tired of flv RB then I'd get this one.\n\nRelatable flavors: Much less bold Flv Red burley.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Brazilian Viso - 10%**\n\n*SM: A nice dry, not sweet shag. In the medium range it can provide body to many a mix. Use as a filler with some Nicaraguan Seco or Burley. Steep minimum of 2 weeks for full flavor. Use @ 6-8% standalone @ 10%*\n\nMe: Noticeably less sweet than the rest. Maybe not necessarily in a good way but I could see this being added to one of the sweeter ones to bring it down a notch. Has a nice woody flavor that is very different from the rest. rather enjoyable on it's own and I could see this being the 'cured for body' fix for the NET range at 4-6%. At 10% it doesnt seem to hold up to the complexity of the WC or HP. Not sure how much filler burley needs. I'd like to pair it with something that will play well with the woody notes. American Virginian or the Burley perhaps?\n\nRelatable flavors: Hints of woody like Vanilla for pipe but without the vanilla/pipe-y muskiness. And not as strong; just a hint. Definitely more of a cig type.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Supreme - 6% Tobacco Blend**\n\nSM: *A nice combination of three different shags….Nicaraguan Ligero Filler,Connecticut Broadleaf Binder,and Havana Wrapper. For a bold and smooth taste! Use @ 6-10%*\n\nMe: Tried this at the lower end for once. Big Mistake, meaning I just want more. Surprisingly the flavor is there but im not picking up the flavor like the other samples and i regret it because this has a very good flavor as a stand alone. This one is complex enough to be vaped solo. Only a hint of sweet, the combination flavor here is working to make a nice well rounded tobacco. At 6, it’s not failing to deliver the flavor, I just can’t get behind it this low, despite it being dark and rich.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Wild strawberry Tea - 8% Green tea w/SB**\n\nSM: Japanese Sencha green tea with a refreshing strawberry and papaya. Recommended at 4-8%\n\nMe: at 8% this delivers a powerful SB flavor. Slightly floral with a decent throat hit, it’s sweet with a little bit of green from the tea, a nice match. Not a green like a stem from a strawberry, but just adding to the fullness of the flavor. It’s a nice complement. Not sure im picking up on the papaya at all. Sweet almost powdery sugar. I might add some SB flavoring to this to round it out a bit if i wanted a fuller SB but it works here solo. The tea is not very pronounced and low in the background as that slight green, not astringent, just a hint. I dont think I would mess with this too much. Maybe just something to boost the tea notes or fill out the berry? Maybe just use this in place of SB in some regular recipes since I am not crazy for the SB sweets. Definitely worth the test.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion**: The Supreme or Whiskey Cavendish if you want an all-in-one flavor good to go. Overall, not nearly as good in mtl imo; the subtlety that makes them so smooth and fun to vape is lost. Not really cost effective but for the tobacco lovers, they are worth a try and really interesting to vape. I find that when I switch back over to the flv/inw mixes i have, I feel they are clumsy and overbearing at first by comparison to the SM flavors. As a general statement, they were all pretty sweet so if that's a problem, go Brazilian Viso for sure for a less sweet cig style. The tea was an interesting vape more for the SB flavor (which isn't really my passion) and seemed so forward compared to any combination of SB i've ever had. Thanks for reading, hope this helps!",

Nothing fluffy or creamy, just like someone took a rope of black licorice and melted it down into something mildly alcoholic  mixed with some herbs.   It is fairly close to what drinking Absinthe tastes like, minus some of the booze.\n\n**Off-flavors:** None.\n\n**Throat hit:** 7/10 pretty robust and slightly harsh\n\n**Uses:** This is what you will want to use to impart a strong boozy black licorice note to your recipe.  6-7% in a recipe has been reported if you're really a fool for black licorice, however I think 3-5% should do the trick just fine. This could also be used <1% to impart a \"coolness\" to your recipe if Koolada is just too much for you.\n\n**Pairings:**   Some FA Whiskey to impart a bit more booziness, also dark fruits, citrus fruits, chocolate, herbs/spices, caramel, even some mints and darker tobaccos would pair well here.\n\n**Notes:**  Definitely a love or hate flavor.  It's rather crass by itself, but it's a must if you're after black licorice or a true fennel/anise without the creaminess FA Anise carries.  This flavor can be enjoyable at very low % even if you're not a full on fan of black licorice, but if you find it to be too much, try FA Anise for a lighter, creamier taste and smoother mouth feel.\n\n[Link to all of our flavor reviews in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)\n\nEdit:words",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** TPA Apple (Green Tart), 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 6 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Tart green apple top notes. No real body.  Doesn't quite feel like a full flavor, at least the tested percentages. It's missing anything crisp, juicy, fleshy or any other mouthfeel elements you'd expect with an apple. For being just the top notes, it's fairly realistic but a bit nondescript.\n\nOn the bright side, this doesn't have most of the baggage that usually shows up with green apple flavors. Manages to avoid tasting like green apple jolly ranchers.  It's not really candy sweet.\n\nThere's also a pretty solid tartness here without an aggressive sour or acidic note.  [Admittedly, the component list for this looks suspiciously short, but it doesn't include any malic or citric acid.](http://shop.perfumersapprentice.com/componentlist.aspx?sku_search=71100315)\n\nLight grassy, acetone note to this, but it isn't super prominent relative to the tartness.\n\nThis feels a lot more like a tool to turn apples green than a full green apple flavor.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Some of the usual suspects for green apple flavors, but not as overwhelming as some other concentrates.  Grassy, bordering on acetone chemical note.  Closer to just straight grassy, but there is a little bit of a more bitter chemical edge.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Fairly harsh.  It isn't unbearable, but it's definitely a bit much as a solo flavor.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  Concentration testing solo is a bit weird, because it doesn't really have a full apple flavor underneath it.\n\nTesting this at 1%, it has some noticeable tartness and a bit of grassiness. It doesn't really evoke green apples at this percentage, but it doesn't feel out of place.\n\nAt 2%, It's now tasting more apple-esque, but still just the top notes. Tartness hasn't really increased, but it is a bit more grassy and green. harshness also seems to be picking up.\n\nAt 3%, It's getting harsher and the thinness coupled with that grassiness is a bit strange.  More identifiable green apple.\n\nAt 4%, the harshness is pretty overwhelming, at least solo.  Also starting to taste a bit more like acetone and it's getting slightly bitter.\n\nAt 6%, it's harshy, bitter, and grassy.\n\nI'd use this an accent to a juicier, fuller apple concentrate between 1.5-3% depending on how sharp of a green apple top note you'd like.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Again, this feels like it's TPA's version of just the part of an apple flavor that makes it green.  This is just one of TPA's green apple flavors, but looking at the component lists, [TPA Apple (Tart Granny Smith)](http://shop.perfumersapprentice.com/componentlist.aspx?sku_search=343135) lists 16 components not including water, ethyl alcohol, and propylene glycol, [TPA Green Apple](http://shop.perfumersapprentice.com/componentlist.aspx?sku_search=309457) lists 19, and this [has 2.](http://shop.perfumersapprentice.com/componentlist.aspx?sku_search=71100315)\n\nI'd use this with a juicier apple, like one of the fujis, to pull it closer to a realistic green apple. Something like TPA Dragonfruit would probably help emulsify and blend the flavors even further.\n\nYou could probably also use it with the apple blend flavors like INW Two Apples to add more tart green apple.\n\nThis may have some use to enhance tartness in fruit mixes without adding too identifiable of a green apple note.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  Not a whole lot easily searchable about this.  This is relatively new on BCF, so maybe it's a newer flavor.\n\n[Here is the ELR Page, but only a couple of short notes. User \"JonDelves\" is quoting someone named \"Robert\": \"nice crisp apple taste not bitter like some or to sweet like others as soon has you open the bottle you get the smell of apple.\" User \"aldykuzut\" writes: \"TFA version is better than capella green apple, mixing with FA Fuji apple to get authentic apple flavor. preferred mixing at 1.5 - 2% and 6% for single flavor use.\"  User \"Hollywood VApes\" writes: \"Mine tastes like alcohol or something and was taking forever to steep out. Once it did it was good like a green apple jolly rancher type flavor, but I have been using Cap green apple and I think it has similar issues but didn't take as long to steep.\"](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/630)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

If it already has fruit in it, it will blend well without the apple taking over at lower percentages. \n\n**Pairings:** Creams, custards, caramel, cookies, possibly some nuts or tobacco.  Another apple flavor such as FA Fuji or INW Two Apples if you're after a stronger apple taste.\n\n**Notes:**   To me, this is definitely a crust-forward flavoring, but the apple taste sits noticeably in the background.\n\nEDIT: [Link to all of our flavor reviews in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** TPA Apricot, 3 and 6%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 19 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Relatively \"fresh\" apricot flavor that skirts around a yellow peach.\n\nPretty generic stone fruit taste overall.  It has some of the darker notes from an apricot but a body that feels a lot like a yellow peach flavor.  Those darker notes hit on the beginning of the exhale and kind of stick around in the top notes.  That yellow peach body is sweet and just a bit tart, fairly realistic to something like an actual fruit.  Lighter kind of peach rings vibe that would probably come out with more sweetener.\n\nThere is some light vanilla in here that sticks out a bit, but it doesn't have the same sort of full dried apricot fruit spice thing going on that FA apricot has.  Light, drier peel note with just a bit of a spiciness, less peel than something like FA Fuji.  Not quite as bright as something like a straight peach flavor, but definitely on the \"fresh\" end of the apricot spectrum.  There's a bit of a rhubarb-like green tartness to this, especially at higher percentages.  Pushes towards soapy as you crank up the %'s and that green goes just a bit floral.\n\nMedium dense mouthfeel overall with a bit of stickiness to it, maybe just a hint of wax.  Less jammy than FA Apricot, but definitely stickier and less juicy than most yellow peach flavor.  Sweetness level is relatively high for a fruit but stops short of going full candy.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Quite a bit of peach in here.  Gets green, slightly vegetal notes at higher percentages than can come off a bit soapy.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Light to moderate.  That peel note can get a bit harsh, but doesn't seem to have that real intense linalool sting you get with peach flavors.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 3%  I'm getting more slightly dark yellow peach than really heavy apricot.  Light green note.  Medium body overall.  Nothing really floral.\n\nAt 6% this is quite a bit more green and I'm getting a light floral edge.  Vape seems a bit sticky and dry without being really deep and jammy.  Prettily heavy sweet and sort of an artificial peach flavor.  Feels a bit overflavored here.\n\nJust based on these tests, I'd probably be using this as a more non-descript accent at around 2%.  Should give you most of the sweetness, some additional body, and some fruity notes that blend pretty well.  If you want to push this to the front of a mix I'd go for around 4%, with the caveat that you'll get something a little green.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Probably not the apricot you'd reach for bakeries or robust tobacco mixes.  That bit of green is going to make it difficult to pair well with creams.\n\nShould pair relatively well with brighter fruits like strawberries, blueberries, or citrus.\n\nShould pair really well with thinner peaches like FA White Peach to flesh out the base and give mixes a bit more depth.  Could also provide some support to tarter cherry, plum, or even grape mixes.\n\nYou could run with the green thing if you dig weird, and bring in some rhubarb, cactus, or a tarter more tannic pear.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  [Here's the ELR Page.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/7035)  User \"baseballmom\" writes: \"Strong, delicious...been on apricot kick lately. Goes great with mango, peach...working on apricot and vanilla cream. 4% or less. Love the smell, love the taste. Actually have had caps version, yeah I prefer tfa' s apricot.\"\n\nUser \"TheFlavorSeeker\" still hasn't found what their looking for: \"unfortunately contains whatever component that TPA uses that causes \"spiciness\" - it has Vanillin and it's probably that for me. i can also sense the alcohol (chest tightness) - SF test at 5% 5 day steep - spiciness disappeared after adding a drop of sweetener (sucralose) to the 5ml test sample, so there's hope there, but it's still a lot of \"peach\"profile: taste is not my expected Apricot (the yellow type) - i was hoping for a lot more natural, sweeter (ripe) and fruity apricot - this tastes more like Peach mixed with vanilla :(\nwill try other vendor brands and use this at a very low % (2%) maybe to support peach mixes and work around that bite of spiciness\"\n\n[Mostly positive reviews on BCF.](https://www.bullcityflavors.com/apricot-tfa/)  \"Les Hollday\" seems to dig it: \"Great flavor (I love apricots) When you take the cap off and take a whiff, it's like a bowl of cut up apricots in front of you. So clean and fresh. I would recommend this flavor to anyone.\"  User \"joanj\" questions the ripeness of their apricots: \"The flavor is apricot but more of a tart green bite to it than the traditional mellow sweetness that I expected and was looking for. I can sweeten or add a cream of some sort to get it there but just don't feel I should have to.\"\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Max VG, steeped 7 days.\n* **Flavor Description:** Banana with a heavy cream/custard. It is similar to a banana pudding. \n* **Off-flavors:** Not one that I can place. Maybe a very light Runts, but not nearly as bad as LA Banana Cream.\n* **Throat Hit:** 0/10.\n* **Uses & Pairings:** This flavoring definitely has its uses. If you just want a nice Banana pudding, this is a great base to work with. I think this would pair well with Cinnamon, Caramel, Cakes, Pies, Basically anything that is not fruit. Not that this wouldn't pair with fruit, but we have LA Banana Cream that is fantastic with pairing with fruits. So keep this paired with your more bakery, milkshake, pudding type flavors.  \n* **Notes:** This flavor definitely has its place as I said before. It should not be a competition between LA and TFA for these two flavors because they have 2 completely different uses. We should add both flavors to our toolbox and use them accordingly.   \n\nIf you are looking for more mixing related content subscribe to my [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcfR6mXMRm-Iu3psoDrxGyA)\n\nIf your opinion differs from mine or you have anything to add feel free to comment below, and as always Keep Mixing!",

The bakery part comes mostly out during the exhale, during the inhale it is mostly banana. Hidden between the bakery and the banana are some nuts, some sugar and a slight alcohol accent. On the sweet side (7/10) and with enough moisture (7/10).\n\n**Off-flavors:** The initial impression of the flavour is melon/cantaloupe but if you really put in your mind the idea of a banana nut bread then you focus back. Still, in my opinion it is there.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Pretty low at this percentage (3/10).\n\n**Uses:** I have a hard time not imagining this being the main ingredient of a recipe with \"enchantments\" - it has a pretty wide flavour palette. Alternatively it could a banana enhancer in a recipe with other more fruit centric bananas.\n\n**Pairings:** More nuts, more alcohol (rum, whiskey), more bakery (cookies, crusts, etc), other buttery flavours and sugar. It would be probably also interesting to try to pair with tobaccos.\n\n**Notes:** It is probably soft at 6% for a totally stand-alone flavour.\n\n**Rating:** 4/5. Could be 3+ and could be 5- because on one hand I find it interesting and flavourful but on the other hand (and due to the lack of experience from my side) I find it hard to imagine how I would use it as a raw ingredient in a recipe that I would create.",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** TPA Berry Mix @ %3, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 11 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  TPA calls this \"A fresh tasting blend of raspberry, blueberry, and other berry flavors!\" and I sort of see it.  To me, at least, this tastes like a blueberry and pomegranate mix.  It's a berry mix though, I'm sure if you gave this 10 people they'd pick out 10 different flavors.  There is some brighter, candy blueberry in here up front, but a syrupy pomegranate underneath it with just some medicinal tasting camphor.\n\nInhale is warm, syrupy candy blueberry / raspberry. Not super tart or anything, but with enough brightness it doesn't go full pancake syrup.  Exhale has a syrupy red-berry kind of base with some higher blueberry top notes. Good amount of actual skin in those top notes, with some tartness and tannic bitterness. That base is mostly just red sweetness, no real tartness or identifiable \"berry.\" Doesn't taste a whole like raspberry or anything, but there is a medicinal woody camphor note underneath everything. Fairly sweet and dense, but the sweetness is pretty neutral, with no weird off-notes.  A bit of a jammy mouthfeel, and some lingering sugar-lips going on.  Otherwise finish is fairly clean, with some lingering medicinal woody taste.\n\nBig caveat here is that I can't taste much in the way of strawberries, so this may have a bit more a strawberry character to it. I didn't see it mentioned as a dominant flavor anywhere else so I'm skeptical, just wanted to throw that out there.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Well, that camphor / woody taste going on is a bit jarring. Tastes a lot like FA Pomegranate.  I don't find it overwhelming, but I kind of enjoy that weird warm woody note.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Light to moderate? This seems like a flavor that people will different sensitivity. I get a really deep throat / almost chest hit  that's noticeable but not super harsh.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  By all indications, this is largely similar to CAP's harvest fruit, so pretty much that usage.  I see that stuff being used a lot in cheesecakes and creamy applications but I'm not completely sold. That camphor-woodiness doesn't seem like a great match with creams, custards, and bakeries... but people end up pulling it off.\n\nPersonally, I'd sort of relegate this to fruitier mixes.  Should go well with citrus especially something sweeter like lemonade. I'd also mix with brighter berries like Strawberry or Raspberry, or tarter stuff like Acai or Blackcurrant.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nS&V concentration testing, this seems fairly weak at 1%.  Just sort of a light, tart accent. Sweeter, but not overwhelming at 2%. Jammy mouthfeel is starting to come in a bit but doesn't feel super saturated.  3% tastes a whole lot more red, with those tarter blueberries playing with a jammy base fairly well. 4% is starting to get a bit woody for me, sweetness is also fairly intense. 5% is definitely medicinal, sweetness has hit a plateau and I'm losing the tarter blueberries. 6% just tastes like a sort of bad, syrupy, pomegranate. I'd mix with this at 2-3% if you're using other berries to fill out a mix. I'd probably go up to 4% if you're using a more dominant citrus and 5% if you want to smooth out the berries and the citrus by adding some EM or Cactus or something.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[/u/Sandcastles/ quick take: \"Tastes pretty similar to harvest berry from capella but maybe a little bit more tart, I mixed it at 8%.\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/4xkt47/has_anyone_else_tried_tfa_berry_mix/)  I haven't had Harvest Berry (the horror!) but [here is wh1skey's review.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/57jab1/cap_harvest_berry/)\n\n[Here's some information from an ECF post, user \"gramdogg\" is comparing TPA Berry Mix to CAP Harvest Berry. Final conclusion: \"Yeah TFA Berry Mix is even worse, had to let it steep about a month and mix it with 1/4 something else... blueberry or raspberry. Basically add a berry mix to make Berry Mix taste like a good berry mix lol.\"](https://www.e-cigarette-forum.com/forum/threads/best-mixed-berry.787765/) \n\n[ELR page isn't super useful.

One could argue that cloves, chocolate and vanilla are off flavors considering this has the word honey in the name, and I get zero honey from it.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Position In A Recipe:**\n\n- Bury it in the base notes to add depth to an authentic pipe blend or Turkish style tobacco\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Suggested Percentage:**\n\n-  2-3% (even at 3% it's very mild)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Pairings:**\n\n- FLV Red Burley\n- SC (or FE) Black Mile\n- FE Turkish\n- FLV Virginia\n- INW Virginia Tobacco Absolute\n- any chocolate/vanilla cigar blend\n- any Turkish style tobacco blend\n- teas!! (I'm thinking Chai tea but it could spice up an herbal tea quite nicely.)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- I am so pleasantly surprised by this flavor for a few reasons.. First and foremost, I really hate clove cigarettes and even though I'm tasting clove here, it's truly delightful. Second, I've been sleeping on this flavor forever. Bought it on my first order, tried it in my first recipe which was understandably horrible and blamed it on the flavorings instead of my inexperience. Never tried this flavor again until now.\n- Because I was confused and curious about this flavor, I went ahead and whipped up another batch for SnV at 3%. I'm getting pretty much the same effect as the steeped version.\n- Overall, this is worth having in the tool belt. It's not a \"oh my god tobacco\" but will be very useful in a spicy blend. Can't fuckin believe it. Good job TPA.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Wikipedia entry on Black Honey which does not explain why I don't taste honey in TPA Black Honey**\n\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuromitsu",

This may be because of it being something that is originally made for food so it is not used to being heated up the way it is in vaping. \n* **Off-flavors:** It kind of has a caramel-y taste. It is also slightly burnt, especially at higher temps. IF you go any higher than 2% it will start to taste like a campfire, and not in a good way.  \n* **Throat Hit:**2/10\n* **Uses & Pairings:** This will always find a way into bakery type flavors. Pies, Cakes, and Very Bright and Very Dark fruits. It could be good in Flambe recipes like Bananas Foster, Cherries Jubilee, or Christmas Pudding.   \n* **Notes:** The problem with this flavor is that you may want to add just a hint of brown sugar and reach for this flavor, but it is not light enough to be brown sugar.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** TPA Bubblegum (Fruity), 3% and 6%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 7 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Juicy Fruit gum, more or less.\n\nThe (Fruity) part of this seems fairly accurate to juicy fruit.  It's that same kind of indistinct mixture of banana and pineapple [which I guess is mostly Isoamyl Acetate.](http://smellslikescience.com/honey-bees-whiskey-and-juicy-fruit-gum/)  I feel like there is some very soft candy lemon making it a bit more tart, but it's basically juicy fruit.  And just like juicy fruit, the flavor here seems fairly transient.  The fruit note here settles in for me really quickly and just becomes sort of a fruity background noise.  So it's basically like juicy fruit after the third chew.  Not a strong fruit flavor, heavier on the \"gum\" part of this.\n\nThe gum here seems more in the \"stick\" instead of \"ball\" camp.  There's a slightly bitter top note that is actually making me thing of the artificial color used in gumball shells, but it's pretty light and just makes the fruit taste a bit more artificial.   Light cooling wintergreen effect, but not as cool as a normal pink bubble gum.  The gum tastes a bit stale here, more on the dry side but I'm not getting anything too harsh.  The fruitiness keeps this tasting from too chalky or powdery though.\n\nFuller texture here.  Isn't over the top chewy but tastes fairly solid.  Sweetness level is also pretty accurately juicy fruit.  Sweet but not too syrupy or cloying. Seems like a fit for the profile.\n\nThe only other Juicy Fruit type flavor I've tried is FW Juicy Fruit.  To me, the FW version probably gives a more accurate mouthfeel to a stick of gum covered in chalky cornstarch, and has a stronger gum base flavor complete with a slightly more pronounced pink bubblegum cooling.  The TPA version has a more distinct fruitiness and has a flavor slightly more like a gumball complete with a bit of a hard candy shell note.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Light bitter top note.  Nothing else off profile, really.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  I don't get much throat hit out of this.  Seems relatively smooth to me, especially compared to TPA's regular bubblegum.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 3%, I'm getting a really indistinct fruit note.  More \"fruity\" than anything in specific but falls into that banana/pineapple kind of category.  Texture starts a bit juicy than dries out a bit on the tail end of the exhale.  Moderately thick.\n\nAt 6%, the fruit is coming through a bit clearer.  Base is still juicy-fruit, but I'm getting some citrus.  Light bitter top note. Thicker texture but a bit dry. Starts to pick up a light cooling like pink bubblegum but less pronounced.\n\nJust based on these tests, I'd probably use this around 4% as a bubble gum base if you don't want it to be too reminiscent of juicy fruit and you're primarily after texture.  I'd be closer to 7-8% for a primary note or solo flavor.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Good option for a fruitier gum base instead of trying to make a normal bubblegum taste less pink.  Jackfruit basically tastes like juicy fruit, so you could amp up the flavor here with some TPA Jackfruit.  Good pairing with anything tropical-ish like mango, pineapple, or banana.  Should work well lemons and oranges as well.\n\nOutside of just making a fruitier gum, this could be used as a textural element in fruit candy mixes.  This doesn't have the heavier \"gum\" flavor of FW Juicy Fruit, or the heavier cooling or the spice notes of a pink bubble gum.  Throwing a syrupy fruit at this will soften it while still retaining some of the denser mouthfeel.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nTPA states this was previously named \"Bubblegum (Juicy).\"  [There's an ELR page up for \"Bubblegum (Fruity/Juicy), So I'm guessing that's the relevant one.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/16279)  User \"Chachi Vapes\" writes: \"This is essentially a pink bubblegum, but more on the chalky realm. It is similar to Bazooka Joe, Double Bubble, gum balls etc. Off-flavors: It just has a chalky taste, but that goes along with the bubblegum nature. Throat Hit:1/10.  Uses & Pairings:This would go well with pretty much any fruit. you could change your bubblegum to any fruit, mint, or anything like that.\"  User \"SiliconeDrones\" writes: \"Simple. Just like juicy fruit gum.  6% is really nice, adding 0.5% koolada makes it more realistic to the gum.

No fizziness like you'd expect from the name, but somewhat reminiscent of flat champagne.  \n\n**Off-flavors:**  May seem a bit yeasty at higher percentages.  Missing the fizzy champagne sparkle.\n\n**Throat hit:** 2/10 Pretty tame on the tongue too.\n\n**Uses:**  Since it doesn't really provide effervescence (at least to me), I would suggest it as an accent to other fruits, or as a sort of emulsifier to help meld sharp flavors together.\n\n**Pairings:** Grape, apple, citrus flavors, or any other fruits you might expect in wine.\n\n**Notes:**   IMO, not an overly strong flavor, rather boring by itself.  FA Liquid Amber or FA Brandy at lower percentages might work as substitutes in a recipe if you don't have this one in your stash.\n\nEDIT: As /u/apexified stated in my recent discussion about this flavor, FW Pink Champagne might be a better option for a fizzy note. \n\nEDIT 2: For those of you still searching for effervescence, check out [FA Cola](https://redd.it/59bs68).

    "markdown": "**Setup:** Recoil w/ flavor barrel, Dual 12 wrap 24g 3.5mm SS316 @.33 ohms. 60w power, 450F temp limit. Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** TPA Cherry Extract, 3% and 6%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 27 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Hey, this isn't a dumpster fire! Thinner with an artificial edge, but not horrendous.\n\nSomewhere between [the candy red cherry type of profile TPA calls out](https://shop.perfumersapprentice.com/p-7587-cherry-extract-flavor.aspx) and maybe a sweetened cherry juice.  On the realistic side, definitely leans closer to a more traditional deep red bing cherry flavor. I do get a very light tartness here, and some body that isn't so much juicy as just not all that dry.  I seem to feel the tartness more on the inhale and it's pretty lost by the exhale.\n\nLight, delicate sweetness that has some of those more artificial cherry candy notes. Not much body or vibrancy here.  It's a thin flavor without feeling too dry.  Doesn't get any more vibrant or deep with increasingly higher percentages.\n\nBut it doesn't taste like gasoline fumes or burning plastic.  So score it as a win.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  This is just a bit medicinal and bitter at higher percentages.  It's like a 3 out of 10, so it's remarkable for a cherry, but still seems to be hiding somewhere in the background.  Also doesn't respond all that well to sweetener in a primary role, seems to pick up a pretty heavy aspartame kind of diet soda vibe with at least CAP Super Sweet, FW Sweetener, TPA Sweetener, and FLV Sweetness.  Thinner without much actual body.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light.  Little bit of a sting at higher percentages, but nothing major.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 3%, this is really light. Leans more toward realistic, but pretty subtle. Sort of a watered down cherry juice flavor. Not much body or sweetness, with a light tartness.\n\nAt 6%, a bit more solid but still on the light side.  Still lighter tartness, but feels a bit fuller and more realistic.  Simultaneously picks up some more of that hard candy sweetness and some \"red\" candy type notes.\n\nI've used this up to 15%, and I don't think it really helps the situation.  This is going to be hard to use as a primary note in a mix, it just gets pushed around. I'd keep it around 4-6% as an accent.  Gets a bit bitter above that in mixes.  If you did want to use it as primary note, I'd use around 8% and use really mellow fruits or creams.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I've actually been screwing around with this quite a bit.  It's a fairly flexible cherry flavor.  Not the ideal cherry for any application, but it can fit most places you'll put it without being terrible.\n\nIt's candied enough to work in sweeter, candy profiles where you're looking for a more artificial cherry flavor. It doesn't really have the body to stand alone as a primary flavor, but it could be backed up by a smaller percentage of one of the terrible candy cherries, or mixed in other berry flavors like raspberry or strawberry to provide a cherry accent.  Also works well with the swedish fish-esque genre of flavors like FA Blackcurrant or CAP 27 Fish for a brighter red candy note that doesn't taste like a burning pile of tires.\n\nAlternatively, it's not too candied for more realistic fruit mixes, again primarily in an accent role.  It's a bit weak and thin to try to take center stage, and any other bright flavor you throw in a mix is going to push this around quite a bit. You can actually hack together a fairly decent rainier type cherry with this and a more mellow apricot like Capellas.  For darker bing type cherries, I'd look at filling it out with plum and maybe a light touch of a darker grape flavor.\n\nAnd it seems to work okay in bakery applications. Coupling it up with some FA or INW Marzipan actually gives a pretty decent, slightly dark bakery cherry.  This may actually work for your cherry pastries and creams.\n\nAlso, tobacco, why not? Maybe stay away from anything intensely sweet to keep it from getting too candied. Feels like it would work more like an artificial swisher type cherry flavor than a robust pipe cherry... so maybe keep it pretty subtle.\n\nAnd just to list every possible profile, should work well in beverages.  Could probably pass for the black cherryish flavor in Dr. Pepper, or the slightly brighter cherry coke flavor.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  Apparently this has been around for a while, but BCF just picked it up so I'm officially calling out anyone who had been sitting on this miraculously not awful cherry.  You're literally the worst for not bringing this up in the [Cherry FOTW post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/7p7moj/this_flavor_of_the_week_is_poppin_cherries/)\n\n[Noted did a show on cherries, which is worth a watch if you like seeing ID10-T contemplate suicide for 70 minutes.

Overall fairly artificial and slightly soapy.  Probably closest to TPA Philippine Mango of the mangoes I've tried, but soapier than that. Almost a fruity shampoo kind of vibe, with some floral weirdness there.  Not a lot of realistic juicy body or a heavier artificial mango flavor. Almost like a painfully underripe mango without much sweetness or flavor and a tiny bit of dish soap.\n\nChili here is mostly just plain capsaicin spiciness.  I don't pick up much in the way of an actual chile flavor here. Maybe some slightly earthy and smoky notes, but I think it's just the throat hit from the spiciness.  Overall, could actually be a bit spicier?  Maybe normal pasilla hot, nothing intense. It's just a bit of stinging spiciness but nothing particularly full that lingers.\n\nModerate fullness for a fruit, but this actually feels a bit undersweet for a full mango flavor.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Just the spice from the chili, mango is soapy and underripe.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Well, \"Chili\" so there's a pretty aggressive throat hit.  More spice than normal sting though.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 3%, the mango here is a bit swamped by that spice.  Lighter mango flavor but some of the soapy notes are pretty well masked by that chile.  Seems to work relatively well here.\n\nAt 6% the mango tastes more soapy and floral.  Not much spicier than 3%.\n\nJust based on these tests, I'd probably start around 4% with this a primary flavor.  I'd use as an accent around 2%, where you're just getting some of that spicy and some mild fruitiness\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Interesting, but not really pleasant solo flavor.\n\nYou could theoretically through some CAP golden pineapple at this to try to mask some of that soapy weirdness and use the spiciness against that. Would also bend into a spicy cactus flavor with enough INW Cactus.  Would also go well with a brighter citrusy flavor to stand in for something like tamarind.  Or a realistic watermelon like FW Red Summer or FLV Watermelon and try to turn it into more of a melon.  Or just go nuts and add some FLV Candy Roll or TPA/FW Sweet and Tart and go for some kind of weird, powdery mexican candy thing.\n\nThis doesn't really deliver on the chile part of the equation, you could probably get a similar effect with a better mango and some FW Capsicum or FLV Heat.  Still need to try INW Shisha Chili Hot spice to see if there's a better actual chile flavor available.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  [There is actually an ELR Page up for this.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/201628)  User \"VoyagerVapor\" writes: \"A nice, sweet mango with a touch of heat.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** TPA Cola Fizz, 3% and 6%, others noted, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 13 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** An additive with just the acid and spicy herbal notes out of cola.\n\nThis doesn't taste anything like an actual can of Coke.  It's just the actual cola and acid part divorced from the heavier caramel and vanilla body. Accurate, sharp herbal notes that pick up some astringency and green bitterness solo.  There's also a pretty heavy tart, almost sour, bite to this as well.  Does a good job of emulating that acidic bite from the phosphoric acid in sharper sodas.  Doesn't just feel like a more traditional malic/citric acid kind of tartness you get with traditional sour additives.  Also doesn't seem to be as corrosive to the underlying flavor as those sour additives, at least on a relatively short steep with another sweeter, fuller flavor underneath.  \n\nThis is definitely an additive as opposed to a full cola flavor.  That's where the \"fizz\" comes in.  This is not a miracle silver bullet to carbonated mouthfeel in a vape, but it does replicate what generally passes as effervescence in other flavors.  Basically, if you get something sparkling out of FW Pink Champagne or TPA Ginger Ale, this should work as a fizz.  It's a combination of the sharper spice notes and the acidity that doesn't actually produce the tactile sensation of bubbles in a soda but pretty closely replicates the sharp, acidic bite on the palate. At 1%, as an additive, I'll say it's noticeably more effervescent than anything I've ever got off another spicier cola like FA Cola.  Not really a foamy, creamy mouthfeel like FLV Root Beer, but it does evoke a solid fizz.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  It has a cola flavor and whatever passes as a fizz to it.  Unpleasant as a solo flavor, but nothing chemical or off profile.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Solo, this is pretty intense.  Bitter, hard throat hit.  Also adds a bit of additional throat hit to a mix, but nothing too intense up to 1% and it kind of helps sell the acidity of a cola base.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  Probably not a solo flavor.  At 3%, this is bitter and herbal and slightly astringent.  Heavy tartness.  Just the herbaceous parts of a cola with no real body to give any kind of fizz to.\n\nI am not a smart man, and I mixed a solo tester of this at 6%.  I would advise against that.  Legitimately spicy with intense bitterness.  Clearly higher than intended.\n\nAfter trying this at 6% and being vaguely horrified, I mixed up a couple more testers with LB Cola Freeze at 10%.  At .5% cola fizz, it does help to inject some life into the flatter sweeter Cola Freeze.  I'm not sure I'm getting too much distinct fizz at that percentage, but it makes the cola more vibrant and adds a more realistic kind of acidic bite.  At 2% Cola Fizz, I am getting some bitterness and herbal notes that aren't quite meshing with the cola freeze.  Seems to be hitting that fizz thing better, but flavor is probably a bit intense.\n\nJust based on these tests, this is going to be an accent flavor.  I'd probably start at .25% if you just a bit of vibrancy and acidity to a flatter cola flavor.  I'd probably top out around 1% unless you're specifically going for some of those bitter, herbal notes.  If you're trying to get weird with this, I'd probably go for about 2% in cocktail applications with other aggressive flavors.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Pretty obvious to use this as a relatively \"fizzy\" cola booster to give flatter cola some brightness and vibrancy. FA Cola is already fairly spice heavy, so I'd keep it really subtle with that one, but this should work a whole lot better with something like LB Cola Freeze or TPA Cola Syrup.\n\nGood to get the \"cola\" in a soda base if you want to build your own.  Should work for a root beer with the right supporting flavors.\n\nWould work well for a cola gummy type of vape.  The tartness is going to go to bring it more toward a sour cola gummy, but the lack of caramel and vanilla is going to be an asset there.  You'd need to use a candy texturizer to get the body right, but this already tastes like the cola from those haribo gummy colas.\n\nSpicy herbal notes for a amaro or other herbal liqueur vape.  Would work fairly well as a dash of bitters in a cocktail vape that already had a cola in there.\n\n**Second Opinions:** Nah, not that I've found.\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** TPA Cotton Candy (Circus), 3% and 6%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 21 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Blue flavored Ethyl Maltol.\n\nSo, like all of the other cotton candy flavors I've tried this is mostly ethyl maltol.  A lot of ethyl maltol.  Same kind of dry, spun sugar, almost unpleasant fullness and scratchy harshness. [TPA's spec sheet lists EM out at under 5%, but I'm guessing it's pretty close to the full 5%.](https://shop.perfumersapprentice.com/componentlist.aspx?sku_search=344456)  Just as a basis of comparison, TPA's normal cotton candy is 10% EM.  Even at half the strength of the normal cotton candy, this is still intensely sweet.\n\nBeyond the cotton candy base, I get mostly vanilla with some kind of indistinct berry.  Bright, commercial vanilla.  Same kind of vanillin effect as a marshmallow flavor. Dry, without any kind of vanilla cream component.  The berry here mostly just tastes blue.  Hard to pick out much nuance.  Lacking some depth to call it a full blue raspberry, but feels like some of that tart artificial blue modifier.  Bitter and almost earthy on top that cotton candy base.  I also get a pretty distinct plastic type taste to this, at least steeped for 3 weeks.\n\nI've tried at least a couple of other blue cotton candy flavors.  FW Blueberry Cotton Candy actually vapes quite a bit better than the TPA version. Instead of feeling like straight flavored ethyl maltol, FW is a bit smoother with a less bitter and artificial blue flavor.  CAP Blue Raspberry Cotton Candy is about as dry as this, but I get a more saturated, truer blue raspberry flavor. \n\n**Off-flavors:** Fruit-ish flavor here is bitter and plastic. I also get something vaguely earthy in with those fruitier notes.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Dry, scratchy, and harsh.  Pretty normal for this much ethyl maltol and standard for cotton candy flavors.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 3%, still aggressively sweet.  Solid cotton candy mouthfeel.  I get more vanilla than blue flavor here.  Light plastic notes with a strange earthiness.\n\nAt 6%, this is personally way too sweet, dry, and harsh.  Bluer, but those earthy plastic notes are very strong.\n\nJust based on these tests, I would keep this in an accent role.  I'd probably top out around 2% as basically a sweetener for a profile this would work with.  I realize that some people end up cranking these cotton candy flavors way up, but personally, it's just a deeply unpleasant vape. More like vaping fiberglass insulation than cotton candy.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I'd just use this as a sweetener, at about double percentage you'd use for straight EM or TPA Cotton Candy.  Use primarily in candy or sweeter profiles that could work with the fruitier note here.  Not much to recommend it over CAP Blue Raspberry Cotton Candy in those applications though.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  [Here's the ELR Page.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/30933)  User \"aSquared\" writes: \"Really plastic, chemical taste when first mixed, use sparingly - this unwanted flavour does start to diminish after about a week steeping, works well with strawberry flavours and candy fruit flavourings. Wouldn't use this primarily, TPA Cotton Candy is preferred.\"  User \"Jamison\" writes: \"2% max to sweeten up and add a blueish add to a mix - would be good to an already blue raz mix, kinda dull flavor. will go burnt at high %.\"  User \"Loud N Cloudy\" (who also notes they were using a nautilus mini, so context maybe?) writes: \"Great as a 10% SAF (Stand-Alone-Flavor)... Personally, I find it's a pretty decent cotton candy flavor. Quite sweet, but not overwhelming. I get a bit of burnt sugar taste off it now and then, but maybe that's just my PV acting funny from time to time.\"\n\n[ECX reviews are always fun.](http://www.ecigexpress.com/shop/diy-e-liquid/diy-e-liquid-flavors/signature-flavors/signature-sweet-flavors/circus-cotton-candy-flavor-signature.html?p=2)  \"Sandy\" proclaims this to be \"The Real Cotton Candy\" and writes: \"Adds a ton of sweet depth to a mix-- a very unique flavor. Use at very small percentages in a mix. Like others have stated there seems to be a subtle, yet dark note to this, not really licorice, but thats the closest word to describe the flavor. Very complex.\"  \"lp\" is more concerncerned about off notes: \"Taste like black licorice at 5% pretty strong. Not sure how some are using by itself at 10% ill give it a try but not impressed so far.\"  \"Hannah' compares this to straight ethyl maltol: \"I ordered this impulsively just to see if there was a taste difference between this and the regular cotton candy. It does seem to have a slightly more authentic cotton candy taste. SInce I use cotton candy mainly as a sweetener in fruit and candy mixes so I could see this replacing the normal cotton candy.\"\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** TPA Cranberry Sauce, 2 and 5%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 7 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Interesting, but closer to Swedish Fish than to cranberry sauce.\n\nThere are some tarter cranberry top notes in here, but the body doesn't really seem like much like a cranberry flavor.  There's a sweeter, almost candied lingonberry or red currant type of flavor.  Tastes more IKEA than thanksgiving, if that makes any sense at all.  The body of the flavor really does push toward that bright red swedish fish kind of taste.  The tartness takes it away from a candy raspberry, but it doesn't really have the thinner body of a raw cranberry, or the warmer sweeter body of a cooked cranberry or cranberry juice.\n\nTexture here pushes toward the gummy swedish fish thing as well.  It has some of the stickiness you'd expect from a cranberry sauce, but it's too thin and not really jammy. It has some light chewiness which, along with the red candy thing, is hitting more of the candy profile.  This is also fairly sweet, which just reinforces the candy thing.\n\nI pick up a light to moderate red licorice off of this, which has a bit of cherry edge.  The cherryish flavor here gets a bit plastic and odd at higher percentages.\n\nThis isn't an ethyl alcohol bomb like straight TPA Cranberry, but it also don't really taste like cranberry.  [On their product page, TPA pitches this as a non-flammable alternative to their cranberry flavor: A rich, full cranberry flavor. This is also a great, non-flammable alternative to our original Cranberry Flavor!\"](http://shop.perfumersapprentice.com/p-8157-cranberry-sauce-flavor.aspx?keyword=cranberry%20sauce)\n\n**Off-flavors:** Most of it.  I don't really get cranberries here.  It also has some harsher plastic red candy notes that get unpleasant at higher percentages.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Moderate.  Not as harsh as TPA Cranberry but it still has a pretty sizable throat hit.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 2%, I get a red candy accent.  Some tartness, but mostly just tastes \"red.\"  Pretty heavily sweet, without much mouthfeel.\n\nAt 5% this is quite a bit more intense.  I get an overblown, tart swedish fish without as much texture as I'd like. More gummy than jammy.  Starting to pick up some plastic off notes.\n\nI'd mix with this a tarter accent around 1-2% and a primary flavor between 3-4%.  Gets harsh and unpleasantly artificial above that.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I'd pretty much just ditch the cranberry thing.  While it could add some cranberry-esque tartness I don't think it has much of a cranberry flavor.\n\nI'd probably use it red candy flavors, seems like a good base for red sour patch kids if you don't want to go full blown malic acid sour additive.\n\nI can also see it being used to bend red licorice or swedish fish flavors into something a bit more interesting and tart.\n\n**Second Opinions:** I can't find much here.\n\n[Nada on the ELR Page in terms of notes.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** TPA Dark Rum @ 2%, 4% and 8%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 5 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Sour bubblegum, largely similar to [INW Jamaican Rum.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/5wccw1/inw_jamaican_rum/)  Either this tastes nothing like rum, or it just isn't translating the way I'm using it.  The similarity to the INW concentrate makes me think there is something I'm missing here, but it doesn't really taste like rum to me. I get mostly a generic bubblegum kind of fruitiness and some sour, almost apple cider vinegar kind of musty funk at the back end. Seems to be a warming sensation on the back end of the exhale, but it doesn't really taste like rum or feel strictly like an alcohol sensation.  I could kind of see the the molasses-ish taste of a blackstrap rum, but it's really subtle compared everything going on here. If this flavor works for you, it seems pretty weak and will take somewhere pushing 8-10% to really come through.\n\nInhale has something that tastes a whole like juicy fruit gum up front with a tart acidity. Decently sweet, but not that just seems to pushing it further towards gum. Moderate density, but just weird. Exhale has something that maybe a molasses/brown sugar kind of sweetness to it but there is that really distracting mixed fruit kind of vibe, especially up in the top notes.  Tart overall, and in the back half of the exhale I get a good amount of warmness combined with a weird apple cider vinegar kind of funk like after you take a shot of the stuff (Just me? I had a hippy friend who swore by the stuff) and you just exhale that weird tart slightly fermented note.  Not really harsh, but sort off putting. Sweetness level is okay in general, but doesn't real pull it into a rum.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Uh, most of it. There's a weird fruitiness that I don't really associate with rum.  Doesn't really taste like any kind of rum, but I missing the spice or woody notes that I associate with dark rum.\n \n**Throat Hit:**  Not really? Warm exhale, just a bit odd overall but not really harsh.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Nah.  Not really. It's such a weird mish-mash of flavors that nothing is coming to mind.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, this is weak.  If you want to gaze headlong into the madness, you'll have to crank up the flavor. I initially mixed testers at 2 and 4% and they were damn near useless. Seems to be fairly linear, but there isn't much flavor at 4% and below. Cranking it up to 6% still not all that much flavor. 8% is starting to pick up a bit. It's still a bit thin and sour overall.  I don't really taste any rum here, or anything I'd actually want in rum, but what flavor is there is starting to show up. 10% is just more sour but it's getting a little dryer. 12% just tastes more like apple cider vinegar gum.  It's even starting to dry out a bit. I don't know, don't use this.  But if you're determined to, maybe start at 8% and work up.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[One review of substance on ELR by user \"NcMixes\" stating: \"Single mix @10% this is a shake and vape conc, the flavour doesnt change much if at all based on a 3 month steeped sample. This is quite a weak flavour, @ 10% im getting some spices and a weak taste of rum, no off flavours detected. Use at 4-7% in a mix and up to 15% standalone. Testing performed in lost art goon, dual coil 7 wrap ss 316l @ 0.26Ω 60w.\"](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/92769)\n\n[Here's the product page from TPA. Their take: \"Our newest rum might be the black sheep of the family. Sweet, spicy and with deep dark caramel notes, Dark Rum Flavor will have you joining the dark side. Great by itself or with a mixer.\"](https://shop.perfumersapprentice.com/p-8184-dark-rum-flavor.aspx)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

I thought it would be a very, very strong coffee almost to the point of being overpowering. However, like the curse of most coffee vape flavors, it doesn't really taste like coffee.

I have more than half of it left. This is by far the worst flavoring I've tried and it absolutely kills any recipe it is in. Unless you already have some, I would not recommend buying it. If there's anyone here who can actually make use of this flavoring, I am curious to know how because I find the chemical flavor so strong it's unbearable.\n",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** TPA Fruit Smoothie, 3% and 6%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 10 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Dense mouthfeel and tangy candy, not really a fruit smoothie in the traditional sense.\n\nThere's definitely something fruity in here.  Feels sort of waxy and artificial.  Tastes generically red with some cherry and strawberry, but occasionally I pick up a bit of banana and maybe kiwi.  Hard to pin down an exact flavor on this one.  Much more of a candy fruit flavor than anything realistic.  I do pick up some tarter notes, but it's coming across more like a generic candy tartness. Overall effect tastes a lot like an energy drink flavor, with that pixie stick kind of sweetness which sticks out a bit next to the waxiness of that fruit.\n\nI think the smoothie part of the refers mostly the texture.  Dense, thick mouthfeel that feels a bit separate from those fruitier notes.  I'm not picking up any dairy notes from the smoothie portion of this, and that volume itself feels pretty neutral.  That waxiness on the fruit also comes across in the vapor, and seems a bit sticky.  Kind of like vaping candy flavored lip gloss.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Candied fruit instead of anything like the actual fruit you'd use in a fruit smoothie. Nothing chemical or unpleasant though.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light.  That tartness can get a bit harsh but the volume here is crazy smooth.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 3% the fruit part of this just tastes generically sweet and tart. I'm picking up maybe something red tasting, but not much nuance or definition.  Texture is full and the mouthfeel is waxy.\n\nAt 6%, noticeably more sweet and tart.  Fruit is maybe a bit more defined and I'm getting a clearer cherry note.  Seems denser and thicker.  Still nothing that really reminds me of a fruit smoothie.\n\nJust based on these tests, I'd probably be using in candy vapes around 8% as a primary note.  There is a lot of body and texture here but not much actual flavor at lower percentages, so may be useful just for texture and tartness at 2-3%.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  For being called fruit smoothie, I don't really know how you'd make this taste non-artifical.  Would take additional fruits well with that texture, you'd just have to deal with that waxy candy sweetness.\n\nI'd use this more as a candy base.  If you crank up the flavor a bit with some more cherry, strawberry, or pomegranate you'd probably come out with something that felt a lot like a taffy vape.  I'd stay away from anything too floral, but should work well with most fruits you want to throw at it as a chewy candy base.\n\nThe more I vape this, the more it's starting to remind of something like Nerds.  I Think you could keep that neutral volume, and start throwing in more FW/TPA Sweet and Tart to really saturate this and turn into a a brighter, acidic candy vape that isn't too thin and harsh.\n\n**Second Opinions:** Nah, not that I've found.\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

It's not thick or dense, but almost a little \"sticky\" or \"viscous\" if that makes sense. I get little to no effervescence, which I was hoping would be present. Overall I enjoy the flavor, but it misses the mark to be an all inclusive ginger ale, so things like liquor, champagne, spices, etc. may be desired in a mix. Slightly sweet, not so much so that additional sweeteners would be unwarranted. Although the flavor is prominent, it is slightly in the back, so if you want it to be more present you may need to use a higher % in a mix.   \n\n**On the Nose**  \nMostly very sweet ginger, slight hint of spice\n\n**Recommended Usage**  \n*Stand alone*: 4-8%\n\n*In a mix*: 2-6%.  \n\n**Throat**  \nMild, very mildly effervescent feeling\n\n**Ideal Pairings**  \nCitrus, other spices, liquors/cocktails, menthol/cool, dark berries\n\n**Avoid**  \nI would think like melons probably.\n\n**Steep**  \nPretty Good right away. I don't notice much of a difference from 1 day - 2 week steep  \n\n**Recipe Idea: Spiked Ginger Ale**  \n*Steep:* S&V\n*Ratio: 20PG/80VG*  \n  \n* TFA Ginger Ale @ 4%  \n* (Insert Desired Liquor here at appropriate %) *FA Jamaican Rum @ 1.5%*  \n* TFA Champagne @ 3%  \n* TFA Koolada @ 0.75% (to taste)  \n\nSo here I think the Ginger Ale is definitely the star of the show, getting a little boost from your desired liquor and benefitting from the sort of \"watered-down\" effect from the champagne as well as a slightly more present illusion of effervescence. I like the Koolada to add \"ice\" to the drink which I feel is necessary. You should be able to use just about any liquor here that you like (bourbon, brandy, whiskey, etc.) and have good results; I went with Jamaican Rum since I wanted the ginger ale to be a little spicier and have that boozy tone to it. \n\n*Please if your opinion differs, or you have another review for this post it in the comments. Will help the master list with multiple reviews in one spot.*",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** TPA Gingerbread Extra Ginger, 3% and 6%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 25 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Gingerbread spice without any of the actual bakery.\n\nLeads with aggressive, spicy ginger.  Very true bakery ginger type flavor. Nothing really sweet or candied here.  I'd normally speculate wildly about the other spices in here, [but since it's TPA they have a list of the compounds used available](https://shop.perfumersapprentice.com/componentlist.aspx?sku_search=18025) and they list Clove Stem and Cassia (aka Liar's Cinnamon) Oils.  So the secondary spices are definitely clove and cinnamon.  The clove is pretty aggressive adds some numbing type mouthfeel.  I don't pick up much distinct cinnamon, but it's a bit hard to pick up much nuance through all that ginger and clove.  Cinnamon more just reinforces the clove and ginger.\n\nI don't pick up anything that actual feels like a gingerbread base, and again cheating with the component list, the only other ingredients are vanillin and benzyl alcohol.  The vanilla, and any fruit nuance are pretty much steamrolled by that heavy clove and ginger.\n\nI'm not a scientist or anything, but the clove stem oil and cassia oil are a little freaky to see listed out.  I'm not getting any really distinct separation in the bottle though [and the normal tpa gingerbread also has ginger, nutmeg, and cassia oil.](https://shop.perfumersapprentice.com/componentlist.aspx?sku_search=334401) So it's probably not a big deal?  I haven't seen this (or TPA Gingerbread) flagged anywhere for not being water-soluble.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  No actual bakery here.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Pretty intense, but it's ginger.  More of a spicy, heat type hit than a normal sting.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 3%, this is pretty intense.  Spicy ginger, and heavy almost anesthetic feeling clove. Not much cinnamon nuance.  No bakery in sight.\n\nAt 6% this is even more intense.  Ginger is unpleasantly spicy, and the clove is strong enough it pretty much mutes itself out after the 3rd drag.  Some more distinct cinnamon warm.  Also no bakery notes in here.\n\nJust based on these tests, I'd be using this at lower percentages as a spice accent. .5% should probably be enough for most applications but I'd top out at 1%.  Not as intense as something like FLV Clove, but working with a dilution would probably give you more control here.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This would definitely work to spice up your gingerbread.  Use with a less intense gingerbread like CAP or TPA Gingerbread Cookie for additional spice kick.  In the same vein, should work with a lot of holiday type spiced cakes or even a fruitcake.\n\nGood option for a pumpkin pie spice flavor that focuses a bit more on ginger than just a clove bomb.\n\nThe clove here makes this a poor choice for just a ginger accent. So I'd avoid using this anywhere where the clove or cinnamon is going to cause an issue.\n\nAnd hey, throw it in a tobacco.  Those dry spice notes should go pair well with non-aromatic tobaccos for some additional spicy depth.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  None that I can find.\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** TPA Grape Soda, 3% and 6%, others noted, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 17 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  An additive to make your grapes more soda-ish as opposed to a full grape soda concentrate.\n\nVery artificial grape base.  Flat, thick grape flavor without much vibrancy or juiciness. The grape here can came across as a bit syrupy, but it doesn't have the really intense candy grape flavor of something like LA grape.  Feels more like a dimetapp grape rather than grape crush on it's own.  Definitely on the purple side of things, I'd call it a concord grape but the implies that flavor occurs anywhere in nature.  Grape seems to be taking a back seat to more pronounced artificial soda type notes.  Sweet, but not a distressingly high percentage of sucralose sweet, or at least it carries it quite a bit differently than FW Grape Soda.\n\nThis is pretty intensely bitter.  At lower percentages against the sweetness of the grape, it feels a bit like an aspartame heavy diet grape soda.  At higher percentages, those grape notes are little bit more prominent, but the bitterness here gets medicinal.  Starts to pull even more towards that dimetapp profile.  Actually tastes a bit like leather polish smells.  Lower percentages do a decent job of emulating that weird overflavored bitterness in actual grape soda.  I'm not getting anything that feels particularly effervescent or fizzy here, but that bitterness does give grapes mixed with it some contrast and somehow makes them feel a bit more mouthwatering and juicy.\n\nBig competition here would probably be FW Grape Soda.  While sweet, this isn't as crazy sucralose heavy as the FW.  I do feel like the FW Grape Soda has a fuller soda flavor solo, and it's less bitter and medicinal.  FW Grape Soda, even with the truly impressive amount of sucralose, is probably a better solo grape soda flavor, but this may work as an accent if you wanted to build your own soda as opposed to FW just acting like a purple sweetener.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Solo, this has some fairly prominent bitter, medicinal notes.  Starts to pick up a leather polish chemical note at higher percentages.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light. Nothing really sticks out.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 3% the off notes here really stick out.  I'm getting dimetapp, basically, with an artificial grape flavor, heavy bitter notes, and almost astringent kind of mouthfeel on top of a syrupy body.\n\nIf 3% is dimetapp, then 6% is like someone took just the grape saturated active ingredients back out and served them.  Very bitter, with that weird leather goods taste.  Probably don't mix this at 6%.\n\nThinking I was maybe just over-flavoring with this, I started cutting the remainder of the testers.  At 1%, the off-flavors were significantly more manageable and actually resembled some of the slightly bitter artificial notes from grape soda. I feel like the grape here isn't a particularly deep flavor and it's taking a back seat to the more aggressive soda-esque or medicinal notes.  Works better, but still needs to be filled in.\n\nJust based on these tests, I'd be using this relatively low for a TPA flavor and just as an accent in a fuller grape soda vape.  I'd probably start at .5% and work up on top of a fuller grape base.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  More of a soda component than a full grape soda.  I'd use the distinctly soda notes as an accent and flesh them out quite a bit.  I'd probably lean toward a more candied full grape like LA Grape, INW Grapes, or a higher percentage of TPA Grape Juice.  If you wanted to go nuts, you could add some FW Pink Champagne for whatever passes for fizz in vaping and some additional brightness.\n\nOutside of a grape soda, this is too artificial for anything realistic, and the off notes are too intense to suggest over other grape flavors for grape candies.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  I'm not sure if this is a reformulated flavor.  There are mentions of TPA Grape Soda going back a couple of years, but the TPA spec list for it is still pending, which is usually a sign of a newer flavor.  These could very well refer back to an older version of this flavor, so YMMV.  I picked this up when it was added to Bull City Flavors within the last couple months.\n\n[A couple of notes on ELR.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/47317) User \"MeJuica\" writes: \"Tastes like crush grape soda really good has a fizz taste to it.\"  User \"Pedals4Coffee\" adds: \"This has a concord grape or florally taste. Grape juicy. the floral flavor has left to be replaced by more grape juice flavor over time. I don't taste soda.\"  Average mixing percentage is 5.6%, which doesn't really match up my testing here.\n\n[One review on Chef's.](https://www.chefsflavours.co.uk/perfumers-apprentice/5290-grape-candy.html)  User \"Craig C.\" writes: \"Cant go wrong with tfa - mixed 15% - 50/50 with tfa grape juice - excellent. Great mixed with salt water taffy too by flavour west.\"  Again, those percentages seem a bit suspect, at least based on the bottle I have.\n\n[And an another suggestion for a 50/50 mix with TPA Grape Juice, this time from a post on TPA Grape Juice from user \"magespooks.\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/3iqe9h/tfa_grape_juice_dear_god_moar/)  They suggest starting at 6% and working up.

Let me tell you something, how this flavor ever hit the market is beyond me.  Maybe it's a bad joke by TFA, or maybe it only works in a 10% dilution and 1 drop per 100 mL or something, but I'm not going to f around with all that.  I'm here to talk about this flavor at 3% without a dare, a free t-shirt, or a even a free spot on the DoD top 10 list.\n\n**Setup:** Velocity clone; dual twisted 24awg Ni/28awg kanthal @ .27Ω; cotton wicks; 50 W\n\n**Testing:** The Flavor Apprentice Honey @ 3%; Aged: 15 days\n\n**Flavor description:**  Dirty and burnt tasting, in the worst possible way something could be dirty, like burnt dirt.  Burnt rubber, like someone just did a burnout in my kitchen.  Melted plastic fumes that aren't safe to inhale.  Cardboard that your shitty nephew put in the toaster, started on fire, and sprayed with water to put the fire out, tripping the GFCI that was placed there by an electrician, who was mandated to do so by the government's electrical code because they know people tend to do stupid shit like that.  It also contains 0% of anything resembling honey at 3% in a 70/30 mix with 3mg/mL nic... Maybe my nic is bad? :S \n\n**Off-flavors:** See above.\n\n**Throat hit:** 2/10 pretty mellow on the throat, but I give it 10/10 in the nostrils after the exhale.\n\n**Uses:** I mixed it with some SC Red Apple and it tastes exactly like the description above with a hint of apple.  Even with TFA Absinthe, I get slight black licorice behind a wall of burnt dirtiness.  Is that my supper burning?  Haven't even started it yet, never mind.  This flavoring makes a great gift to someone who has 200+ flavors, but not this one.  A completed collection if you will.  I'm sure this could have many other uses, but in your ejuice probably isn't one of them.\n\n**Pairings:**  It pairs great with other random flavors I have, but can't really classify into their own bag.  The trash can might not be a bad place for this one, unless you know voodoo and can post a winner in the monthly thread sometime in the next year.  I plan on keeping this around for something, but I'm not sure what for quite yet.  I'm open to suggestions though.\n\n**Notes:**  I want to note that I had this steeping before I even saw skiddz' spectacular vertical YouTube video.  It makes the review a bit more relevant given this little piece of DIY history.\n\nPlease take this review as somewhat of a suggestion as to where to spend your next $2.  If you've been in DIY for a while and you can honestly say you've spent money on stupider shit, buy it and try it for fun.  If you're new to DIY, or even if you're not new but pretty happy with your experience so far, maybe skip this one.\n\n[Bonus video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4JXnpdAUig&feature=youtu.be) of /u/skiddlzninja trying it out.  \"It tastes like living in Ohio.\"\n\n[Link to all of our flavor reviews in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)\n\n**Side note:** If you're truly after a honey flavor, I hear FA makes a far more realistic one.\n",

It's not a spot on, realistic honeydew; more of a candy-like version. \n\n##**Developement:**##\n\nAt 2% it is thin, more fresh and watery. The background notes come to the front after a short steep.\n\nAt 5% you got yourself a really bold honeydew flavor. At =<5% it seems to hit the sweet spot, giving you a very clear flavor profile.\n\nAt 10% it started off very strong - the sweetness and the fruityness diminished almost completely, leaving you with some muted honeydew volatiles. \n\n##**Recommended Percentage and Steep:**##\n\nI would recommend 2-5% for standalone flavor and a short steep (overnight to 3 days).\n\n\n\n##**Toxicity**##\nVolatile | contains\n---|---\nAcetoin | \nDiacetyl |  \nAcetyl Propionyl|  \n\n##**Other:**##\nTFA has Honeydew and Honeydew II flavoring.

And a Crown Mini with a .25ohm SS coil at 40W.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**PG/VG:** 30/70\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Steep Time:** 2 Weeks\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Aroma:** Slightly perfumed vanilla, milk, sweetness, light spices maybe cinnamon and cardamom?\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Flavor Description:** Mildly sweet vanilla rice milk with a hint of cinnamon? This has a very authentic milky rice flavor with decent body. It's not as thick and creamy as whole milk or creamer, but similar to 2% milk and actually quite smooth. There's a medium strength natural vanilla that rides in the top notes enough to stay present throughout the entire vape. At first I thought this had more spices that I just couldn't distinguish, I was thinking nutmeg or cardamom. But the more I vape this, the cinnamon is a little different than I'm used to as well. It's doesn't taste the same as the commonly used cinnamon that is usually found in applesauce or mixed with sugar on toast, although that is there as well, but it's something more? I've never had Mexican cinnamon, but I'm wondering if this is it? Maybe if someone has had it and also tried this might be able to weigh in here? They have really done an excellent job with balance on this one. Even though cinnamon is a very pungent and dominant flavor, it's not too strong and doesn't bury the rice milk. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:** None\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit:** 5/10\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Pairings:** Cookies, cakes, cereal, creams, nuts, ice cream, butter, spices, tea, koolada, smoothies, shakes, peaches, mangos, other fruits that are good with cinnamon.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Notes:** I got this looking for a base to create rice pudding. I think this is going to work, but it's going to take a little finesse. Some are going to think this is a weak flavoring and I agree it is somewhat weak. When I first tried it I couldn't taste very much at all, just mild sweetness with a hint of spice. After 5 minutes of chain vaping, the flavor really developed quickly. And seemed to get better the more I vaped. I believe the heat of the sub ohm actually helped this one. Which leads me to believe it will get stronger with a longer steep. I will try to update at 4 weeks. I was surprised to find that I liked it as a single flavor ADV though, and enjoyed the break from \"in your face\" flavors. I may go up to 15% on the next one, but I am enjoying this as a SF. I have read on reviews and heard people say they like this as a single flavor at 20% as well. In a mix, I'm not really sure, but I'm going to guess at least 4-8% due to the weakness and mild flavor.",

    "markdown": "Knowing that anise and licorice are one of those lesser used - and also enjoyed flavors, u/isuamadog and yours truly set out sail to try a few of them and share our notes with you.\n\nThey might be useful to someone out there.\n\nHence, this is not classified as a flavor review, but more of guidelines.\n\nWe tested the following:\n\n* TFA Horehound\n* INW Lukrecja (INW Liquorice)\n* MB Anise Star\n* FA Anise\n* TFA Absinthe\n\n**Horehound**:\n\nWe started this at 1% and neither of us picked up a whole lot of flavor, other than some menthol - this was around 55w to 60w. Along the menthol, we detected weak notes of caramel some anise. The one that stood out was really the menthol.\n\nWe bumped it up to 1.5% and oh dear... The menthol packs a punch at that point and we started to detect more fruity notes here - sort of citrusy notes.\n\nIt's very light on the licorice, hence we can see this being used for many other things than just a licorice.\n\nu/isuamadog mentioned it could work well in a citrus soda as an example.\n\nSuggested starting point of this in a mix would be 0.25-0.5% and go from there.\n\nWe probably wouldn't pair this up against bakeries and tobaccos, but anything else it can definitely work with, as it does have many nuances to it.\n\nu/ediblemalfunction made a [Ricola style candy](http://alltheflavors.com/recipes/77359#alpine_drops_by_ediblemalfunction) using it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**INW Lukrecja (INW Liquorice)**:\n\nWe solo tested this at 1% and the flavor here surprised us.At first, it was SUPER weird - It's a typical case of you reading the label and expect a flavor, but you're getting something else. Typically, that's a bad thing, but in this case it was a very positive experience.\n\nThe flavor here has nothing to do with licorice - not in the sense of anise or salmiak at least. It does have tones of it, kinda like VT Fig, but the flavor for this one is almost a spot on spiced prune.\n\nIt does lack some throat hit and that spice is hard to detect what is - but it's there.\n\nThe spice comes with some smoked notes as well plus it has a very delightful round texture.\n\nu/isuamadog said and I quote: \"almost smoked, like you took a prune and toasted it on the grill\".\n\nWhat makes this one really unique is the almost jelly-ish body it has. It's sweet, but not sweet as a candy - natural sweetness would be the correct term.\n\nPairings for this would definitely be bakeries and tobaccos and definitely with other licorice flavors as well - such as FA Black Touch.\n\nCan also be used with darker fruits - but should probably be kept away from the more brighter fruits.\n\nIn a mix, this can probably be used anywhere from 0.25-1%.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**MB Anise Star**:\n\nStarted this at 1% and before we even tried it, we noticed it had a very weak smell.\n\nBased on that, we already from the begining bumped it up to 1.5%.\n\nNo licorice flavor this one at all. What we could detect was what the label says - Anise star spice. But also comes with extra added sweetness, that kinda made it a little weird.\n\nWe agreed, that this flavor is what FLV Root Beer is missing.\n\nAfter that, we found our big boy pants and bumped it up to 3% just to see what would happen.\n\nSurprisingly little actually. Not much changed in the flavor, with the exception that a minor of the sweetness went away and the anise appeared a little brighter. Although, the anise was also accompanied by a terrible off-note of a metallic taste which was not pleasant at all.\n\nThat combined gives you a super weird after-taste, that doesn't really sit well with anything.\n\nPairings for this would again be beverages or teas. There are nothing about this flavor that we can see being used for anything but those.\n\nKeep it low in a mix - 0.25-0.5%.\n\nThis was by far our least likeable of the tests we did.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**FA Anise**:\n\nStarting off at 1% as per usual by now.\n\nThe smell of this - ooooh snap, it's delicious! It's a straight up anise as promised, but it also comes with an incredible good tasting under-note that almost has a \"saltiness\" to it.\n\nEven at 1%, this packs a punch of flavor - so the category here is your typical FA flavor that works brilliant in lower percentages.\n\nThe notes in this are sharp and adds edge, but not in an uncomfortable way. This would have the ability to bend a mix and make it different.\n\nIt's rich and full in flavor, but it also stops in flavor quickly - meaning, the flavor is there and the next second, it gone again. This is one of those flavors that could work very well with CAP Licorice, as it does add what the CAP Licorice tend to be missing to make it a pure full licorice.\n\nThe background notes it comes with is very similiar to those notes you'd find in your typical Scandinavian licorice candy, which is very good.\n\nSweet, salty and full - in that order. And it brings that very delicious \"zing\" that makes flavors really pop.\n\nParings for this one is a bit of a broad term. It can work very well in candies, but also in spiced and floral mixes, beverages, tobaccos - maybe not so much in bakeries, but I'm sure someone will make that work too. All around, we can almost see this work with anything - except bright fruits, no!\n\nIn a mix it's a 0.3-0.5% type - higher than that and it would take over and bully anything you'd pair it with.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TFA Absinthe**:\n\nWe'll be honest with you. This one terrified us before we even started, but none the less; big boy pants out and on and we hit it straight off at 5%.\n\nTo start out, the smell of this is straight up absinthe - no more, no less.Taste-wise, we have probably never come across a single flavor that had this many nuances as TFA Absinthe does. One moment it's sweet, the next it gets weird and finally it bitter and delicious. All three stages lingers in your mouth at the same time at the end.\n\nWeird taste, but so seriously delicious.\n\nAs many other salmiak based (and I do believe this is salmiak based, not anise), TFA Absinthe comes with a tongue-numbing \"zing\" to it. Some like it, some don't. For u/isuamadog and I it's a win.\n\nThe sweetness this flavor comes with is very welcoming and it does blend in well with the salmiak the licorice in it comes with.\n\nParings for this one would be booze, as it does lack the boozy vibe to it. Maybe some whiskey or gin - whatever booze floats your boat and does it for you.\n\nThere are a good amount of recipes on ATF for this one, ranging everywhere from candy to beverages, hell even a fruit mixture as well.\n\nIn a mix, this would probably do its best around 2-3%.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat was pretty much what we had for you. We apologize, that we didn't add in the hardware used, but there were two of us after all. We do hope, that someone will find this information useful, should they want to jump into a darker rabbit hole.\n\n[**DIY\\_eJuice Flavor Reviews**](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** TPA Huckleberry@ .5%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 20 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Cherries, raspberries, benzene, and playdough.  A sweet, jammy red fruit body buried under a bunch of weirdness from off notes.  Super strong, but not strong in the same way as something like blackberry where you're fighting a floral note the entire time. This has some lighter floral character, but I think the llmiting factor in a mix is going to be the weirdness off that cherry right up front and the phenol edge on the back end.\n\nInhale has some good, deeper red berry flavor.  Hard to pick anything out in particular, but I definitely get some deeper cherry and raspberry in there.  Moderately dense, with a pretty heavy sweetness. Inhale actually is quite a bit more pleasant than the exhale. Exhale is all dense artificial cherry up front.  Suffers from a pretty solid hit of that weird benzene, plastic off-gassing off note. Some tannic, grassy top notes pushing towards raspberry or a green strawberry.  Not overwhelmingly floral at a low percentage, but it's really exaggerated by all the weirdness from that cherry note.  Still a solid sweetness here, somewhere between syrupy and jammy.  Definite sugar lips, but between that plastic and the grassy notes, the lingering effect is something like that phenolic playdough note that shows up in Cap Glazed Donut.\n\n**Off Flavors:** Quite a bit. It's an odd flavor. There's the cheap plastic off-gas note from the cherry in this along with some perfume and a bit of that weird phenolic playdough note.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Moderate, all from those off-notes.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:** Eh... use at your own peril basically.  I really do think there is a good jammy red berry sweetness in here, but those off notes are killer. Maybe use this at .25% as a backup from a primary Raspberry or Cherry when you want some thicker body.  A dilution might be the key here. I don't see a ton of use for this as a primary note in a mix.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nS&V concentration testing, this is definitely in the sub 1% range. At .25%, I'm getting some jammy, sweet red berry body and the off-notes, while present, are decently under control. At .5%, I'm getting a strong fake cherry plastic off-note. Good body underneath it, but even at .5% I find it pretty distracting. At 1% that phenol playdough thing is coming to the forefront and the concentrate is getting really floral. \n\n[TPA warns us on their website: \"This is a very strong, fruity flavor. Be warned: some people absolutely love it, and some hate it!!\" and they seem to be dead on.](https://shop.perfumersapprentice.com/p-7254-huckleberry-flavor.aspx) It's strong, and fairly weird. Personally a pass for me, but keep it low if you do use it.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Vintage ECF post on this tasting pretty heavy on perfume and soap.

It's got an exotic flavor to it; almost reminds me of something you might find in the same family as a cherimoya, or a more exotic melon like papaya.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** TPA Kalua and Cream @ 1%,3%, 5%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 14 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  A thick, heavy kalua and cream for about 5 seconds before it starts to gunk and burn.  I was happy, and then I was sad. Blacker than sin in the bottle, this is 100% going to destroy your wicks.  It's a pretty decent flavor overall, but 3% seems to be the tipping point where it gets really weird and starts to burn.  Should be mostly useful as a thick accent for coffee vapes, but really keep it at 2% and under.\n\nTested at 1%, inhale has some higher sweet kalua mellow coffee top notes, with a denser cream base.  A bit light and heavily sweet, but balanced overall. Exhale is largely the same, with those coffee notes coming out more clearly.  I still think there may be a bit of gunking, because I'm getting a scarily accurate roasted coffee top note. Heavy whipped cream base, with a buttery exhale. Pretty sweet overall, with a dense, rich mouthfeel. Lingering slightly bitter coffee notes and a buttery mouthfeel.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  The flavor here is actually pretty good. The cream portion of this has a sort of heavier, almost buttery whipped cream taste to it instead of a straight cream.  There is the entire burned/gunked thing at 3% and up though.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Nah, fam.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  The utility of this concentrate is hampered by whatever the hell is going on here with the gunking. Personally, I'd never let this get near a tank.  Anything over 2% and you'll be rewicking every 10 minutes if you don't want to pink up a flat, muted, and slightly burnt gunky coil taste.\n\nUsed at a lower percentage, this has some good volume and a nice heavy, almost whipped cream and a lighter, sweet coffee liqueur taste. I can't get a strong enough flavor without gunking to really recommend it as a primary note, but it should work okay as backup in coffee vapes with a cream component, just for some added thickness and richness.\n  \n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, the limiting factor is definitely when this concentrates starts to taste gunky and burns. With my steeped samples, I'm getting a clear gunk taste at 3%, so I'd keep it under that. S&V tasting, this isn't a super concentrated flavor. It's weak in flavor at .25 and .5%. 1% has a subtle coffee sweetness, and a thicker mouthfeel. 2% doesn't immediately jump out as burning, and really pushes that thick, buttery whip cream. At 3%, I get about 3 drags before I start to taste that gunk.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Post from user \"prokreat\" declaring \"YUK!\" No note of percentage used, but since it's 2 years ago I'm guessing it was fairly high.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/32kacb/tfa_kahluacream_yuk_back_to_drawing_board/)\n\n[On ELR, user \"Ghettotrout\" nails it: \"Such a bummer.

It doesn't.  It tastes more like sugar with a slight hint of alcohol that fades out after a few days, with the remaining flavor being comparable to the scent of a night club at 10 o'clock the next morning:  stale beer and spilled drinks.  Having been in these places the morning after, this flavor brings out a feeling of nostalgia I never realized I possessed until now.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Not bourbon.  Sugary taste, and stale spilled drinks on carpet.  See above.\n\n**Throat hit:** very slight. Maybe 2/10\n\n**Uses:**  ~~You can probably skip this one unless you're looking for a light sweetener that tastes like the bottom of a glass of vodka and sprite long after the ice has melted.~~  I have not played around with this flavor enough to find a use for it, however [Drunken Pears](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/4dcjoj/drunken_pears_v_20/) by /u/matthewkocanda and [Bangin Bourbon Bread](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/3o809o/new_autumn_adv_bangin_bourbon_bread/) by /u/skiddlzninja are 2 fairly popular recipes here where I have seen it put to good use.\n\n**Pairings:** Maybe some fruits if you want to give them a dirty fermented effect, ~~otherwise the trash can or \"remove from cart\" button on your next order.~~  I paired it with 4% FA Torrone, and it was OK.  I would assume tobaccos would go well with it as well.  I will continue to play with it and report back if I find other decent pairings.\n\n**Notes:** Maybe I need to try a different percentage, but this flavor seems too sweet to be considered \"Kentucky Bourbon.\"  I'm an avid drinker of all types of whiskey, and this doesn't resemble the taste of whiskey by a long shot. \n\n**Rating:** ~~0/5 stars.  Sorry TFA, this flavor was a huge let down to me judging strictly on taste vs product description.  I can only hope FA Whiskey does a better job on resembling whiskey.~~\n\nEDIT:too\n\nEDIT 2:  I apologize for the rather \"bitchy\" rating.  I have since stopped rating flavors with stars.  I understand taste is very subjective, and I hope someone adds a better review in the comments.  I did mix this with some of my standalone FA Torrone today, and was rather impressed.  I see that it has it's place in a recipe, and is not meant to replicate whiskey 1:1.",

Pretty close to what an actual key lime tastes like.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Nothing but limes here\n\n**Throat hit:**  10/10 very sharp on the throat by itself.\n\n**Uses:**  Great as an accent (0.5-1%) to other citrus fruits and some berries or top note (2-4%) if you really like limes. \n\n**Pairings:**  Pair 2:1 or 3:1 with FA Lime Tahiti (I use cold pressed) to create a more rounded lime.  Thick creams like Bavarian, Cheesecake, or a little Marshmallow are going to help take the sharpness away from this flavor as well.  Also works well with citrus fruits, strawberries, and sometimes coconut if you do it right.\n\n**Notes:**   Not a very desirable standalone due to it's harshness.  When using this flavor in a recipe, steeping is going to be very beneficial.  Shake and vape with this flavoring is going to be pretty rough on your throat and is not recommended unless you're a bit of a masochist.  ;)\n\nEDIT: [Link to all of our flavor reviews in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)",

Not a lot of milk taste if you will, but definitely thick in the mouth and dark tasting.  At 3% it comes off as a bit dry, almost chalky, like a Whopper candy but without the chocolate coating and tastes slightly reminiscent of Kahlua liquor.\n\n**Off-flavors:** The alcohol note along with the apparent lack of actual milkiness.  Some people report a sickly sour note which I suppose could be attributed to the fact that it is a dairy flavor, or maybe it was used at too high of a %.\n\n**Throat hit:** 2/10 Pretty smooth\n\n**Uses:**  0.25-1.5% is probably going to be an acceptable range for this flavor to add thickness/mouthfeel, though I would definitely start low and work up as preferred.  Much above that and it gets rather funky and can easily over-power and mute other flavorings.\n\n**Pairings:**  Use with TFA Dairy Milk in a cereal milk base.  Would also go well with other creams, nut/grain/cereal or AP, vanilla, caramel, chocolate, custard, maybe cookie, or even cinnamon.  Berries would also be a decent pairing, but it may be tricky to nail down the percentages as to not mute them.\n\n**Notes:** Not a standalone for me.  This flavor is proving to be rather tricky to use and is going to be more of a small % additive as it is rather over-bearing and funky.  This concentrate also has a very subjective taste and may not be enjoyable to everyone.\n\nFlavor available at BCV [here](http://www.bullcityflavors.com/malted-milk-tfa/) \n\n[Link to e-liquid-recipes notes on this flavor](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/2374)\n\n[Link to all of our flavor reviews in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)",

Becomes similar to a mango puree after a week steep, more of a soft/mellow mango flavor as compared to the brightness/juiciness of a ripe mango. After two weeks it tastes much closer to a ripe and juicy mango but it still has a bit of that 'puree' element to it, with a dash of brightness that makes it more fresh fruit like.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Starts off tasting like a mango puree or artificial juice, mostly fades out by two weeks.\n\n**Throat hit:** Most noticeable at the end, I give it 4 or 5 out of 10. I may have have over-nic'd it (oops). \n\n**Uses:** Good in a tropical mix, or could do well as a base in a melon vape because of that thicker 'puree' quality.\n\n**Pairings:** Tropical fruits, other melons, maybe creams.\n\n**Notes:** So far I've been most successful using it in a Monster Melon's clone, and it does a very nice of providing a mango flavor throughout the entire vape.

Power at 80 Watts  \n\n**Testing:** TFA Oatmeal Cookie @ 5%, 70/30 VG/PG, Steeped: 1 week  \n\n**Flavor Description:** This flavor is a dry, slightly sweet grainy cookie. I don't get much oatmeal but rather a grainy texture. It has a slightly nutty exhale and aftertaste. The cookie flavor is reminiscent of a crunchy rather than soft baked cookie.  \n\n**Off Flavors:** I almost get a bit of soured milk flavor from this. It isn't terribly off putting just not exactly what you want in a cookie.  I think it might be an attempt at butter.\n\n**Throat Hit:** 4\\10. The first few puffs of this flavor is a little stingy in the throat but calms down once you've been vaping for a bit.  \n\n**Uses:** You could definitely turn this into a decent oatmeal cookie if you add to the oatmeal layer. Maybe with ooo Oatmeal or flv oatmeal raisin. It has that dry crunchy feature you look for in oatmeal cookies. This would also make a good base for a peanut butter cookie as it has that nutty taste to it. This might also be good to add like a crumble on apple cobblers or parfaits at a lower percentage.  \n\n**Pairings:** This would be good with fa maple or caramel. Basically any fruit you like with oatmeal would go good with this flavor as well. I can see custards and creams pairing nicely with this flavor too to moisten it up. Sugar cookie would work nice to sweeten this flavor and turn it into a softer cookie.  \n\n**Notes:** I can see where TFA was trying to go with this flavor. Although it doesn't have a lot of oatmeal flavor you get the impression of oatmeal with the graininess and nuttiness of this cookie. I think with a little bit of help, this could really be a great flavor.  \n\n**Second Opinions:**  [Not many people on elr get an oatmeal flavor either](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/23866)  \n[ spaceghost_n_moltar found the flavor to be cinnamon-y and cakey and used it in their muffin man clone](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/49rk5j/the_final_results_of_my_quest_to_clone_muffin_man/)  \n[cswindz found it to be disapointing when trying to use it in their oatmeal ice cream recipe](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/4bi41c/oatmeal_oatmeal_oatmeal/)  \n\n##[Other flavor reviews on the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)\n\n\n\n",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** TPA Passion Orange Guava, 3% and 6%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 15 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Floral and slightly tropical fruit blend.  Doesn't really read as a single flavor POG vape.\n\nCould be the power of suggestion, but the fruit here seems fairly layered.  I get some tarter passion fruit first.  Seems like more of tart accent than full passion fruit flavor.  The passion fruit here seems thin, harsh and floral.  I do get some deeper orange juice base.  Top notes have some orange juice vibrancy but the base feels a bit flat without the acidity and fullness of an actual fruit juice.  Base feels a bit more artificial than realistic, with some candy orange notes.  Sweet guava finish.  Probably the best executed part of the trio, with a guava nectar type flavor and a syrupy sweetness.  The floral notes from the passionfruit comes back around on the tail end of the vape though, and those bitter floral notes stand out.\n\nTexture-wise, this doesn't really hit that POG profile.  There is a some juiciness from the orange and guava in the base, but the passion fruit feels sharp and thin on top.  This is pretty solidly harsh and sort of clashes with the moderate juiciness in the base.  Sweetness level is okay for a POG profile, but it's more a white sugar artificial sweetness without more realistic and full fruit sweetness.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Aggressive floral top notes.  Top end of this flavor is thin and harsh.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Harsh.  I get a pretty solid throat hit out of this.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 3% this seems fairly thin.  That passion fruit is in full effect, but lacking the heavier body from the orange and guava.  A bit undersweet actually, and seems pretty harsh.\n\nAt 6% this is fuller and sweeter.  Guava is starting to taste a bit artificial and the orange is fairly flat and candied. Passion fruit florals are coming across as bitter and still prominent.  The bit of heavier base does make this seem a bit less harsh.\n\nJust based on these tests, I'd probably be using this as a lighter accent around 2-3%, primarily for the passion fruit and guava.  Orange gets too candied at higher percentages for a primary flavor if you're going after actual fruit.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  With passion fruit, orange, and guava this was probably intended as more of a single flavor POG style one-shot.  It doesn't really hit that profile for me, and I'm not quite sure what you'd do to \"fix\" it.  Some of the body issues could be addressed by using a small percentage of a banana cream, although the individual fruit flavors here aren't really robust enough to stand up to an aggressive banana flavor.  Alternatively you could try thickening up the orange component with a orange juice style concentrate like FA Royal Orange... which would then throw off the balance and you'd have to add up a backup guava and probably more passion fruit.  Probably easier to skip this rather than try to build a POG off of it.\n\nKind of floral to use as a main note in a fruit mix.  Would probably work as a tart accent with a juicier fruit like CAP Golden Pineapple.\n\n**Second Opinions:** Nah, not that I've found.\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

The only profile missing is that slight tang a pineapple has, otherwise it is fairly realistic. Unfortunately (or fortunately, depending on what you're going for I guess) this is not the profile that sticks around. After an overnight steep it changes into a pineapple juice, like someone took that realistic pineapple and squeezed the juice out of it till all that was left of it was the lifeless, shriveled husk of possibility and a glass of pineapple juice. After a further steep it loses more of its bright and juicy aspects and fades into a sweet candied pineapple, either a literal pineapple candy or a dry pineapple covered in some sugar; it is NOT a particularly bright, juicy, tangy/sharp, realistic pineapple. \n\n**Off-flavors:** None at around 6%, I could imagine some weird sharp or almost sickly sweet if its pushed too high though. Edit: As many people have mentioned in the comments, some get an almost 'battery-acid' like note if used at too high a percent. This battery acid note can also make the vape very harsh.\n\n**Throat hit:** None, 0/10 - it is smooth and has a similar 'wet' effect as INW Cactus. \n\n**Uses:** Despite my ragging on it, I do think this flavor is usable both as a standalone and in a mix. As a standalone it can be used for a sweet, almost candy pineapple flavor and it can used in fruit recipes to add in brightness or make it juicier. Great for giving a slight tropical note to fruit mixes as well.\n\n**Pairings:** Fruits is obvious, I think it might also work with creams. Can't really see it with any bakeries or custards though.\n\n**Closing Thoughts:** Even though I ragged on this flavor for the way it changes from realistic to candied I actually really like it. It can help lift certain fruit notes up or add in some natural sweetness (that isn't a strawberry) into a mix, and just tastes pretty damn good in general. Overall I would give it a 7/10. Its been a while since I've done one of these, so please let me know if there's anything I can do differently for future reviews!\n\n**Bonus Recipe:** So I'm gonna be a jackass and plug my own recipe, [Pearadise](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/5757#pearadise_by_wafflepriest1).\n\nIngredient | % \n:--| --:\nTPA Pineapple |  3\nTPA Pear | 6\nTPA Dragonfruit | 4\nTPA Coconut Extra | 0.5\n\nReally hope I didn't fuck up the table, and if you mix it up I hope you enjoy.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** TPA Pineapple (Juicy), 3% and 6%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 8 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  A juicy pineapple marshmallow?\n\nTart, but still candied, pineapple flavor.  Tarter top notes have some acidity and freshness and skew closer to realistic.  The body of the flavor leans a bit more towards candied, with a white gummy bear type sweetness and saturation.  Very light savory, almost sulfur note to the pineapple but it's subtle and no worse than INW Pineapple which doesn't really show up in mixes.\n\nThis is somehow both dry and juicy at the same time, especially at higher percentages.  Inhale actually has some juicy pineapple up top, but there's a slightly dry, almost fluffy volume to the mouthfeel.  Juiciness sticks around for the beginning of the exhale but that fluffiness takes over on the back end.  I also pick up some vanilla here, especially after that juicier pineapple fades out.   Comes across a bit like a marshmallow, or like it's premixed with TPA Vanilla Swirl. Overall effect is an odd juxtaposition of texture.\n\nComparing this to some of the other widely used pineapple flavors, this isn't as juicy as CAP golden pineapple for me, but it does fresher even with those candied notes.  Less realistic than INW pineapple but more saturated and full.  Comparing it to the standard TPA Pineapple, it's more candied and sweeter and while this has some tartness to it, it doesn't have the tropical battery acid thing going on that the standard one does.  Does seem noticeably less harsh, but that vanilla and fluffiness is different.  Solo TPA pineapple has a bit of butryic note (that usually doesn't show up steeped) that I'm not getting off the juicy pineapple.  Sulfury pineapple note is basically neglible in all of this these.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Almost marshmallow like fluffy texture.  Decent amount of vanilla in here as well.  Very light sulfur note.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light to moderate.  Still a bit of bite but nothing as aggressive as TPA Pineapple.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 3% this has a softer pineapple flavor. Not really saturated, with a light tartness, and a decent juiciness. Some of that fluffy texture with a lighter vanilla accent.  Fairly smooth overall, without much harshness.\n\nAt 6% I'm getting a more prominent vanilla and a noticeably fluffier texture.  Actual pineapple is a bit brighter and more candied. Feels juicier at the beginning but drier at the end. Pineapple hits quite a bit harder here but I wouldn't call it harsh.\n\nJust based on these tests, I'd keep this low as an accent for some tart, non-descript juiciness at around 2%.  You aren't going to get a clear pineapple, but you also won't run into that fluffy body nearly as hard.  As a primary flavor, and in an application where you don't mind the body, I'd go higher around 5-7%.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  The preferred application for this is something that works with both the pineapple, and that marshmallow-ish body.  Good fit pineapple candies that need some texture.\n\nOutside of a pineapple forward-candy, use an accent behind other fruits to juice up and slightly texturize mixes.\n\nSeems a bit too candied and artificial for something like a pineapple bakery.  I think it'd mix well with creams, but isn't going to taste like an actual pineapple is in there.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  [The ELR page here is less than helpful.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/78592)  Whole bunch of pairing lists and \"Odins Wrath\" declares it \"Not Bad.\"\n\n[Some product reviews up on DIY Ejuice.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** TPA Popcorn (Movie Theater), 3% and 6%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 23 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Sweeter air popped popcorn with a slightly fruity, waxy, and slightly butyric glaze.\n\nThere's a pretty solid popcorn note in here. Light and dry, tastes a lot like freshly popped popcorn smells.  Not a ton of texture, and I'm not picking up anything like an acetyl pyrazine type of crunch.  The popcorn base here feels more like air-popped popcorn, rather than slightly denser and thicker movie theater style.  I think the dryness of the popcorn base is pretty accurate, but nothing that tastes salty.\n\nI don't get much butter out of this though.  There's something heavier than just the straight popcorn, but it feels more waxy than rich and buttery. There is also something butyric in here. It's not full on vomity, but theres some of that kind of rancidity, especially on the back half of the exhale. I also get some fairly prominent sweet coconut in here with a bit of generic fruitiness.  This tastes a lot like an attempt at a diketone free attempt at an actual buttered popcorn flavor, [and the TPA spec sheet seems bears that out.](https://shop.perfumersapprentice.com/componentlist.aspx?sku_search=17698)  I also get some distracting sweetness out of this. Maybe a kettle corn level of sweetness, which isn't really a movie theater style popcorn thing.\n\nThe only other popcorn flavor I've tried is FLV Popcorn.  I feel like that has a richer dairy note to the butter, but the base level of crunch is fairly similar.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Sweet coconut glaze flavor that doesn't really fit with the profile. Butryic, slightly rancid take on butter.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light.  Popcorn here is a bit dry, but nothing overly harsh.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 3%, I'm getting some dry popcorn top notes without much texture and a fairly strong coconut flavor. That butyric note is still present in the top notes, but could maybe pass as something richer if you squint just right.\n\nAt 6% there is more popcorn flavor, but still not much texture. Coconut feels a bit waxy, and that butryic note is getting pretty intense.\n\nJust based on these tests, I'd probably use this around 2% as a sweet popcorn accent.  For a primary flavor I'd be around 5%, but the popcorn in here is fairly delicate and isn't going to stand up to much.  I'd also steep extensively.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Probably workable in sweeter popcorn profiles, but I'd let this steep for a relatively long time to let those butyric notes settle down and thicken up to something a bit richer.  Crunch could be brought up a bit more with some AP.\n\nI'd stick to profiles like kettle corn, popcorn balls, or maybe even a cracker jack with some heavier, nuttier flavors and extra caramel.  I don't think this brings enough corn to try to bend into any kind of cornbread or corn muffin note.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  This has apparently been around for years but I can't find much solid info besides people in 2012 saying that mixed it at 15%.\n\n[Exactly one note on ELR.

It's got that really soft pear sweetness, and a bit of brightness that you'd expect from an apple to really bring it to the front. Because of this, it sweetens a fruity profile wonderfully. This concentrate is VERY strong, very noticeable even when used at 0.25%. It can also easily overtake a mix, so you'll typically want to use a light touch when mixing with it. \n\n**On the Nose**  \nSmells like Quince.

I get some prune notes from it off the top instead of raisin. It's more if the muskiness of a prune than the sweetness of a raisin. On the back end there is a kind of sweet anise candy thing going on. Very much hitting the black licorice candy button. \n\n**Off flavors:** Anise? That sweet anise candy thing that's going on? It's not unpleasant, it's just not supposed to be here. \n\n**Throat hit:** None at all really at this percentage. It's very smooth. \n\n**Pairings:** This may do really well as an element in a cocktail that needs that anise note. I could see this adding a much needed layer to whiskey or dark rum concentrates. It might also be what you're looking for if you are looking for a weak black licorice note. I did some quick recipes with different tobaccos and it pairs very well with the Inawera For Pipe Concentrates. It's not very up front it just gives a bit more complexity to the tobacco at 1.5%.\n\n**Quick recipe:**\nDank Bowl\n- INW Black for Pipe 2.5%\n- TFA Raisin 1.5%\n- FA Caramel .75%\n\n**Conclusion:** I eat raisins at least once a week and this is not them. It will however be useful to layer into tobaccos, booze and darker fruits to get more complexity and that \"certain something\". I like what it brings to darker tobaccos a lot. BTW when I ordered all I could get was a 30ml =D. If a couple of other flavor reviewers would like a little so we can get some decent second opinions please message me and we'll see about getting you some to test. \n\n**Second opinions:**There's not a lot out there.\n\n- ELR - [57Ghia notes] (http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/1731) \"Prune/Plum w/a Grape Candy Aftertaste\", others with the same notes confirming that low percentages work well with tobaccos. \n\n- ECX reviews - [one review] (http://www.ecigexpress.com/shop/diy-e-liquid/diy-e-liquid-flavors/signature-flavors/signature-sweet-flavors/raisin-flavor-signature.html) from fishdude that notes \"Not sure this flavor tastes like raisin exactly, but id does approximate it. It was fruitier than I expected based on the smell. I think it could really work well as a complementary note in tobacco mixes. I had read that this flavor is really strong, so I diluted 1 parts Raisin to 2 parts PG (or vg). I used the diluted raisn mix at a couple drops per 10 mL in a pipe tobacco recipe using ECX's Captain with a little Black Mile and Signature French Vanilla. Its like huffing a freshly opened bag of vanilla cavendish.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** TPA Ruby Chocolate, 3% and 6%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 20 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Semi-sweet and dry chocolate with a slightly juicy raspberry fruitiness.\n\n[TPA calls this a \"A smooth chocolate taste with bursts of yummy fruitiness. Similar to the taste of those candy chocolate cherries.\"](https://shop.perfumersapprentice.com/p-8541-ruby-chocolate-flavor.aspx)  \n\nThis delivers on some of that fruitiness.  Actual fruit flavor in here tastes kind of close to Acai, but that may just be flavor association from the proximity to chocolate.  Indistinct berry fruitiness, I'd call it closer to raspberry than cherry but it's a bit difficult to nail down.  Tastes a bit vague but fairly realistic.  Not a heavier solid candy type flavor.  Lightly tart but nothing intense enough to come across as sour or as clashing with the chocolate.  Some moderate juiciness and vibrancy. Fruit feels like an accent here, sort of sitting in the base of the flavor, while the top seems more chocolatey.\n\nI get quite a bit of cocoa out of this.  Drier, semi-sweet type of chocolate flavor.  Nothing off about the chocolate, but it doesn't really have the creamy depth of a milk chocolate. Seems a bit dry but it doesn't do the tootsie roll thing that TPA Double Chocolate Clear does. Feels like a slightly less dark version of HS Australian Chocolate, more of a cocoa rather than a full chocolate.\n\n[So, ruby chocolate is apparently a thing (kind of awesome breakdown, btw).](https://thechocolatejournalist.com/ruby-chocolate/)  Based on the descriptions, it's basically pink and lightly fruity white chocolate without much of an actual cocoa taste.  Based on that description, I'd guess this is substantially off-profile.\n\nMandatory coil gore report is mostly positive.  Doesn't seem any harder on wicks than TPA Double Chocolate Clear. Starts to taste a bit flat and muted after a couple ml, but I haven't gotten anything that tastes like straight burnt chocolate solids.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  So, apparently not like actual ruby chocolate. Nothing really unpleasant though. Not a tootsie roll or bandaid type chocolate flavor.  Could use some more creaminess for a full chocolate.\n\n**Throat Hit:** I'm not getting anything harsh.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 3%, feels a lot like cocoa dusted raspberries. No real richness to the cocoa notes.  Solid tartness to the fruit underneath that cocoa. Mouthfeel is a little thin.\n\nAt 6% I'm getting more chocolate.  Still distinctly fruity but that chocolate fills in a bit and comes closer to actual chocolate.  Still needs some help to have the depth of an actual chocolate.  Still nothing off or really unpleasant.\n\nJust based on these tests, I'd probably use this around 6-8% as a primary note in a mix where that chocolate is going to be filled in.  I'd use around 2% as a lighter cocoa accent in a fruity profile.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Good base for flavors that need both berries and chocolate.  I don't think you'll be able to mix around either component and just use one.\n\nCherry cordials would work here, or a fruitier truffle type flavor.  Would probably need some supporting cream to add some depth and richness to the chocolate base. Alternatively would work well with some AP to make that chocolate a bit more solid and hit harder.\n\nAs is, would work well in an ice cream or maybe some specialty bakery profiles.\n\nGood backup flavor for FLV Acai to boost the cocoa notes already there.\n\n**Second Opinions:** None that I can find.\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

    "markdown": "hi. New year's resolution is to do more flavor reviews in a more manageable way. But why on earth would I undertake a review of a DISCONTINUED flavor?!? Well, it saddens me to see 882 recipes get flushed down the drain on atf alone. And let's not forget Cardinal! So, I intend to review a whole gang of Ry4's to get an idea of what makes this profile click so we can remixxx a suitable version of HHG for those who care for these things and because, idk... I guess I want to.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCheck out the beginnings of this project  [in this Tuesday Tutorial Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/ei3ysx/tuesday_tutorial_holy_holy_grail_ry4_remixxx/).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOtherwise, let's move on!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n  \n\n# TPA RY4x2\n\n**Set up**: Asmodus c4, 0.43 Ohms, fused clapton ss316l avs wire  at 47 watts.\n\n**Testing**: Mixed at 5%. Steep time, 22 days\n\n**Profile**: Ry4 tobacco - caramel with hints of vanilla and tobacco.\n\n**Description**: I get why people call this a ‘dirty’ caramel. At 5% it really isn’t much caramel and barely any tobacco for my tastes. I’m thinking it’s just those people who think tobacco = bad/filthy. Whatever the issue, it has a slight hint of nondescript tobacco that’s promptly covered by a semi sweet caramel. There’s a bit of familiar sweet finish maybe just the caramel, maybe a bit of sweetener but it takes a while to get there. Really no creaminess to this at all, but there’s still some mouthfeel from the tobacco and the caramel together I suspect since it kind of fades to sweet. The tobacco notes pull the caramel down into that ‘dirty’ realm and you would need more caramel to pull it back up. There may even be a hint of a sour off note in there from the caramel almost more reminiscent of a butterscotch. I’m curious if that becomes more or less pronounced as we take it up a notch in percents as 5% is kind of more the bottom range of motion here.\n\nI really do not get any brown sugar or excessive sweetness. In fact at 5% it really isn’t very excessive in any distinguishable way.\n\n**Off notes**: A slight butterscotchish-ish off note that lingers like butterscotch ripple sometimes does to me if it isn’t balanced right with something else.\n\n**Suggested percents**: 0-3% for really just a hint, 4-6 for mid range and 7+ for more full flavor/primary note. \n\n**Uses**: Obviously well used flavor, familiar to most people. Obsidian pretty widely known recipe but also 3000+ other recipes on atf. This can be used anywhere you have a desire/need for caramel. At 1-3% i can see it blending in, 4-6 standing up in sweeter/dessert tobaccos, bakeries, etc., could probably do the same for creams/custards in the 4+ range. The tobacco portion of this is really more of a base note of dark even at 5% so I think it would barely show up in a mix at much lower.\n\n**Other opinions**:\n\n1. [weird tfa ry4x2 off notes](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/924hnt/what_the_heck_is_wrong_with_my_tpa_ry4_double/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# DIYFS Holy Holy Grail RY4 v1\n\n**Test**: Mixed at 6% and steeped 22 days\n\n**Description**: A much more caramel and sweet version of ry4 than tpa ry4x2. Caramel is less pronounced and I even get a slight coconut creaminess off of it at 6%. Maybe actual coconut of maybe some cream with a coconut vibe, but it’s there. What I’m getting at 6% is a coconut cream upfront with a sickly sweet caramel to follow. I immediately want to crank this up to 8-10 to see if it’s a sweetener type or just from the caramel. I feel in my mouth that sweetness lingering just a bit too long stickiness like sucralose and I'm surprised I never really noticed it before now. I guess just the hint of additional tobaccos are enough to cover it up. However I had stopped using it in tobacco mixes as a sweetener just because I could pick out the distinctive flavoring as low as 2% and found it distracting. I'm suspecting now that it is more about that sweetness than anything else since I have never added sucralose/sweetener to a tobacco mix. Honestly, I'm even wondering right now if this is one of the special secrets that makes this flavor so cultishly popular. I have this weird love hate with sweetness. I like it for a little at first and then get rather tired and sick of it quickly. In my own personal mixes I was much more happy to use straight caramel over HHG or even TPA RY4x2 and in hindsight, suspect this is the reason which makes me wildly reluctant to even bother continuing to clone it when I’m happy with other flavors to make ry2-4 ish blends.\n\nI get a lot more of a brighter caramel overall here and not sure if it’s the sweet that bumps it up. Also, the vanilla is more pronounced. It’s there but at 6%, I’d be hard pressed to pick it out distinctly. It’s more of an overall kind of a dessertish vibe that comes from the presence of vanilla to me, a little bit of brown sugar perhaps? If I were to compare the two, HHG is more of a one shot bright, sweet caramel whereas TPA ry4x2 is more of a tobacco base with caramel notes, ‘dirtier’ because no excessive sweetness. Like TPA is the 80% dark chocolate of the RY4 world while HHG is the milk Chocolate, better on it’s own but distinguishable wherever it is. I cant seem to figure out if there is something creamy in here or not. I think i’ll have to try this up higher to pull that out more.\n\nIf Ry4x2 really is half of the basis of HHG v1, then I think we are talking a fair amount less tobacco than TPA ry4x2 and some caramel, vanilla and sweet added. With all that, I really barely get tobacco here at all. Any tobacco muskiness is really quite covered up if not diluted to oblivion.\n\n**Other opinions**:\n\n1.

You should know that it's not you, it's your flavors. It happens to all mixers at some point. It's not a big deal. It's cool, really. We can just cuddle (and talk dirty, I hope).\n\nAnyway, I'm rocking 8 wraps, kanthal, on a 2.0mm single, spaced coil, at around 20 watts on an RTA. I explored it up to 30 for this review, but I'm always around 18-23 watts tops. I feel weird even disclosing that, because it feels like a dirty secret, but I realize it's important for flavor reviews, so, here I am. This is me. I like high builds and I cannot lie, and battery life can't be denied.\n\n3% after a 3-day steep - Dear jesus, this is awful. I might actually go to my next High School reunion and waste some of this this on some bottom-shelf plastic-jug vodka with TFA Grape Juice or FW Grapeberry Ice and tell 'em it's [Everclear Purple Passion!](http://drinkpurplepassion.com/) **LOL!**\n\nBut seriously, Everything said about this flavor is 100% true, BUT... it's worth noting that if you already have this flavor, you kind of can work with it, and make something sorta' vapeable. The secret? A 10-day steep. \n\nIs it still chalky/powdery? Yes, but in exactly the way that Razzles, SweetTarts, PixyStix and all that other bullshit candy is. Before that, it's hellacious. Bitter, harsh and noxious. After that? No moreso than the junk candies it's trying to emulate already are.\n\nTo see what I mean, try this:  \n**5% FA Forest Fruit  \n2% FW Sour  \n3% TPA SweetTANGY**\n\nMix it at 70/30 VG/PG, shake the hell out of it, DO NOT heat/breathe-steep it, just close it up tight, hide it somewhere temperate and dark, and come back to it in 10 days or so after another good shake. It's a dead-nuts-on Sour Berry SweetTart. \n\nIs it great? Nope. Is it good? Yeah, actually. Better than any premium SweetTart-type juice I've bought. \n\nThere are a million tastier things you can mix up out there, but as far as that powdery junk candy? You can't do better than TFA SweetTANGY.  \n\nSour just doesn't translate into ejuice yet. As /u/enyawreklaw  has already [explained](http://diyordievaping.com/2016/09/07/flavor-talk-sour-vapes-diy-ejuice-mixing-tips/). For now, this'll do. 4-stars from me, with all aforementioned reservations.\n\nIf you don't already have this flavor, seriously, don't buy it for this. It's gah-bige, as [my people](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dorchester/) would say. Take that FA Forest Fruit and use it it any one of a bah-zillion better recipes.\n\nI hope this review is helpful to all the poor suckers, like me, who bought this, hoping for a sour junk-candy vape.",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** TPA Sweet Cereal Flakes, 3% and 6%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 19 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Wet, lightly frosted bran flakes.  The second opinions on this are substantially more positive than mine, so make sure to check those.\n\n[TPA's description for this is \"A sugary corn flake cereal.\"](https://shop.perfumersapprentice.com/p-8436-sweet-cereal-flakes-flavor.aspx)  So conceivably this is modeled after frosted flakes.  I'm getting more raisin bran, without the raisins.  It's a dryer, duller multigrain cereal base that doesn't really have the sweetness or warmth of corn flakes.  Really slight multigrain type of earthiness here with something like a hot iron type of flavor on the extreme tail end. The cereal is a bit bland and has some of that cardboard effect with a dense mouthfeel but not much flavor saturation.\n\nI do get some powdered sugar type sweetness that could pass as the frosted part of a frosted flake, and it actually does taste a bit separated from the cereal base.  Flavor is right, but it doesn't seem super frosted.  I'd give it about a 3 out of 10 on the frosted scale.\n\nTexture here is a bit strange.  It's a very dense vape, but it doesn't really have the grainier mouthfeel you'd expect from a cereal.  Doesn't seem to have any kind of harder AP crunch to it.  Mouthfeel is still very full and thick, but the cereal feels pre-sogged.\n\nThe only other corn cereal flavor I've tried is CAP Cereal 27, and this is fairly different.  Cereal 27 is a bit less dense, but it's crunchier and warmer.  Even with the frosted part, I think CAP Cereal 27 is a bit sweeter.  Cereal 27 reminds me more an actual corn flake than TPA Sweet Cereal Flakes.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Dense, but not much flavor saturation.  Solo, comes off a bit cardboardish.  Tastes more like bran than corn. Something kind of metallic on the back end of the flavor.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  No real bite, but dense enough it's a bit hard to take a deep inhale with it, at least solo.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 3%, this is probably as close as this is going to get to a corn flake flavor.  I don't get much frosting, and it's still too dark for a corn base. Dense flavor, but not uncomfortably so.  Very mild cardboard.\n\nAt 6%, this is quite a bit denser but still not crispy. Frosted part is coming through a bit more clearly, but this feels even darker and branish.\n\nJust based on these tests, I'd be using this an accent flavor between 2-3% if you wanted anything but a daker cereal flavor.  If you did want to go that way, I'd probably go for about 5% as a primary flavor.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I'm not sure this is going to work as a solo or primary frosted flakes flavor.  You could get some crunch and sweetness to this by adding in Cereal 27 or straight AP, but the duller bran flavor here is going to pull it off a profile a bit.\n\nBut, if you needed a bran flavor the frosted part of this isn't going to stick out when mixed.  Maybe use this to add some depth to a a muffin or bread base.\n\nOr hey, raisin bran.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  [Here's the ELR Page.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/176926)  User \"Silhouette\" writes: \"Great Frosted Flakes flavor, not as convincing or unique as Speckled Flakes, but still wonderful.\"  User \"Outlaw\" also seems to dig this: \"This smells like Frosted flakes, like tony the tiger ain't got shit on these... So i made stand alone at 5% taste like frosted flakes right away will have to see what time does. so far im happy with this one.\"\n\n[One review up on BCF.](https://www.bullcityflavors.com/sweet-cereal-flakes-tfa/#product-reviews)  User \"Amber M\" wrote a review titled \"Frosted Awesome\" : \"I'm giving 5, even though this flavor could stand to be a little more potent than what I expect from TPA. It is a really nice, grainy cereal with hints of Frosted sweetness, although it really could use a little more Frosted sugar finish. It's actually not as grainy or potent as TPA Rice Crunchies, which does make it a little more versatile. It can easily be used to add a little crunch to a cereal or cheesecake recipe. I was hoping this would be similar to Speckled Flakes OOO, sadly it's lacking about a quarter of the potency of Speckled Flakes. It's not really too AP heavy, making it very easy to blend with a multitude of flavors. I usually have to use between 2-4% to get a nice grain from this in a mix. It is a splendid flavor though, just light.\"\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** TPA Toasted Almond @ %2, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 15 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Accurate toasted almond top notes over a nondescript creamy while still fluffy body.  Some greener uncooked nut notes here but no cherry-ish almond extract flavor.  Moderately dry and solidly toasted.  Just sweet enough to not be astringent and chemical if used sparingly.\n\nInhale is nutty, closer to raw, greener nuts than toasted. Some dense, but slightly sour body. Some really, really low-key sweetness. Exhale is dense, with a thicker creamy but still kind of dry and fluffy raw nut base. Really authentic toasted almond top notes, with a realistic level of bitterness and roasted in there. Top notes are good, but relatively thin. At 2%, they kind of get pushed around by that denser, greener base. More harshness on the exhale than the inhale. Just enough sweetness to pull the flavor together. Lingering, slightly bitter \"toasted\" note and some of the sourness from that raw nut base.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  I may be the only person who thinks nut flavors have a metallic aftertaste, so a huge pile of salt with that. Other than that, not really.  Maybe a little softer than you'd expect without a solid pyrazine grittiness or crunch.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Moderate to light. Takes a couple drags to settle in, but after that it's not that bad.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  A more realistic almond that won't swamp your mixes at a lower percentage. Good fit for creams and custards when you don't want to take it in the full almond milk direction.\n\nGood for drier, more delicate bakeries. Should manage to pull off a discrete almond component or topping.\n\nMixing with fruits, I'd stay with syrupy, jammy fruits like Apricot or blueberry. Should work with some juicier non-perfumey apples.\n\nGood mixer for tobaccos, the nutty note here when used low should work to bring in some nuttiness without moistening up the base too much.\n\n**Notes:**  S&V concentration testing, do yourself a favor and start low. At .25% I'm getting mostly a lightly toasted almond top note. .5% has a darker roast to those almonds with very little of the creamier body here. 1% is still pretty good, with that body taking a backseat to a good toasted almond note. 1.5% is getting a bit distractingly soft while also picking up some dry fluffyness.  2% seems to be about the useful limit here, as you get quite a bit of body that doesn't really mesh with the almond top notes. 2.5% is getting a bit bitter for me and by 3% the toasted almond notes are bitter and the base is tasting sour and metallic.  I'd start with down at .25% and work up for bakeries, .5% for stronger tobaccos, and maybe 1% for creams and custards if your base will hide that body well.\n\nAll in all, a pretty pleasant surprise. I don't find this as creamy as FA Almond, and it definitely tastes a lot more roasted and has a more specific almond (instead of almond extract) taste to it.  FA almond can push towards almond milk for me, and this gives a better solid almond note, especially when mixed low and you let those top notes sort of sit over a heavier base.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[ELR is all over the place with this.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/24) In general, it looks the people using this low are fairly complementary.  Some complaints of bitterness at higher percentage and a couple super negative notes without much context.\n\n[Post about almond extract flavor.  /u/shrine399/ suggests FA Almond and TFA toasted almond. About the toasted almond: \" TFA's is a little easier to work with, and maybe a little creamier.\"  /u/snapshotdod/ follows up with \"toasted almond is very much toasted, and probably not the sweet almond you looking for. That said, I love it. It a great standalone for me. I love the toasted part.\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/3i1rj2/almond_extract_flavor/)\n\n[Generally postive reviews on BCF.

Might work extremely well for some chai tea recipes for an obscure spiced milk note.  Not sure if TFA's Vanila Bean Ice Cream can be subbed out using this flavor.  I just haven't used VBIC yet... but do feel that it can step in for a more complex use than their Vanilla Swirl.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Speculation** I have no real frame of reference for gelato.  Never tried it, so can't imagine how accurate this represents it.  It's possible that this could work if for something like vanilla soda.  It might even combine well with an orange and dark cola.  Anywhere that vanilla type flavors are combined with cinnamon, this would probably be a nice combination like some complex bakeries (a la mode?).  I would not likely ever use this in any kind of liquor.\n\nIt does seem like heavy vaping this as a stand-alone will lead to vaper's tongue within a few hours.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** TFA Vanilla Bourbon @ 2%, 60% VG, 40% VG, Steeped 30 days\n\n**Flavor Description:** Dark vanilla extract with a malty edge to it. Reminiscent of the low notes from DIYFS Holy Vanilla, although it doesn't seem as rich or nuanced.  Flat flavor, all low sweetness and rich vanilla.\n\nInhale is slightly sour, malty vanilla. Fairly thin, moderate sweetness but really bottom-heavy and deep.  Exhale is again really deep. Malt forward, with a really soft almost roasted vanilla flavor.  Thick and creamy, but without any dairy notes. Most of the flavor is down low without a lot of top notes. Moderate dark sweetness here, almost a molasses flavor.  Could just be my rapidly gunking coils but this has almost a roasted coffee flavor in there too.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Surprisingly malty, but not unpleasant. Lots of dark sugar and roasted flavors, but again, that could just be a cry for help from my coils.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Not really.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:** Dark rich vanilla, seems suited for heavier mixes. Should work well with richer, buttery bakeries. Tastes quite a bit like vanilla extract without the alcohol note. Adds quite a bit of richness.  The lack of top notes here is going to work really well with those heavier flavors.\n\nIn the same vein, I could see this working with heavy custards and ice creams that border on frozen custard. Maybe INW Creme Brulee as well.  I'd use this for a malty note in milkshakes, where that is called for. It's a dark flavor, so you'd have to use it low and reinforce it with a brighter vanilla.\n\nThat roasted malt note is fun, and it shows up low. I'm almost thinking that this would lend a kind of porter-ish note to a cocktail mix. I could also see that malt working well to add an interesting dimension to something like a hot chocolate.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nExtremely dark, almost black concentrate. Wreaking some hell on my coils.\n\nS&V Concentration testing, I get mostly malt at .5%. Some more recognizable vanilla at 1%, but thin and a bit sour. 1.5% feels like the sweet spot here, as that vanilla fills in and is actually a bit fluffy, while that malt is still there and the overall effect is a manageable sour. The sour malt just builds from there.  I'd mix this at .5% if you're just after the malt, and 1.5% if you want the vanilla in there as well. I'd avoid this at higher concentrations both because of the coil gore and the sour part of that malt note.\n\n[**INW Vanilla Bourbon Flavor Review**](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/5lqd8s/inw_vanilla_bourbon/)\n\n[**FA Vanilla Bourbon Flavor Review**](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/5lqejv/fa_vanilla_bourbon/)\n\nReally simple take on the available Vanilla Bourbon concentrates: INW reads marshmallow, TFA reads malty extract, and FA reads as a warm vanilla additive.  I'd use INW for strong, bright marshmallowy vanilla in a fruit mix or over the top rich mixes, TFA for heavy custards and bakeries without spice, and FA for lighter creams and bakeries with a bit of spice as well as nutty or tobacco mixes.\n\nHonestly, I would skip this concentrate if you have access to DIYFS Holy Vanilla. This doesn't do the malty vanilla thing as well, and seems to be a lot worse on coils.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Best note I've found is on ELR in portugese, google translation follows:](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/674)\n\n'Weak vanilla flavor even though it is a fragrance extracted from vanilla bean in 5% alcohol is weak and does not impose itself, easily gets lost in the recipe, had been left with the impression that it would give a strong blow to the throat which is not true Until it is quite soft and does not feel the alcohol, when opening the bottle almost does not have aroma, of dark brown tonality reason why it tends to soil the cotton and accumulate residues in the resistances. As vanilla aroma is very weak and bourbon just the same name, would benefit from more concentration of vanilla and some alcoholic note or wood to be an aroma with personality. To be used if we want a light and slightly predominant aroma the vanilla is however softer than its competitors.\"\n\n[The concept that this isn't related to whiskey seems to be hard for people.](http://www.bullcityflavors.com/vanilla-bourbon-tfa/)\n\n[Good quick rundown on Vaping Underground, including some other vanilla flavors.](http://vapingunderground.com/threads/vanilla-comparisons-and-short-flavor-notes.281914/)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

    "markdown": "**Setup**:  Griffin 25 w/ Ultrabo Ni80 single Clapton @0.72 ohms, \\~17 watts\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Testing**:  3.5% stand alone in 10 mL mix; 65/35 VG base w/no nicotine\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Flavor Description:**  A flat, low musk tobacco with a leathery tone and slightly woody.  It leans toward a somewhat dried-out cigarillo.  Does not taste ashy.  Nor does it have that rich tobacco flavoring found in dark leaf (that could be good or bad, depending upon personal taste).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Off Notes/Mouth Feel:**  It comes across as mostly dry with notes of dust.  It has maybe a tad bit of bitterness on the finish.  Definitely will feel as if you need to hydrate the more you vape it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Throat Hit:**  I'm not getting a throat hit, but it may be there at higher wattages.  It definitely has a bite to it; more noticeable the longer you vape it, but mostly on the tongue.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Uses:**  I imagine there won't be too many people that will vape this by itself.  Even with a drop of sweetener, you're still going to feel like it's a fairly plain tobacco that's missing a few things.  Yet I've successfully mixed a butter pecan, caramel and vanilla swirl \\[in small amounts\\] to slightly sweeten and really smooth it out.  Also mixed sweet tobacco with it and found they tend to negate each other.  So you can mute any oats/grass you might get from any other concentrates.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Pure Speculation:**  It isn't dark or rich enough to feel that cherry or grape would be a good combination with it.  Maybe if someone is really bored and wanted to try it to see.  The butter pecan really seems to moderate that leather, pushing it to the back... while still noticeable, but in a good sort of way.  I wouldn't try to use this to make an RY4 or to replace it.  Nor would I suggest using this instead of Burley or Cavendish tobacco flavors.  It might sub out okay in place of a light Virginia or Connecticut leaf.  I believe an apple or pear fruit combination would be pretty good with it.   Maybe banana would work with it?  Maybe peach... but I doubt Raspberry or any fruits that have any kind of acidic/sour/tart/bitter notes present.  Since fruit-flavored cigarillos were never my thing, probably not going to find out first-hand.  If you want to retch due to some of those rich, thick and syrupy tobaccos; this one might taste pretty good to you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**En Summa:**  This is the only flavor that I'm considering buying in the 2 ounce size.  It seems like laying off of it for a week or so, my brain starts reminiscing about the aforementioned additions (under *Uses)*.  There have been a few that simply won't use it but they may have dismissed it after single-flavor testing.  It's understandable because vaping it straight, you won't feel like it brings much value.  But if you're going to experiment, you might be very surprised!",

Some slight notes of cool whip in there, but not really a full on \"cool whip\" taste at either %. \n\n**Off-flavors:** Maybe a tiny bit of cheesiness on the exhale at 5%, but to me, it's negligible and probably wouldn't be present with other flavors added to it. \n\n**Throat hit:** Almost non-existent on the inhale, I'd give it a 3/10 on the exhale @5%.\n\n**Uses:**  Fluffing up a heavier cream, or adding milkiness to a cereal recipe. \n\n**Pairings:** Other creams, fruits, cereals, waffles.\n\n**Notes:** I don't really see this as a desirable standalone flavor, as it is rather boring by itself.

    "markdown": "Hi all, this is my first flavor review so I hope the formatting is OK as I am taking an existing review and using it as a template. I promised /u/thedirtyprojector that I would review this flavor that was, in my opinion, the key in /u/CheebaSteeba's and my [Pumpkin Cider](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/14900#pumpkin_cider_by_cheebasteeba) recipe. I am, or at least try to be, a woman of my word so here goes.\n  \n**MY Build:**  \nDual round wire coil - .25 ohm/recoil/rx 200/75 Watts.  \n\n**Percentage Mixed:**  \nStandalone /5%/ 70/30 VG/PG  \n\n**Steep Time:**  \n2 Days: As this is a fruit, it doesn't change too much in the steep process.  \n\n**First Impresstions:**  \nSo in all honesty, my first impression of this flavor, before I even ordered it, was eeewww, yam why on earth would someone make a yam flavor and where in the world would that fit in a mix. Then I thought about sweet potato pie and how close it is to pumpkin pie and thought that this would be a good addition to something pumpkin. It being fall, I NEEDED to do something with pumpkin. I am glad I got over that first impression and decided to give it a go. It is a clear flavoring with a slightly sweet, musty smell (which didn't give me any more confidence to actually put this in a mix). Once I dropped it on the back of my hand for a lick test, I noticed it was very sweet and not as musty which made me feel a little better about trying it.  \n\n**Taste:**  \nThis flavor has really surprised me. It does not have a very potent potato-ey, flavor like you might think but what you do have is a nice, sweet, mellow, starchy, if a bit earthy, bottom note. The earthiness or mustiness is a bit spicy reminiscent of a tea. This flavor has a nice, thick, creamy mouthfeel.  \n\n**Standalone/Mixer:**  \n It is quite pleasant vaping all on its own but really shines when you use it to add complexity to a recipe. It is used in the pumpkin cider recipe to add body to the pumpkin flavor and round off the harshness the pumpkin spice has.  This flavor was the glue, I believe, in the pumpkin base of this Cider recipe. It worked so perfectly in filling out the pumpkin flavor and softening any rough edges. It gives the mix a sweet, mellow fullness I really like.  \n\n**Pairings:**  \nOk, so this took some thinking about as the only thing I could think to do with this flavor is put it in your pumpkin base for fall recipes. It is such a nice thick and sweet flavor it would probably be good with custards and other creams. There, of course, always is the aforementioned sweet potato pie; throw a little maple in there, some brown sugar and perhaps a little marshmallow and a touch of cinnamon and maybe some pecan and you have a traditional thanksgiving sweet potato casserole. I don't really think you would get a lot of use out of this flavor so a 10 ml will last you for a while.   \n\nThanks guys for reading this. I am glad I can contribute to this awesome community and I look forward to writing up more reviews as I am terribly behind on single flavor testing. As always you can find other awesome flavor reviews in our [awesome wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)!\n\n",

It's not too heavy or coyingly lemon, but not too light. The strawberries are light and refreshing and don't overpower the fresh squeezed lemon. Sit under the porch, in the shade and enjoy this vape with your lemonade. You won't be disappointed. \n\nGood by itself or:\nMixes with:\n\nFruits: Definitely more strawberry, blackberries, black currants, pear, perhaps apples (think tart?), lemons, limes, citrus with zest.\n\nVanilla: Lightly, something to simply accent the flavor.\n\nCreams: Again lightly, possibly fresh cream or anything with a light body, if you get into vienna or things with fluff it might get too much texture. Think milky/cream style.\n\nAlcohol: You might be surprised here. Gin or vodka could go quite well with this flavor. Any juniper berries.\n\nAdditives: Play around with the cool effect as it could be quite interesting. Whichever you prefer. Start light and add to taste. Sweetener if you like really sweet, but it is pretty balanced as it is. \n\nFinish notes: All in all a really good flavor. A very balanced and good all day vape. Keep this in your collection of must haves. \n\n\n\n",

    "markdown": "Flavour Name: VSO Apple SFT at 10%, 6%, 70/30, 1mg.\nTested on: Hadaly, single alien SSL13, 0.42 ohms, 40w\nSteeped for: 1 day and 1 week \n\nFlavour Description: red/green apple- maybe similar to a Braeburn? It’s a pretty complex flavour for an apple. Really authentic, realistic, natural apple. Lovely sweetness, some nice tartness. Has a great amount of juiciness. A little bit of mealy texture. The peel note runs throughout and sits on top of a juicy, apple flesh base. There's a little separation between the peel and flesh, but like it would be if eating an apple. Authentic amount of peel if not used at too high of a %. Overall it's just really a good, really authentic complete apple. \n\nAfter a week it didn’t change.\n\n\nMouthfeel/ Texture: really juicy. Slight mealy texture.\n\nOff Notes: soapy off note at higher %s. \n\nThroat Hit: none. Which is good as I get a mild to moderate throat hit from most apples. \n\n% Testing: 10% is too high as the peel note is soapy. It runs most of the way through the vape so could make it tricky to cover. The peel note is pretty prominent, maybe 60% peel and 40% flesh? \n\nAt 6% I’m not getting the soapy off note. It's full flavoured at 6% and there is a much better balance between the peel and flesh now. Probably around 80% flesh, 20% peel? It's still almost as juicy as it was at 10% and nearly as full flavoured. \n\nMight work better at around 4-5%? I do occasionally get a hint of that soapy note at 6%. It's only a hint and only occasionally though.\n\nUse and Pairings: I could vape it as a SF. I think you could use this wherever you wanted a natural, realistic apple. I might also use this to give another apple a peel note, mealy texture and juiciness. Although it's so good I'd probably want to use this as a main, or only apple. It isn't lacking in anything so could probably use it as the only apple in a mix. Might be good as a background to a fruit mix, but you're likely going know there's apple in there due to the peel. \n\nI don't know how it would fair as a cooked apple. Maybe the addition of FA Liquid Amber could push it in that direction?",

It’s not quite a ‘Pumpkin Spice’, but it is very similar to one.  There’s alot going on here, but at @ 14% it comes together really well.  The Pumpkin is very accurate (for once), and the Spices are well-chosen.   Since it’s made with natural extracts, there pretty much no off-notes...  which is quite an accomplishment.  I can’t tell you how many other pumpkin-spiced flavors have either destroyed my tank or laid waste to my taste buds.\n\nIf you‘re looking for a more natural pumpkin vibe, go with VSO’s straight-up *Pumpkin* flavor.  If you’re looking for a more cream-forward experience, *OSDIY Pumpkin Spice Cream* is an absolute killer.  But if you want a delicious, complex vape to go with your morning coffee, Harvest Moon is the way to go.  One thing’s for sure - VSO knows how to rock a Pumpkin.",

Tested fresh and once a week after. Tested @ 5% & 7%\n\n**VTA'S Description:** \" exotic feijoa fruit (found in New Zealand)flavour that’s juicy with a sweet sensation . Also known as Pineapple Guavas and Guavasteen, this flavour adds a nonce of pineapple, banana, mint, strawberry and guava which is the comparative combination of flavours which makes this fruit so unique. This flavour pairs well with stone fruits, berries and works perfectly in desserts, bakery, candy and even tobacco styled e-liquid recipes. This is definitely a must have to add to your exotic range of flavours. Be sure to check out our other range of exotic flavours. Perfect in a mix or as a standalone.\"\n\n**5%:** Freshly mixed get some sour pineapple like notes, green banana is there, also has a creamy banana like mouthfeel along with a banana after taste. Also a little on the dry side some slight throat tingling harshness.\nAfter a week of steeping this flavor seemed fully steeped me. The green banana note pushed its way forward, and is now the main note I get. Sourness is on the end of exhale. Also getting some mint like coolness as VTA said in their description. The dry/harshness was faintly present at 35 watts. So I rewicked my Goon and tested it at 100 watts. The harshness was far more present, but still light enough that it could be covered up in a mix.\n\n**7%** Harshness got a little stouter, but still tolerable. Sour & coolness were more pronounced. Not getting any of strawberry or guava that VTA described when vaped, but when tasted on back of hand. I can definitely tell a strawberry/guava is present.\n\n**Conclusion** Complex flavor with multi-layers of notes. Should be great for a wide range of usages in recipes. At 5&7% it was an overall pleasant single flavor test experience. \n\nThe recipe I tested this flavor in is one my own a Feijoa & Peach Rice Pudding\n\n<VT> (Apollo Feijoa) @3%\n\n<FA> (Peach) @1.5\n\n<FE> (Sweet Rice) @5%\n\n<FLV> (Vanilla Pudding) @2%\n\nThe Feijoa shines through the rice and pudding & the dryness is covered by the pudding and peach\n",

When freshly mixed it had a slight chemical like note with some faint musky coffee in the back ground. After it steeped for 14 days. On the nose it smells like the coffee filter after you brewed the coffee. When vaped it seems gritty like campfire/cowboy coffee. Does leave a lingering coffee taste in your mouth.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Vape Train Blackberry, 1%, 4% and 8%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 28 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Some realistic blackberry with a heavier dark berry candy edge.\n\nI am getting some distinct blackberry here.  There is a realistic dark blackberry tartness.  Feels more like a true blackberry tartness rather than the flatter, sweeter himalayan blackberry. It's not really center-stage in the flavor, but the blackberry that I can taste is fairly accurate.  Light floral edge, but on the tame side compared to some of the other widely available blackberries (*cough* Flavourart *cough*)\n\nIf I didn't know what I was vaping, I would have guessed boysenberry though.  Specifically, this tastes a lot like a fresh, realistic blackberry flavor mixed with PUR Boysenberry Preserves.  There's a candy sweetness and stickiness that reminds me a lot of that swedish fish-ish flavor that FA Blackcurrant can pick up.  Seems to be bullying that more delicate realistic blackberry a bit.\n\nOverall, that sweetness and texture does pull the flavor more into the candy category.  It almost has a fresh blue raspberry thing going on (if that isn't the dumbest sentence to ever appear on this sub.)\n\n**Off-Flavors:**  Too sweet and sticky for a fresh blackberry.  Brighter boysenberry or candy blackcurrant thing going on.  Light floral edge.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light.  Bit of a bite but nothing major for a berry.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 1% this feels floral and thin. Just getting a bare hint of a dark berry flavor.\n\nAt 4% I'm already getting more of that boysenberry candy flavor than realistic blackberry. Moderate body and sweetness, florals feel pretty restrained.\n\nAt 8% that floral note has picked up a bit and doesn't quite seem to be cohering with that candy type base. Heavier body and a good deal of sweetness. Realistic blackberry is getting a bit lost.\n\nVape Train suggests mixing with this at 3-5% and 5-9% as a standalone.  Just based on these tests, I'd be on the low end of that.  I'd probably be using this around 3% as an accent and 6% as a primary note.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  While this isn't \"bad\" or unpleasant at all, it doesn't squarely fit into a blackberry profile for me.\n\nI'd accentuate the candy berry thing going on here instead of going hard blackberry.  Should work pretty well in brighter, vibrant candy type applications.  I'd play it off an aggressive raspberry like INW.  You could also further accentuate that sticky redness with some CAP 27 Fish or FA Blackcurrant.\n\nMixing this with a darker blackberry flavor like TPA Blackberry should add a bit of realism back if you wanted to attempt this in a bakery or custard type profile.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  Not seeing anything out there.\n\n[Here is the product page from Vape Train.  Their description: \"a sweet and tart juicy berry that fits into most recipes. This ejuice flavour pairs well with Apple, Boysenberry, Lemon, Lime, Mango, Melon, Nectarine, Peach, Pear, Raspberry, Strawberry and Tangerine flavours making it very versatile for the seasoned mixer.\"  So basically every fruit?](https://www.vapetrain.com.au/shop/vt-concentrates/blackberry-flavour-concentrate-diy-for-e-juice-recipe/)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Vape Train Blood Orange Champagne, 1%, 4% and 8%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 17 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Great champagne, fake-ish orange. Feels like an orange sparkling wine beverage you'd buy in a can, rather than a mimosa.\n\nThe champagne here works really well.  It has some fairly convincing effervescence, more so than FW Pink Champagne and probably pushing up against FLV Root Beer in the fizz arms race.  Definitely tastes light and sparkling.  I'm actually getting some of that mineral twinge you get from champagne that isn't straight prosecco.  Light, but accurate, kind of booziness here.  Doesn't go the sour acidic route like TPA Champagne.\n\nThe blood orange here isn't all that realistic.  It feels like a flatter, almost candy blood orange flavor instead of a tarter actual citrus.  Does taste like the blood variety of orange flavor though, with a light bitterness to it offsetting at least a bit of that candied body.  That blood orange bitterness plays really nicely with that light mineral note from the champagne base.  I'm not getting any real zest or heavy waxy notes.  The orange here feels like a slightly more bitter version of FA Blood Orange.\n\nThat sweeter orange weighs down some of the etherealness of the fizzy champagne base, but overall it still has a pretty solid sparkle to it. Ends up feeling just a bit on the sweet side for a realistic champagne, but nothing too sticky or cloying.\n\n**Off-Flavors:**  Artificial rather than realistic blood orange flavor.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light? I mean, it has a bit of bite but nothing really explicitly harsh.  Hit seems to fit with the profile.\n\n**Percentage testing:**At 1%, I'm not getting much out of this.  Light texture, light mineral tang from the champagne, and a bit of thin bitter orange.\n\nAt 4%, this is actually pretty well balanced. Light, fizzy texture.  Sweet blood orange flavor, starting to taste a bit candied but not too cloying.\n\nAt 8%, nothing really tastes offensive based on the profile, but I feel like that blood orange is maybe getting too sweet and candied and is steamrolling that champagne base.  That blood orange bitterness is also getting a bit aggressive and throaty.\n\nVape Train suggests using this at 2-5% in a mix, or 5-9% standalone.  That sounds fine. Just based on these tests, I'd probably be around 7% as a solo flavor, 5% for a cocktail application where both the orange and champagne are going to work for you, and maybe 2-3% where you're mostly trying to grab the texture and some orange.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Cocktails, basically.\n\nYou could the easy route, march in lock step with ID10-T and pair it up with FLV Morning Mimosa like in his [\"1-2-3 Sparkling Mimosa.\"](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/90487#1_2_3_sparkling_mimosa_by_id10_t)  Congratulations mixers, he beat us all to the low hanging fruit.  But we can go deeper.\n\nIf you want to stay on the brunch theme, you could probably cover up some of that pronounced oranginess with a heavier peach flavor like JF Honey Peach or FLV Peach and get yourself a perfectly serviceable bellini.  It's going to be sweet, but brunch and all.\n\nI don't think you'll be able to mix around the orange, but you have some cocktail options where it can be slipped in fairly unobtrusively.  You want to do a French 75? The orange in here could be bent toward a more generic citrus with some extra lemon. I'd say the cognac version would probably work a bit better, but this should work just fine with the gin version.  I'd even say you could do a classic champagne cocktail and just don't call attention to the fact you're using orange instead of lemon.  Add some INW Shisha Punch and you're set to go.\n\nStill not odd enough? I think the fizz in here could make a fairly effective cocktail texturizer, giving a thinner body to some pretty traditionally heavy and not really liquid-like alcohol flavors, especially with a light touch of cooling.  That champagne flavor isn't too aggressive and will be pretty easily masked by more aggressive and darker liquor flavors.  Plus, a boatload of stuff uses orange liqueurs like Curacao, Grand Marnier, or even just chunks of oranges.\n\nDoes your old fashioned taste like an old fashioned hard candy? Lighten and brighten it up with some of this mess.\n\nYou want to go big and try to get a workable sazerac-esque cocktail with a spin like a [Millionare?](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2014/04/millionaire-cocktail-rye-whiskey-grenadine-pastis-curacao-prohibition-era-drink-recipe.html)  Try some of this.\n\nIt's also pretty good solo if you're into that sort of thing.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  [Noted *literally* just did an episode on Oranges.  At 3:40, the mighty ID10-T has some notes on this one.  Selected excerpts: \"They ruined an amazing champagne flavor by adding blood orange flavor to it.\"  \"It's yummy, it's not bad.\"  \"super accurate champagne flavor\"  \"not actual orange juice\" \"generic store brand 0 calorie sparkling water (type of orange)\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3-mTEmQcPY&t=220s) ... and just for the record I'm pretty sure I coined the FLV Prison Wine term.  Fite me.\n\n[Here's the product page.  Their description: \"bubbly champagne flavour with a dash of blood orange. This is a fantastic unique flavour profile to lead the way into beverage and alcohol styled e-liquid recipes. This flavours versatile to use, and lends a champagne like mouthfeel note that’s infused by a clean subtle citrus note from the blood orange.

    "markdown": "Tested @ 3% and 9%, steeped 6 days, zenith kanthal 0.8 coils etc etc\n\nAlright this was the flavour I left for last because me and Blueberry/Blue Raspberry/Blue cotton candy have a long history. Primarily because I've never tried this shit IRL so I have no clue wtf it's supposed to taste like, but also because my fave premium juice when I was vaping premium used it as the main note. So for me the search and analysis of the best blue/blueberry/blue raspberry cotton candy (I'll just call it BBCC now if you don't mind) was a long and tedious one. Alright first my two main faves on this flavour:\n\nFW BBCC - They just call it Blueberry cotton candy. It's some super sweet but super delicious and super EMed up concoction. If not for the sweetness, I'd be vaping this day in day out in my Atlantis by Decoded clone. HOWEVER, it's so bloody sweet and gunks up my coils so much. It's also very prone on giving massive vaper tongue. Like 5-10ml is all I need to lose a sense of taste of what I'm vaping. \n\nCAP BBCC - they call it Blue Raspberry Cotton Candy for whatever reason. I won't judge the name because as I said I've never had this in my life. It almost sparkles from how nice the flavour is! Less % needed than FW's, less sweet, less coil gunk, but the flavour fades out super quick like after 2-3 days it's not the same. My preferred choice for Atlantis Decoded clone, altho gotta be careful when pouring it, since just a 0.5% over the top and it changes the taste completely. \n\nAnd now for VTA's BBCC - PERFECTION! Oh my god so good! The 3% is EXACTLY what I needed and since it's not feeling over EMed at 3% it doesn't just fade away into oblivion like some Harry Ambrose wet dream, but instead stays there and reminds me of its presence! So yummy! 9% was a fail tho, I really couldn't taste it, just the presence of something super sweet and caramelized sugary leftovers in my mouth. I guess at 9% it's to serve the function of some next level blender? Or it requires a fresh batch of juice and to be kept as a SnV/left to steep with other flavours in? I'm not sure and frankly I have no reason to experiment further because at 3% it fulfills exactly what I need in a much cheaper (3% versus 11% FW/8.5% CAP) and much tastier and fresher feeling BBCC. However, the 3% will defo be tested out with some of my faves such as Beard whatever clone (10% CAP BBCC + 5% CAP Hibiscus but with VTA BBCC instead of the CAP one), my Atlantis Decoded recipe will be getting this treatment and I'm currently plotting a brand new recipe which will take a fresh new look at Atlantis. \n\nDo I recommend this? If you use any BBCC yes defo, this is THE ultimate BBCC. Is this a staple? Nah, BBCC is a more childish niche for people wanting to experience 'Muricanized childhood I guess (I think this is supposed to be a very American flavour at least, do correct me if I'm wrong). What will this blend with? Bah, anything really, hell I'd even use it as a EM substitute if the recipe needs more texture, because this baby offers plenty of texture! \n\nGet it, my fellow BBCC fans and never look back. Thank you VTA for this wonderful flavour, I am gonna save so much money now! \n\nTune in Soon™ for my Atlantis by Decoded clone's counterproposal of a recipe and comparison between em. Tune in maybe in 2-3 months for some more flavour reviews when I'm done with my current stock of flavours.",

Aftertaste was like a blueberry powder candy like a pixie stick. After it steeped for 2 weeks I tried vaping it. It taste a lot like VT Strawberry Jam. Like a blueberry hard candy with a chewy center. I also really coats the tongue like the aforementioned VT Strawberry Jam. Has a thick and smooth mouthfeel. It is a decent enough blueberry that I could see using it in recipes. It is just not a authentic blueberry to me. It does have some jelly/jam like quailties in the mouthfeel. \n\n**Pairings:** This would go well in candy mixes, creams, other fruits. ",

    "markdown": "*Disclaimer: I didn't pay for this, shoutout to Vape Train for sending this to me.*\n\n**Setup:** Recoil w/ flavor barrel, Dual 12 wrap 24g 3.5mm SS316 @.32 ohms. 60w power, 450F temp limit. Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Vape Train Bourbon, 1%, 4% and 8%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 24 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Boozy heat on a thin, sweet bourbon.\n\nThe base here definitely reads as a bourbon.  There's a fairly prominent sweetness to it that feels a lot like a sort of mass market bourbon level of sweetness.  Tastes appropriately mellow and corn-ish. There's also a bit of oak in here.  Not really overwhelmingly charred or intense, but enough to come across as an oak as opposed to a peat or any other kind of whiskey barrel.  Light fruitiness, but it reads pretty accurate as that light, overripe funk from fermentation.  Tastewise, pretty close to a low to mid-shelf bourbon.\n\nThere is also a boozy punch to the top end of this, and it feels reasonably accurate to a sweeter bourbon. Accurate hotter alcohol notes.  They do seem to have calmed down a bit from mixing fresh, but still pretty solid for 3+ weeks of a steep.  Not overwhelmingly boozy, but gets the point across pretty well.\n\nSeems to have some textural issues.  Like the other Vape Train boozes I've tried, it's a fairly thin vape.  Most of the flavor here feels like it's in the top end, and without a heavier base that bourbon sweetness feels a bit sticky and thin. More like smelling bourbon than actually consuming it, but I mean, vaping and all.\n\nRight off the bat, this doesn't really work like any of the other bourbons I've tried.  It's thinner and boozier than the whole lot including TPA Kentucky Bourbon, FW Whiskey, and FLV Bourbon.  Doesn't' feel like it's going to be an easy sub for anything.  It's sweet like TPA Kentucky Bourbon but significantly less substantial.  The Oak here isn't quite as aggressive as FLV Bourbon but it's pushing in that direction.  And while it isn't as funky and almost meaty as FW Whiskey, it has some of those same weirdly savory qualities.\n\n**Off-Flavors:**  What's here tastes fine, but it doesn't really have a heavier, fuller base to the flavor.  Feels thin and top heavy by itself.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Moderate, but booze and all.  Not unduly harsh for the general level of booziness.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 1%, at least with this kind of steep, I'm not getting much out of this. Slight booziness and a bit of sweetness. Nothing that really identifiably tastes like a whiskey.\n\nAt 4%, this is reading just a bit more like a whiskey.  Still feels more like boozy top notes rather than a rich, robust full whiskey flavor.  Light char, light sweetness, but really more just about that top-end booziness.\n\nAt 8%, this is definitely a little boozier, but still doesn't feel like a full whiskey flavor.  A bit sweeter, and lightly fruity.  Char seems about unchanged.\n\nVape Train suggests a pretty wide range for this: 1-5% mixed, and 5-9% solo. Just based on these tests, I'd be using this as an accent flavor around 3-4%.  While it isn't unvapeable up higher, it doesn't really seem to be bring anything extra to the table at higher percentages.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**    I'd call this a whiskey booster more than a discrete bourbon.  Solo, there just isn't enough body here to convey a strong bourbon flavor.\n\nSeems to pretty a natural fit with something like TPA Kentucky Bourbon which has that sweeter, heavier body but no distinct booziness to speak of.  I'd use the Kentucky Bourbon as a base and just let this fill in some of the hotter booze notes in cocktail applications.\n\nWhile the booziness here does lean bourbon, I don't think it's too oaky to use with other whiskeys like FA Whisky.  Should do largely the same thing without turning that scotch base over to bourbon.  VT does have a scotch whiskey flavor that I'll be testing later though, so it may not be your best option there.\n\nIf you did want to use this without whiskey backup, it could work for a lighter cocktail application like a (weaker tasting) whiskey and coke.\n\nThis wouldn't really be my choice for non-cocktail bourbon applications.  Bourbon with creams, custards, and bakeries is generally more about the sweetness and body rather than any booziness. While this may end up being interesting with tobaccos, it's not going to really blend so much as add booze.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  Still pretty minimal.\n\n[User \"King4aVape\" wrote in an earlier thread about Vape Train: \"bourbon - for me it's miles ahead from Kentucky bourbon tfa. Sweet, boozy, bourbony like the real deal.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Vape Train Boysenberry, 1%, 4% and 8%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 33 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Dark berry candy.  Might be a boysenberry?\n\nThis tastes a bit generic, but it could definitely be a boysenberry.  It’s maybe a bit tarter than a blackberry but doesn’t taste much like a raspberry.  Easy “boysenberry” math checks out, then.  More artificial than realistic berry flavor.  At higher percentages, gets fairly saturated and sweet, but the mouthfeel doesn’t really turn over into syrupy.  \n\nThat candy thing is reinforced by the texture here.  This seems kind of full and fluffy.  At higher percentages, it definitely has a bit of marshmallow mouthfeel.  I think I’m picking up a bit of extra vanilla in here too.  Vague FA Oba Oba esque kind of effect.  The sweetness of the berry and that texture pushes this toward a candy berry profile pretty hard.\n\nStill manages to be a bit floral though, and at higher percentages those florals get a little bitter and perfumey with almost a chemical edge to them.\n\nThe base of this flavor seems awfully similar to [Vape Train’s Blackberry](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/85319m/vape_train_blackberry/)  This doesn’t have that more realistic blackberry note, but it has that same kind of generic dark berry candy type base to it.  Comparing this to FLV Boysenberry, the FLV version doesn’t have any of the light floral edge and is syrupy and richer where this has a bit of fluffier marshmallow-esque texture.\n\n**Off-Flavors:**  There’s some vanilla in here.  Not overwhelming, but at least noticeable at higher percentages.  Lighter bitter floral edge, tastes a bit chemical.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Moderate.  This can get a bit harsh.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 1%,  I’m getting a pretty full complement of the florals here and a really light actually berry flavor.  Actually seems a bit savory here?  Which is odd?\n\nAt 4%,  the berry is fuller and not really more floral.  Very light tartness. Texture is starting to pick up some fluffy texture, and I get just the slightest hit of vanilla.\n\nAt 8%,  this is pretty fluffy overall.  Texture is pushing towards marshmallow. Berry is heavier and sweeter, with a floral slightly chemical edge.\n\nVape Train suggests mixing with this at 2-5% or standalone at 5-9%.  I’m a little more restrained than that.  Just based on these tests, I’d be closer to 3% mixed, and 5% as a primary flavor.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  The fluffier candy texture here is going to limit this one a bit.   I’d mostly stick to candies in general, as that fluffiness is going to be a bit weird in a fruit mix.  Could work at an accent percentage with creams or custards.  Not really realistic enough for bakery applications.\n\nKind of hard to recommend based on other available dark berry options.\n\n**Second Opinions:**   I can’t find anything via google.\n\n[Here is the product page from Vape Train.  Their description: “a juicy dark berry flavour that’s very versatile in many e-liquid recipes. This flavour pairs well with Apple, Lemon, Lime, Mango, Melon, Nectarine, Peach, Pear, Raspberry, Rhubarb and Strawberry. Popular blends include boysenberry and ice-cream, smoothies and heavy creams blend really well with this flavour profile as do candies, dessert, yogurts, dairy, bakery, and beverage style e-liquids recipes.”  So everything again, basically?”](https://www.vapetrain.com.au/shop/vt-concentrates/boysenberry-flavour-concentrate-diy-for-e-liquid-recipe/)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Vape Train Brandy, 1%, 4% and 8%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 26 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Fruity and boozy brandy.\n\nSuprisingly accurate boozy note here.  Actually has a medium brandy type heat, and tastes pretty well fermented and distilled. Sweeter brandy, tastes a bit cheap and funky overall, but hey it actually tastes like brandy. Some light oak barrel-ish astringency and just slightly tannic.  Nothing that feels like a char though.\n\nThis is fairly fruity.  I get a dark fermented grape note sticking out here.  The sweetness makes it seem just a bit raisiny.  Seems fairly appropriate for a brandy.  I maybe pick up an errant hint of vanilla here or there, but it's not overwhelming or distinct enough to be really distracting.  Seems to have just a bit of an orange zest at the end of the vape as well.\n\nUnlike some of the other vape train boozes, this seems to be more than just a boozy top.  There is some actual body in here.  It's not anywhere near thick or dense, but it does a serviceable job of conveying a fuller brandy flavor solo.  Again, a bit on the sweet side, but not out of bounds for a brandy flavor.\n\n**Off-Flavors:**  Tastes like a pretty cheap brandy, but nothing outside of the profile.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Moderate, but it's pretty realistically boozy.  Nothing unexpected.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 1%, this is a bit odd.  Still kind of fermented tasting, but not really boozy.  Kind of a sour, fruity bubblegum kind of vibe.  That grape is coming through pretty clear here.  Lighter flavor overall.\n\nAt 4%, definitely tastes more like a brandy and those boozy notes have filled in quite a bit. Still a bit fruity and sweet on balance, but that boozy top end sells the brandy thing fairly well.  Seems a bit thin overall.\n\nAt 8%, this is a stronger, boozier brandy.  That fruit seems more integrated with the liquor base and it's picking up a kind of sugary, raisiny sweetness.  Medium body and a boozy punch.\n\nVape Train suggests mixing with this at 2-5% or standalone at 5-8%.  I actually like it quite a bit more on the high side, but it's pretty aggressive and boozy.  Just based on these tests, I'd be mixing with this around 3-4% as an accent, or 6% as a primary flavor.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  The heavy booziness here kind of limits the applications of this to cocktails.  In general, should pair pretty well with citrus, apples, pears, and stone fruit like plums and cherries.  Could be interesting paired with FW Pink Champagne to pick up those grape fruity notes.  Maybe a bit fruity for any real classic brandy cocktails, but I'd wager this wouldn't make a bad sidecar.\n\nThis is boozy and funky enough I'm not coming up with any real applications outside of cocktails.  If you wanted more of a cooked brandy note for bakeries or creams, I'd probably just go with FA Brandy.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Hey, there's actually a note up on ELR about this.  User \"Kotsos\" writes: \"This is closer to INW Brandy than FA Brandy, quite boozy but way more balanced than the INW one (which has bitter off notes and needs extra caution in mixes), it's got warmth and depth, and a very nice brandy/whiskey aftertaste. I can imagine it taking Bourbon flavors up a notch and giving a twist to heavy tobaccos and custards/caramels, I wouldn't pair it with fruit like FA.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Vape Train Chocolate Mousse, 3% and 7%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 14 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Softer, fluffy chocolate flavor.\n\nSolid chocolate here.  Seems more like semi-sweet rather than a darker chocolate or a really rich milk chocolate. Nothing too fruity or weird, and with just a bit of bitterness to set it all off.   Sweet but not cloying, seems pretty well-balanced overall.\n\nThe mousse part this comes across more in mouthfeel than actual taste for me.  This does seem to have a fluffier mouthfeel and texture.  I’m not really picking up anything richer like a mousse.  Comes across a bit more like a chocolate whipped cream like to me, but I’m not getting any strong dairy notes.   Mostly just a fluffy chocolate.\n\nI do pick up a bit of a plastic note out of this.  Still pretty subtle at 7%, and doesn’t really show up that clearly at 3%.  Nowhere near the plastic weirdness of the reformulated INW Milk Chocolate, but seems to be there if you are looking for it.   Would probably stand out a bit more in a tiny rda.  No weird tartness like VTA Devon Cream though.\n\nAnd because it’s a chocolate, a quick note on coil gore.  Relatively light concentrate, with no really extreme gunking.  After about 15mls I’d say my wicks were a bit crispy and the flavor was becoming fairly muted, but no distinct coil gore.  Maybe a hair harder on the wicks that TPA Double Chocolate Clear, but nothing serious.\n\n**Off-Flavors:**  Light “band-aid” type plastic note at higher percentages.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Nah, I’d call it fairly smooth.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 3%, the flavor here seems a bit light.  Clear cocoa notes, but not much fullness.  Middle of the flavor feels a bit watery.  No off-flavors here though.\n\nAt 7%,  fuller chocolate.  Still not picking up much mousse, but the chocolate tastes about like the chocolate in a mousse and the mouthfeel is fluffy without feeling thin.  Light plastic note though.\n\nVape Train suggests mixing with this at 1-2% or standalone from 3-6%.  Sure, that sounds okay.  Just based on these tests, that seems like it’s in the ballpark.  I’d be more likely to use this as a base to build off at around 5-7%, but you’d get a lighter chocolate accent down around 2%.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**    Very soft, kind of diffused chocolate flavor.  Feels a lot like it’s going to sink into recipes as opposed to working like a discrete chocolate component.  Pairing this up against a milkshake base would do a fairly solid chocolate milkshake.  I could also see using this as chocolate in a chocolate cake.\n\nShould pair well with fruit flavors in general, just because the off-notes are pretty manageable.  I’d look mostly at traditional red fruits like strawberries and raspberries, but knock youself out if you really want to pair up something weirder like acai or blueberry. \n\nAlso feels like it could work to put some chocolate in a cheesecake or even a mousse. \n\n**Second Opinions:**  Again, the almighty google is coming up short.\n\n[Here is the product page from Vape Train.

This here is the most amazing and best coconut I've vaped in my life and I've tried so many. The boys from VTA have not created a flavouring, they've created a tribute to Coconut flavour. \n\nTested on a Zenith 0.8 ohm coil, Kanthal ones I believe, with Vaporesso's Gen's Pulse mode and VW mode. Quick mention of how awesome pulse mode is with fruits and with cooling, triple awesome with cooling tbf. \n\n% used: 3%\n\nI never bothered reading the \"pairs well with\" etc briefs so I'll just cut to the chase. \n\nThis flavour is absolutely insane, I can't stress how accurate it feels. It feels like pure bliss vaping it since the inhale is one, bringing a nice warm rounded body of a coconut and with the exhale you actually get the sharp notes. It smells absolutely fantastic and my room has never smelled better. Most coconut flavours I've tried other than FA's coconut have failed miserably either in smell being pungent and horrid or by being super sweet. This is the PERFECT amount of sweetness on its own, the perfect vape feeling with such delicious full bodied smoothness it just spreads through your mouth and throat in a perfect velvet smooth feeling. \n\nGuys, I really don't know what else to say, this is the best coconut flavour I've personally tried and I highly recommend everyone who's a fan of coconut to get it. \n\nI love VTA. Incredibly authentic flavours, they should just rebrand to Vape Train Authentic rather than Australia.\n\nDisclaimer: I know this isn't a great review or even a good one, but I'm seriously stunned by how absolutely amazing this coconut is. More VTA reviews coming up this week btw, got a few more of their flavourings steeping.\n\nP.S: VTA = VT in the USA afaik, just wrote it down as I see it in case it has a slightly different name like most vape juices have (looking at you FA with your 50 different words instead of just \"strawberry lime.\")\n\nEdit 1: 1.5% is apparently a no go due to resembling sun tan lotion as shown in [this comment here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/ho6lf4/vta_coconut_its_a_damn_masterpiece_get_it/fxuoiyf)!

Nothing magical about it, altho this is definitely worlds better than the rest of the coffee flavours I've tried. It's just a nice full bodied base that has just the right nose. Nothing as full bodied as a cup of Italian Espresso, more like an americano's smell. \n\nIt's good. I can see it paired with stuff like other coffees, creams maybe or some drink attempts. I am no mixologist nor am I into creamy vapes so just coupling it with other coffees. \n\n**Verdict**: 10/10 for the accurate coffee feel. As a single flavour tho I found it boring after 5 minutes and wouldn't continue like that.\n\nComplimentary recipe:\n\n3% VTA Coffee Base\n\n2% VTA Arabica Coffee\n\n1% VTA Strawberry Milk",

Mixed @ 5% & 9% 70/30\n\n**VTA Description:** \"a frothy barista steam wand milk (scoma) flavour that’s infused lightly with the finest coffee to assist in blending e-liquid recipes. This flavouring works particularly well where dairy components are required such as adding the topping to most coffee recipes such as perfecting a cappuccino or any coffee that requires that coffee milk taste. Adding to desserts, bakery and even candy recipes will benefit from this flavour. If you are seeking a milk with a slight coffee nuances.\" They suggest using SOLO: 5-9% & MIXED:1-4%.\n\n**5%:** Fresh it has a bit of skunky taste, but after a week steep that died down. After 2 weeks steep the skunkiness was gone completely and flavor seemed fully steeped and you are left with a nice coffee flavor. Some cream and milky notes. I didn't notice any butyric acid funk which is common with milk. Get some burnt notes but nothing to terrible, notice a little vanilla too. but this definitely leans towards a cappuccino type flavor than a black cup coffee with some milk/cream added to it.\n\n**9%:** On the nose it is smells very milk & creamy. On the back hand it is slightly bitter coffee with some cream & vanilla maybe even some hazelnut. Vaped coffee note is more forward and powerful. Creaminess is hanging out in the background with the vanilla. If you really look for it you can find the skunkiness still there as well. \n\n**Usages:** Obviously coffees, cappuccino, & Starbucks style recipes. I believe this could be used with an ice cream and make and excellent coffee flavored ice cream. \n\n**Conclusion:** VTA description & recommended percentages appear to hit the nail on the head. Needs a week or two steep to get rid of the skunky muskiness although it was still barely present after 3 weeks steep at 9%, but I don't know who would use this at 9% in a mix. At 5% after 3 steep this is one the better coffee flavored e-liquids I have tried. So i look forward to seeing some excellent recipes being released using this flavor. ",

    "markdown": "*Disclaimer: I didn't pay for this, shoutout to Vape Train for sending this to me.*\n\n**Setup:** Recoil w/ flavor barrel, Dual 12 wrap 24g 3.5mm SS316 @.32 ohms. 60w power, 450F temp limit. Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Vape Train Cognac, 1%, 4% and 8%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 26 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Thin, mildly boozy cognac with a bitter finish.\n\nSort of resembles cognac.  There is some brandy-ish booziness here, but I'm missing most of the caramel, barrel age, or vanilla you'd usually pick up there. Seems a bit dry overall actually, with a fairly heavy astringency.  Booze doesn't punch as hard as some of the other vt alcohol flavors.\n\nNothing all that fruity here.  Trying it next to the normal VT Brandy, the cognac is missing that fermented grape brandy base.  Some relatively light, indistinct fruit but it isn't nearly as prominent as VT Brandy or FA Brandy.  Seems closer to INW Brandy.\n\nThere's also something bitter here.  Feels like it has just a hint of rubbing alcohol on top of that cognac booziness. Feels almost herbal.  Sort of a light camphor warmth and almost a light pine taste.  It could theoretically be a barrel char or something, but it isn't quite clicking for me.  It'll kind of work as a smokiness for a couple drags and then go back to tasting just bitter and herbal.\n\nThinner flavor overall.  Seems pretty top heavy with those boozy notes, but there isn't much of a thicker base for anything to grab onto.  Fairly light on the sweetness overall, without some of the really heavy, sweet depth I'd expect from a cognac.\n\n**Off-Flavors:** Bitter and astringent.  Doesn't have much in the way of body.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Moderate.  Decent boozy bite, but there is a some harsher bitterness to it.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 1%, this is light.  Kind of a light booze and slight bitterness.  No real body.\n\nAt 4%, the booziness is coming through a bit more but so is that bitterness.  Nothing really deep, sweet, or even fruity. Still, no real body to it.\n\nAt 8%, no more boozy but maybe more bitter.  I can't tell if this is supposed to be smokey or whatever, but it doesn't really work.  And again, fairly thin and a bit undersweet.\n\nVape Train suggests mixing with this at 3-5%, and standalone from 5-10%.  Just based on these tests, I'd probably use this as a lighter accent around 3% primarily for a light booziness and realizing you'll have to work around the bitterness.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I think this one might end up being fairly difficult to use.  By itself, doesn't really do a convincing cognac flavor.  It's kind of bitter and astringent to try to be using in a sweeter cognac type cocktail.\n\nBecause this doesn't really have a fruitiness or heavy sweetness to this, you may be able to bend this one around a little bit.  I can see using a bit of this with the right mix of apples and getting close to something like a calvados or even a pear brandy.  The booziness is fairly accurate to a brandy style liquor and should blend fairly well if you wanted to work in your own fruit base.  I think dialing in the percentages to step back from the worst of that bitterness might be a chore though.\n\nDoesn't seem like a good choice for creams, custards, or bakeries.  Those bitter notes would probably fit in with a tobacco fairly well though.\n\n**Second Opinions:** [Here's the product page from Vape Train.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Vape Train Devon Cream, 1%, 4% and 8%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 41 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Thick full cream, with a not insignificant amount of cocoa and some lemon.\n\nSo, devon cream is basically just a clotted cream with an absurdly high milkfat percentage, and this mostly delivers.  Thick, full mouthfeel.  Fairly authentic, slightly sour dairy notes.  This is pretty well steeped by this point, but the dairy notes don’t taste too butyric or funky.  Seems like a pretty authentic sweeter cream.  Moderate, warm buttery richness to the vape.  Slightly sweet, but nothing that really pulls if off a cream profile.\n\nBut there’s some chocolate to this.  Feels a bit too pleasant to call it an off flavor, but I’m not sure it’s supposed to be here.  Tastes like a pretty middle of the road cocoa flavor, but the richness and sweetness of the cream flavor is giving this a bit of milk chocolate vibe. Not an overwhelming chocolate, but it shows up pretty clearly in mixes.  I get it the most on the back half of the exhale, and seems to linger with those dairy notes.    Fairly light straight vanilla taste, but It may be getting lost in the chocolate here.  The thicker, richer dairy and those cocoa notes actually come across a lot like a chocolate milkshake, but there is an odd sort of tartness to it.\n\nBeyond the cream and the chocolate, I think I also get a bit of lemon.  Seems show up both mixed low before the cream really fills out, and then comes back again at higher percentages. Kind of reminds me of that lemon-y note in FA Custard.  It’s not unpleasant or a super aggressive pledge type lemon, but it’s noticeable at 4% and ramps up a bit from there.  \n\n**Off-Flavors:**  Fairly prominent chocolate accent. Something lemony at higher percentages.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Nah, really smooth overall.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 1%,  this is still relatively fulls but the flavor seems a bit muted. Lighter cream, decent amount of cocoa and that lemony tartness.\n\nAt 4%, this is working pretty well.  Feels thick, those cream notes are coming through pretty clearly.  Cocoa isn’t completely overbearing but it’s definitely there.  Lemon seems like the most manageable here.\n\nAt 8%,  nothing really off but doesn’t feel that much thicker or richer than 8%.  Maybe a bit more chocolate, and that lemon has come back around for me.\n\nVape train suggests mixing with this at 5-10%.  That’s probably on the high end for me.  Just based on these tests, I’d be around 5% with this as a primary flavor, but this could actually work as an accent or basic thick texturizer around 2%.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This is a really solid flavor but it may end up being a fairly specialized tool. This isn’t just a straight cream base and I don’t think you’ll be able to really mix around that chocolate kind of note and you’ll have to watch out for that lemon tartness.\n\nWithout that tartness, I’d say this is already most of the way to a chocolate milkshake.  It could use a bit of maltiness from a low percentage of FW Hazelnut or something, but it’s really close.  But then that lemon kind of smacks me in the face a little bit.\n\nYou could kind of deal with that lemony thing by adding a fresher brighter fruit like berries that won’t completely clash with a chocolate. \n\nI don’t know, maybe y’all will get less chocolate than I do.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  Not much out there through the google machine.\n\n[Here is the product page from Vape Train.  Their description: “a thick, buttery cream that’s slightly sweet and perfect for your next e-liquid recipes. This flavour can add a creamy note that’s buttery with a consistency similar to soft butter. You could find yourself adding these to bakery & dessert style recipes that require a more of a buttery yet creamy texture of that found in a devonshire clotted cream.”  But cocoa, bruh.](https://www.vapetrain.com.au/shop/vt-concentrates/devon-cream-flavour-concentrate-diy-for-e-juice-recipe/)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Vape Train Fuji Red Apple, 1%, 4% and 8%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 41 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Sort of candied take on a red apple, but slightly fancy.  Like there may have been some actual apple juice involved at some point.  Feels pretty distinctly red, more red delicious than an actual fuji. Flat candied apple flavor, nothing that feels particularly realistic.\n\nTexturally, this is interesting.  It definitely doesn’t feel particularly juicy or fleshy.  Actual feels a bit dry, but it’s relatively thick.  Manages to avoid tasting like straight apple peels, which is kind of an issue with drier apple flavors.  Maybe tastes a bit flat, with that heavier base without too much vibrant in the top notes, but that could be a function of a relatively long steep.  A sweeter flavor overall, but stops just a bit short of being overwhelming or cloying.  Fairly accurate apple candy type of sweetness.\n\nSo comparing this to the other Fuji apples, I think this ends up being significantly different.  It has some of the juice of the CAP Fuji Apple, but in general this is less realistic than those.  Feels more like a generic red apple kind of flavor.  Probably closest to something like CAP Double Apple.  I feel like the Double Apple has a bit fleshier of a texture to it, but they both have that stronger candy apple vibe.\n\n**Off-Flavors:**  More of a candied take than the other fuji apples, but nothing unpleasant or odd.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light.  Pretty mellow for a candied fruit flavor overall.  Can get a bit dry at lower percentages, but seems to fill in and smooth out up higher.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 1%, this is basically vg with a light apple scent to it.  Seems way too weak down here.\n\nAt 4%, this is sort of thin, dry, and sweet.  Decent candy red apple flavor, but just doesn’t have much in the way of body or presence.\n\nAt 8%, this is working fairly well. Moderately dense apple base, although I’m not getting too much vibrancy in top notes.  Sweet but not quite obnoxious.  No real off flavors, feels like it could go a bit higher if you wanted to push it.\n\nVape Train suggests mixing with this at 3-5% or standalone at 7-12%.  Sure, why not?  Doesn’t seem like an especially aggressive flavor and not I’m getting anything off at higher percentages.  Just based on these tests, I’d be around 4% as an accent and up to 10% as a primary flavor.  Feels a bit dry for a solo flavor, but you could probably do worse for a single apple.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I’d use this more like the aforementioned CAP Double Apple than trying to work this in as a realistic apple flavor.\n\nReminds me a lot of manzanita del sol apple soda, and could be used over a juicier, relatively neutral fruit like CAP Fuji Apple or FA Pear to go after that apple soda kind of profile.\n\nI’d use it up against other fruits mostly, although it wouldn’t be bad in a cream or something when you’re looking for a relatively punchy candy apple flavor.  Should pair well with the usual suspects like watermelon, blueberry, and tarter stuff like pineapples.\n\nFeels a bit candied for bakeries in general.  Could be interesting as a shisha type apple flavoring in tobaccos.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  Not much on the google.\n\n[Here is the product page from Vape Train.  Their description: “an apple flavour similar to that of a cold pressed bold crisp apple juice. It’s mildly sweet without tartness or sourness found in VTA Green Apple. This flavour blends smoothly with other fruits to lift sweetness and is generally considered to be used as a prominent flavour that will stand out in your recipe among other fruit flavours.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Vape Train Golden Syrup, 1%, 4% and 8%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 43 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Based on a lightly caramelized invert sugar syrup.  Like pancake syrup without the maple flavoring, basically.\n\nSeems pretty accurate, at least to the homemade version I tried.  Mostly just sweet, but with a bit of a deep caramel warmth.  Nothing too heavily toasted or burnt, and manages to avoid that soapy caramel off-note you’ll get with a harder caramel like FA.  Some fairly light buttery richness here, but nothing like a full on caramel sauce.  Tastes maybe just a bit malty, but it’s pretty subtle.  No other weird bakery flavors sticking out, tastes like their could be a really slight amount of vanilla in here but if it’s there it works pretty cohesively with the flavor without calling attention to itself.\n\nPretty heavily sweet flavor overall, which makes sense.  Moderate thickness and the mouthfeel does, in fact, feel like a syrup.  Not really watery, but it does kind of feel like a liquid type of sweetness as opposed to a dry, solid block of sugar.  Seems to vape a bit warm, but nothing that is really interfering with the flavor.  Not really relevant, but very sweet room note.  Smells like I was vaping some Aunt Jemima’s after walking back into the room. \n\nFor a sweet flavor, seems pretty easy on the coils.  I went through about 15ml of this on the same wicks and coils.  The wicks got maybe a bit crunchy, but nothing really burnt.  Just for laughs, I dry burned the coils off and didn’t see any heavy coil gunk burning off, so if there is a sweetener in here it’s at least not crazy heavy on sucralose.\n\n**Off-Flavors:**  Nah, nothing seems off here.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light, mostly at higher percentages.  Seems to dry out a bit for me with extended vaping solo, but that is probably not going to be anyone’s preferred application.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 1%, sweet, but not much nuance.  Maybe a tiny bit of that darker caramelized note but pretty light overall.  Fairly nondescript here. \n\nAt 4%,  this is basically dead on profile.  Sweet, warm, mildly caramelized, and just a bit buttery.  Texture feels syrupy.\n\nAt 8%,  even sweeter and a bit dry.  Doesn’t seem to bring any additional nuance over 4%.\n\nVape train suggests mixing with this at 1-5% or 5-9%.  I can’t really come up with a good reason to vape this standalone… but the mixing percentages pretty much cover it.  Just based on these tests, I’d probably start around 1% for this as mostly a sweetener, and go up to 3-4% as a syrup or distinct flavor.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Should be a pretty good catch-all base for various dark sweeteners.  Not as dark as molasses, but not as plain as corn syrup or straight white syrup.\n\nPancake syrup sort of tastes like maple, but is pretty much just high fructose corn syrup. Kopel used this a pancake syrup with his [Flapjacks! recipe](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/87222#flapjacks_by_kopel)  I’d probably still add some maple to it, but it seems to have worked for him there. \n\nBy itself, this would make a decent stand-in for a malt syrup.  Adding some NF Malt to this would be even more better.   Could also work as a darker sweetness like rice bran syrup or maybe even a really light molasses.\n\nGood filler agent in bakery applications that involve a filling really high in karo syrup like pecan pie or a chess pie.  Probably a fairly good sweetener for drier profiles like bakeries or tobaccos in general.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  [Kopel left some notes in that aforementioned flapjacks recipe: “This is the real star of the show. It's thick, got a great sweetness to it, and it adds a beautiful butter texture that I don't think I've found anywhere else. It really reminds me of that bite from the middle of the pancake where the butter and syrup sat there together for awhile. There's no maple here, just gooey buttery sweetness that is really addicting.”](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/87222#flapjacks_by_kopel)\n\n[No description, but here’s the product page from Vape Train.](https://www.vapetrain.com.au/shop/vt-concentrates/golden-syrup-flavour-concentrate-diy-for-e-liquid-recipe/)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

I love grapefruit irl. Like I REALLY love it. I like to just slice it in half with the rind and dig in like some filthy animal. Lather it in super spicy sauce, lick it, juice it, mix it with ginger, peel it from the skin and eat the flesh then suck on the skin, munch on the skin, eat it like an orange, I LOVE GRAPEFRUIT! I fucking love how BITTER it gets when eaten with the skin, I love the flesh with some super spicy sauce and dips, I love how the rind makes my lips go numb, I love the smell of it, I really REALLY love it. I love how grapefruit juice tastes like, I love it with ginger, with carrots, with whatever just juicy delicious bitter and absolutely pleasant. God DAMN I LOVE GRAPEFRUIT. \n\nBut Christ almighty I've not found a good grapefruit flavour so fml right? I mean Pink Guava by FLV exists which is alright-ish but it's mostly the flesh. And then I saw VTA's Grapefruit while buying my recent flavours and I got such a massive boner thinking it's gonna be as authentic as humanly possible to achieve. \n\nAnd damn it comes close but eh not there yet, BUT SO CLOSE.\n\nTested @3% and 7% on Zenith 0.8 Kanthal coils, steeped 5 days and tested a fresh batch and no steep changes to be noticed so blah blah. \n\nThe 3% is very nice to vape, but loses my interest super quickly. It's just... there I guess. Add it only as a side aroma/side taste, but don't expect it to \"shine\" or something, it will add a bit of shape to your citrus mixes but that's about it. Just a nice sharp high note basically. Nice smell too, all of my recent VTA batch has a nice smell and I'm really happy I don't get to blow some super artificial smells this past week. \n\n7% is where this shines tho. Or around 7% I guess. Depends on what bitterness you like because BOYYYY this is bitter, oh so bitter, holy shit I love how bitter it is. Maybe I'm conditioned to feel this now, but I swear I felt my lips numb a bit from it...  \n\nAt 7% VTA's Grapefruit behaves like the skin towards the rind of a grapefruit, same taste as the bitter flesh there, same feeling, same aroma! Damn, it feels super clean and nice to vape. I just LOVE bitterness tho, so be warned that this might not be for everyone! \n\nIt issss missing the fleshy part of the grapefruit, the one which exists to hold all the flavour of the grapefruit ykno. The centerpiece without any of the skin, the dissected heart of the grapefruit. A massive letdown for me, since I really wanted to have this baby as a standalone grapefruit vape. I guess mixing it with some Pink Guava or any guava at all will work to give it plenty of fleshiness and body. But as it stands on its own it's a bit of a disappointment... \n\nWorth it? If you like grapefruit and love bitterness, absolutely. Mix recommendations? Eh citrus, lemons, oranges, guavas, something with a more earthy body/flesh since this is what's missing here. \n\nStaple? Nah. Must have? Definitely not. Enjoyable? Absolutely! \n\nOne last review coming tomorrow and I'm very excited to try this flavour!",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Vape Train Green Mango, 1%, 4% and 8%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 44 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Hey, so you know that green mango peel note that everyone is always complaining about with mango flavors? That’s pretty much what this is.  It’s a very piney, slightly sweet and tart, underripe mango with a distinct basil accent.\n\nThe top notes here are really piney and remind me of the terpenes from hops or their really close and very popular botanical cousin.  Fairly accurate to a green mango although those piney top notes are maybe just a bit more prominent then they would be in a green mango.   Definitely tastes green and fresh though.  Light fresh cut grass underneath it all.  There also seems to be a thai basil kind of flavor that really shows up on the tail end of the exhale.  A little sharper and more anise-y than sweet basil.  It could just be flavor association from mostly eating green mango in thai restaurants, but it seems to be pretty dead on to thai basil for me. Less peppery than holy basil, but still has a really interesting presence to it.\n\nThe base of this is a pretty heavily tart mango flavor.  Still some of that sweetness, but not nearly as sweet and thick as you get from something like FLV Mango.   Tartness actually seems have a bit of astringency attached to it as well.  That mango lends some extra body and sweetness to those pine and basil herbal notes.  Feels fairly crisp and slightly juicy.   I could be losing my mind, but I’m also getting some of that underripe mango chalkiness here too.\n\nAnd it’s not really a deal-breaker or anything, but my testers with this are really cloudy, so maybe don’t be surprised about that.\n\n**Off-Flavors:**  Well, it’s a green mango so caveat emptor.  Seems to have a pretty heavy basil hit to it though.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light.  Pretty smooth overall, at least steeped this long.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 1%, I’m getting a pretty heavy tartness out this.  Seems to be a bit more versatile here, with the pinier notes a bit more toned down. Definitely still there, and I’m still getting some basil, but might be workable without calling too much attention to itself here. \n\nAt 4%, that tartness is more balanced out by sweetness. Relatively heavy piney and basil notes.  Pretty unmistakable here.\n\nAt 8%, there isn’t anything unpleasant tasting, but those piney notes and especially the basil is getting pretty aggressive.  Doesn’t feel like much more mango base than 4%.\n\nVape Train again suggests mixing this at 1-5% or standalone 5-9%.  Just based on these tests, I’d use this lower as a relatively onubtrusive accent from .5-2%.  If you really wanted to lean into the green mango here, I’d probably start around 6% for a primary flavor.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Overall a really well done, but fairly left field flavor that is probably going to be  exactly what a small percentage of people are looking for.\n\nSo, if you were let down by decidedly undank TPA Mary Jane or the more juniper heavy FA Reggae Nights, this may actually be a pretty viable alternative.  Still feels a bit grassy and fresh, but that terpene top note is at least moderately dank. \n\nIf you’re just a fan of herbal or hop flavors, this could provide some really interesting backup for FLV Pink Guava or FLV Yakima Hops.  The tropical fruit notes would work really well FLV Pink Guava, and this could bend the more straight ahead Yakima Hops into something a bit fruity like a citra, simcoe, or cascade hops.\n\nYou could always pair this with more mango if for some reason your mango doesn’t have enough peel on it, but should be interesting with apple,  cherimoya, grapefruit, guava, and pineapple.  Probably easier to bounce this off sweet juicy fruits.  If you can deal with the pine, the basil here would work really well with strawberries and that tartness would just bump the entire profile up a notch.\n\nThis is going to be a bit unpleasant with anything involving dairy notes,  not so much because of the pine kind of thing but also because the underlying grassy basil flavor… but feel free to add some coconut if you want to roll with that creamier, richer take.\n\nOr hey, get weird with it and break out some FE Sweet Rice or something spicy.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  I’m not seeing anything via google.\n\n[Here’s the product page from Vape Train.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Vape Train Guava, 1%, 4% and 8%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 10 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Lightly funky and musky realistic guava with a sweeter guava nectar type body.\n\nGuava here tries to split the difference between sweet nectar and an actual fruit.  The base of the flavor is relatively full and definitely has some of that sticky, full guava nectar type of body.  Some light tartness helps set offset some of the heaviness, but still feels more like nectar.  Not as full-on hawaiian punch \"red\" as some of the other guava options, and some fresher guava type top notes.  My big dumb 'murican palate reads this as sort of papaya-esque, with a softer, warmer tropical fleshy kind of vibe.\n\nThe guava here is fairly musky.  The room note is honestly just a bit strange, but there's nothing really offensive when you're vaping it.  Light kind of ammonia vibe, but nowhere near as obnoxious as TPA Guava.  Ripe tropical fruit kind of musk, can stick out a bit in busier mixes  At higher percentages, starts to pick up a sort of vegetal finish.  Somewhere between a piney mango peel and some of the muddy green notes on the end of passion fruit flavors. I almost pick up a bit of a minty cooling at 8%.  Overall the off-notes are present, but not completely overbearing.\n\nModerately full mouthfeel here.  Gets thick and a bit sticky at higher percentages.  Almost has a light gelatin or gummy vibe closer to 8%.  Fairly full-bodied sweetness.  Not overtly candied, but the sweetness level feels closer to a guava nectar, and the tartness here doesn't quite cut through those heavier sticky sweet notes.\n\nMy benchmark guavas are pretty much CAP Sweet Guava and FLV Pink Guava.  This is definitely more realistic than CAP Sweet Guava, with a heavier musk and some funkier ripe guava notes.  I'd say it mostly leans toward the same profile though, both having those heavier, sweeter guava nectar type notes.  The top end of the VT Guava seems maybe a little more flat and less interesting than the terpene-ish citrus hops thing that FLV Pink Guava brings to the table, but the base on this is definitely sweeter and thicker.\n\n**Off-Flavors:**  Musky but not overbearing, probably a fit for the profile. Picks up some vegetal, almost cooling muddiness at higher percentages.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light to moderate.  Seems maybe a bit harsher than CAP Sweet Guava (if the maltol there doesn't bug you) but not as harsh as something like FA Guava.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 1%,  this doesn't really feel solid enough for me.  It's a lighter flavor, with some guava sweetness, but it doesn't feel all that rich and filled in.  I'm still getting a bit of raw vg.\n\nAt 4%,  this has filled in quite a bit. Feels fleshier, maybe a bit too thick to really feel juicy. Guava flavor is definitely heavier and sweeter than at 1%. Lighter muskiness and a bit of tartness that helps to freshen up the thicker base.\n\nAt 8%,  the actual guava here doesn't seem that different from 4%.  Stickier mouthfeel and feels heavier and warmer.  That musk is picking up, and I'm getting that sort vegetal finish.\n\nI'm fairly new to this line, so I cast a wide net with these testers.  [Vape Train suggests a pretty wide range of \"Mixed 3-7% - Standalone 5-8%.\"](https://www.vapetrain.com.au/shop/flavour-concentrates/vt-concentrates/guava-flavour-concentrate-diy-for-e-juice-recipe/)  Just based on these tests, I think that's in the ballpark.  I'd probably be on the low side of those recommendations, like 3% as an accent or 5-6% as a primary flavor.  The core guava works okay at higher percentages, but the off notes start to pick up and get a bit weird at the high end.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Pretty standard guava pairings.  Should work well with stawberries or other tropical fruits.  I'd be looking for something a bit brighter like passion fruit or pineapple, as the body on this already leans a bit heavy and sticky. \n\nWith the passion fruit thing said, I don't think this is the best option for a Pog Guava.  I could see the stickiness of this flavor sort of amplifying the waxy thing that most orange flavors already have going on.  I'd stick to zestier limes or grapefruits if you wanted to pair with citrus.\n\nProbably not the best choice for creams or custards, as those musky notes are going to stand out against a flatter, neutral base.\n\nWould work well in guava cocktail or beverage profiles.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  I can't find anything solid out there.\n\n[Here's the product page from Vape Train Australia.  Their description: \"a luscious sweet guava flavour that’s refreshing to use in many fruit mixes, pairs perfectly with our shisha strawberry, shisha mango and various other fruits.\"](https://www.vapetrain.com.au/shop/flavour-concentrates/vt-concentrates/guava-flavour-concentrate-diy-for-e-juice-recipe/)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Vape Train Honey Pomelo, 3% and 7%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 21 days.\n**Flavor Description:**  Like a pomelo, but sweeter.\n\nThe pomelo here seems fairly accurate overall.  Starts off as a sweeter take on a white grapefruit, with some moderately aggressive lime notes creeping into the top end on the exhale.  The body of the flavor is heavy and sweet, bordering on syrupy.  Gets maybe a bit oversweet and cloying solo, but it’s balanced fairly well by some tartness.  Not as tart as something like INW White Grapefruit or FA Grapefruit for me, but there is enough acidity to do the citrus thing well enough. I’m not really picking up anything too bitter here, but there is just a bit of a zest note going on as well.\n\nDoesn’t have that really heavy waxy note I usually get with thicker citrus flavors, so that’s cool. Overall, harshness is pretty decent for a ctirus. Base of the flavor feels more candied than juicy, and that sweetness can get a bit dry with extended vaping.  Something about the combination of lime and grapefruit can come across a bit like a cleaning product though, at least at higher percentages.\n\nThe only other pomelo flavor I’ve tried is Purilum Pomelo, and this seems to be a bit more useful.  I’d almost call the Purilum a bit more realistic, but this is brighter, fuller, and doesn’t have the weird musk of the Purilum.\n\n**Off-Flavors:**  Can get a bit of a cleaning product vibe solo, but pomelos kind of have that going on.  So not really?\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light to Moderate.  It’s there, but it’s relatively mellow for a citrus that is actually bright.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 3%, this is a bright, lighter take on a sweet citrus.  Doesn’t really read distinctly as a pomelo here, feels a bit more like a more generic citrus mix.  Not particularly harsh while still being fairly vibrant.\n\nAt 7%, this is a pomelo.  Something about the component citrus parts has cohered a bit and I’m getting a clear pomelo.   Still not super harsh, a touch acidic, and pretty bright overall.  Feels sweet and saturated, although it’s starting to taste a bit like a cleaning product.\n\nVape Train suggests mixing with this at 2-4%, and solo from 5-7%.  That actually seems about right.  Just based on these tests, I think I’d be around 1-2% as an accent or 5-6% as a primary note.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  As an accent, this is going to be a pretty good general purpose citrus that has some sweetness, body, and brightness.  Should stand up well in most fruit mixes and work as “citrus” to play off most anything you want to bounce off of it.  \n\nSeems the most like a grapefruit, so you may be able to use it in conjunction with a more zest heavy grapefruit to fill out a grapefruit vape without the overall mix being super aggressive.\n\nAt higher percentages, it’s a strong and relatively clean citrus flavor, but it’s a bit harder to get away from that industrial vibe.  As a primary flavor, I’d aim more at beverages or candies, where those lime notes aren’t going to drag a mix into tasting like cleaning products.\n\nI’d probably stay away from anything dairy-ish just because of those vaguely astringent lime notes going on in the top end.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  [One note on ELR from user “ChrisBeanColes” who writes: “Wonderful flavour. Can taste elements of many citrus fruits in one. Grapefruit, lime lemon. Hard to explain. Very tasty, no citrus harshness and no cloudiness to the liquid. Had steeped 11 days before I tried it as I'd mixed a lot of single flavour testers. Have only mixed at 6% so far. Would not need to go higher as a single flavour. Could probably go lower. Seems a fairly sweet flavour without being a sugar lips. Will see a lot of use I think.”](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/198482)\n\n[Here’s the product page from Vape Train.  Their description: “a delicious citrus fruit that is similar to grapefruit without the bitterness or sour flavour. Honey Pomelo pairs with lime, coconut and pomegranate and other citrus fruits. You could also make use of this in your cold beverage range and cocktail style liquids for making pink lemonade or adding to any ejuice recipes that require an uplifting freshness of flavour. This flavour also works perfectly on its own in a single profile mix.”](https://www.vapetrain.com.au/shop/vt-concentrates/honey-pomelo-flavour-concentrate-diy-for-e-juice-recipe/)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Medium bodied mouthfeel.\n\n**7%** Bakery notes are more at the front now. Still got some buttery sweetness. The harshness is no worse than it was at 6%.\n\n**Final Thoughts:** VTA's suggested percentages seem about right to me. I didn't get any werid off notes. Did get the slightest bit of harshness the higher i pushed it. This should have a wide range of useages in just about any bakery recipe. Although i didn't get any distinct honey flavor, so if you are looking to use it for a honey note in a recipe you will have to look elsewhere. This should pair up nicely with FLV milk & honey to give that honey note though. This at a fairly medium body mouthfeel at all the percentages i tested it. All & all this is a pretty solid flavor & made a pleasant single flavor vape. \n",

    "markdown": "This stuff smells like a pig's anus. It instantly made me gag. What the flying fuck is that stench! I really wanted to discard it, I don't know what made me say \"yeah this sounds interesting and there aren't any reviews might as well give it a shot, who knows I might be the first person in the world to try it\" and I hope I am because this smell should be banned. \n\nNow honestly, jackfruit when ripened/cooked doesn't smell nice too. It smells like shit. But this is concentrated, focused on bringing down your self esteem and making you give a pig a rimjob. It's not good at all. \n\nI learned a while ago not to judge by smell however. It's a bit like with some eastern cuisine, it might smell absurd and horrid to a person who doesn't know what's coming, but once you have it in your mouth you're absolutely in awe at how amazing it is. \n\nThis was quite the journey which almost made me puke and my stomach is still upside down when I think about my first toke of Jackfruit and how much it improved afterwards.\n\nTested on Falcon King, bamboo fiber, 75w M1+ coils yada yada.\n\n1% flavour, SNV, steeped a day, steeped 3 days, mixed.\n\nHonestly, it doesn't change with steeping, just the smell sort of goes in the background. Fancy!\n\nThe inhale is one of the best feelings I've had in my entire life. I don't know what those (definitely) crazy people over at VTA are doing but holy shit it's insanely good how well this feels to vape. It's a nice solid thick throat hit which sort of lingers in the upper back of your throat without itching or feeling uncomfortable. The inhale itself carries a nice, pleasant taste, very exotic, very comforting in a way. Think of how the aftertaste of the outside of a pineapple feels like aftertaste wise and you can sort of feel it. It's nice, subtle, sweet (even sweeter since I vape 80% vg), just all round super pleasant. My tongue was tingling in such a fascinating way it was almost magical. And the best part is how this feeling persevered during the slight steep I gave it. It never changed. \n\nThe exhale can go fuck itself though, it's literally like I'm giving reverse birth to a shit-smeared pig. It's horrendous. Imagine eating vegan pulled pork made with jackfruit instead of pig (it's a real thing and it's delicious) and puking it out, that's how it feels, fuck that exhale. It made me gag so many times but I needed to persevere in order to provide information to the community which gave me so much.\n\nThere's an additional review over at Chef's Flavours [here](https://chefsflavours.co.uk/blog/jack-fruit-vta-flavour-notes/). Shame that whoever wrote it didn't proceed to mix it up with some other flavours because this is where this flavours shine. \n\nYou NEED something to fix the exhale's sharp notes. I personally used CAP Double Apple at 4% but any apple/kiwi or anything with a dominant sharp note will fix it. And holy shit it's absolutely amazing. Think of VTA's Jackfruit as if it's that one awesome postman, the perfect delivery man who knocks on your door/rings the bell and waits patiently for you, smiles at you despite you being 2-3 mins late to the door still in your pjs and messy hair and wishes you an amazing day. It is thick, it is perfectly juicy without any super thick and syrupy feelings (looking at you INW Cactus SNV), it's just amazing. And now that the high notes of the exhale are covered by the apple (or whatever you prefer to fix those notes) it's absolutely genius. \n\nI went through a good 30ml in one day just like that, it's addicting. I'd recommend pairing it either with sharper notes for thickness and juiciness and that amazing inhale, or going with some not so juicy exotic tastes (INW Pineapple comes to mind). Hell, you can even go further with a succulent pulled pork recipe if that's what you fancy with some cinnamon and mango. There are just so many options once you adjust that exhale note that it's crazy. \n\nI wouldn't vape it as a standalone tho. Absolutely not. That exhale is gag inducing on its own and the smell is absurdly bad as expected from a ripened fruit like this one. But hot damn is this amazing. Great job VTA.\n\nP.S: Recommend it at 0.5% for less intense/dominant fruits, 1% for sharper more sour fruits\n\nP.P.S: [The recipe I used to make it awesome](https://e-liquid-recipes.com/recipe/3381942/Apples+and+pig%2527s+ass)",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Vape Train Juicy Raspberry, 3% and 7%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 14 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  A floral raspberry with some juicy tendencies.\n\nFloral heavy raspberry.  Typical perfume-type berry floral all up in the top notes.  Florals stick around throughout the entire vape and end up being very prominent in the exhale.  More floral than the top end of something like FA Raspberry, but less floral than FA Blackberry… so that’s something.   \n\nThe floral here is a bummer, because the raspberry underneath it is pretty solid.  Moderately dense, with a deeply juicy base.  Full, realistic raspberry flavor.  Maybe a bit sweeter than a straight raspberry, but doesn’t feel too candied or artificial. Nice balance of tarter brightness and deeper sweet berry notes.  Feels very vivid and red.\n\nMouthfeel overall is juicy in the base, especially on the inhale, but dries out from those florals up top.  \n\n**Off-Flavors:**  Pretty solidly floral and perfumey.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Moderate. The body of the flavor is pretty mellow, but those florals get a bit harsh.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 3%,  the florals here are still pretty intense.  Raspberry is moderately juicy, but seems a bit undersaturated.  What I can taste of the raspberry here is fairly realistic, but seems a bit lost.\n\nAt 7%,  that’s a really aggressive floral.  Raspberry is sweet and bright, with a juicier base.  But yeah, floral.\n\nVape Train suggests mixing between 1-3% and standalone from 3-5% so I’m guessing someone noticed the floral thing.  Just based on these tests, I’d be going lower with this as an accent, somewhere between 1-2%.  Cutting back one of my testers to about 1%, that floral is still there but not completely overwhelming, and some of that juicier mouthfeel is still coming through.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This one might be a bit tricky to get right.  There is a decent, juicy raspberry here but it’s a bit swamped by those florals.  My best guess would be trying to use this underneath a brighter, candied berry flavor to add some juiciness and realism.   I’d pick something like FW Razzleberry, FLV Boysenberry, or TPA Sweet Raspberry.  Anything that already has a floral note is going to be difficult to make worth with this.\n\nAlternatively, this could be used in fruit mixes at that same accent percentage to add a hint of raspberry.  Again, big bright fruit flavors without floral notes are going to be you’re friend.  I’d look at guava, kiwi, or strawberry.\n\nCooling can help clean up floral notes a little bit, so a colder mix would probably be better.  Florals also  hide a bit when introduced to aggressive alcohol flavors, so maybe throw it in a cocktail? Should do a decent job of a muddled raspberry.\n\nToo floral to really recommend with creams, custards, or bakeries.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  I’m not really seeing anything out there via google.\n\n[No description, but here is the product page from Vape Train.](https://www.vapetrain.com.au/shop/vt-concentrates/juicy-raspberry-flavour-concentrate-diy-for-e-liquid-recipe/)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Vape Train Kiwi, 1%, 4% and 8%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 14 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Realistic kiwi with a light musk on the tail end.\n\nPretty standard kiwi here. Somewhere between a sweeter melon flavor and a green strawberry.  Tastes realistic without going too far in the astringent, peelish kind of direction.  Sweeter base, with a light tartness offsetting some of the sweetness.  Feels fairly balanced for an actual fruit.\n\nSeems to be something a little floral on the tail.  Less of a perfumey bitter floral like you'd get with berries, but a slightly deeper melon kind of musk.  Kind of takes a while to find while you're vaping, but noticeable once you pick it up.  I'd call it light and not overwhelming, and again, only really seems to factor in on the tail end of the exhale.\n\nModerate density here.  Doesn't quite feel juicy, but it's not dry.  Doesn't have a really heavy candy syrup kind of vibe.  Could probably pass as a bit fleshy.  Sweetness here feels pretty dead on to an actual kiwi, instead of a deeper candy type.\n\nSo, how this stack up next to the dual elephants in the room, FA and FW Kiwi?  I'm glad you asked.  I have prepared for this question.  I'd say it's probably closer to FW Kiwi.  To me, FA Kiwi has this thing that tastes like it's halfway to a brighter kiwi-strawberry already, and I'm picking up less of those candyish strawberry notes on the VT version.  Seems to be lacking some of the harder tartness of the FA version as well.  This maybe tastes like a less sweet, slightly more natural version of the (non-natural) FW to me.  It has that same fairly realistic kiwi fruit taste, without that really heavy candy base. The VT version seems just a hair more floral or musky to me as well, which I guess kind of adds to the realism next to the sweeter FW?\n\n**Off-Flavors:**  Light floral musk, shows up by 4%, present but not overwhelming at 8%.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Not really? Maybe a light throat hit but mellow for a fruit.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 1%, I'm getting a fairly clear, but very light kiwi.  Tastes soft but realistic.\n\nAt 4%, this definitely a kiwi flavor, but it's just a bit thin.  Some of the tarter notes are coming through without much of a heavier, sweet base.  Just a tiny bit of muskiness on the finish.\n\nAt 8%, the actual kiwi flavor here is fine.  It's fairly full and realistic, and more fruit than candy sweet.  I am noticing that muskiness a bit more.\n\n[Vape Train suggests mixing with this at 3-7% or standalone at 5-10%. Just based on these tests, they probably aren't wrong.](https://www.vapetrain.com.au/shop/vt-concentrates/kiwi-flavour-concentrate-diy-for-e-juice-recipe/)  I feel like it gets just a bit musky at the higher end of that, but it's not offensive and probably easy enough to hide a bit.  I'd probably be close to 5% as an accent and 8% as a primary note.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  If this was your only kiwi, I would reasonably expect it to do pretty much whatever you want a kiwi to do.  Staple ingredient in fruit mixes, mixes well strawberries and tropical fruit.  Tastes just exotic enough but pretty non-threatening.\n\nLooking more for the specific things this Kiwi would do better than other available options, I feel like this is a slightly less candied and more realistic take.\n\nSeems like a good fit for more \"natural\" fruit profiles, like smoothies or light to medium creams.\n\nI don't really know any bakery profiles that use kiwi beyond some pavlovas, but this would work in that kind of application.  Should work pretty well for a realistic kiwi in a cheesecake or something like that as well.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  Not finding much out there.\n\n[Here's the product page from Vape Train.  Probably worth noting my bottle technically says \"Kiwi Fruit\" but they've got just the one Kiwi... so I'm guessing it's this one.  Their description: \" Kiwi is the juice company’s secret weapon when to comes to making fruit flavours pop. This flavour is absolutely outstanding as a mixer for strawberry and other citrus fruit.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Vape Train Light Rum, 1%, 4% and 8%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 18 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  A rum top note, but actually boozy.\n\nThe rum here feels maybe a bit darker and sweeter than a white rum.  I'd probably call it a golden rum or repasado if you're feeling fancy.  There's a lighter fruity caramel type note as opposed to just hot booze like you'd get with a real light rum.  Again, getting fancy, I'd try to spin as something like a sherry cask age as that fruitiness definitely has something vaguely grape-ish to it.  Actually has a moderate booziness, giving a pretty clear impression of an alcohol while not being particularly aggressive.\n\nRelatively top heavy flavor, with a whole lot more going on in the top notes than in the base of the flavor. Some sweeter, lightly caramel type body here but it's pretty thin.  Even at higher percentages, I'm still getting some of my testing mix coming through.  Kind of unsatisfying as a single flavor rum vape.\n\nFairly thin overall, and you really only get some of those hotter rum notes and some sweetness in mixes.  While not cloying by itself, it will definitely sweeten up a mix.\n\n**Off-Flavors:**  Not a bunch of body here, maybe a bit sweet for a light rum.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Moderate, but it's a booze and feels pretty appropriate.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 1%, this isn't really working for me.  More light, sweet fruitiness than a distinct rum note.  Very thin.\n\nAt 4%, I'm getting a pretty solid sweet rum top note.  Lightly fruity, with a light caramel body.  Tastes boozy.\n\nAt 8% I'm really not getting any more booze than 4%.  The body is just a bit thicker, but still feels a bit undersaturated and thin.\n\nVape Train suggests mixing with this at 2-5% and using it standalone from 5-9%. Just based on these tests, I'd probably be using this around 4-5%.  I'm not really getting a fuller rum or more satisfying booze effect than that higher.  Definitely an accent flavor as a solo rum.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Without any backup, this comes across like a splash of a fairly mellow rum in a cocktail mix.  Using just the light rum, I'd wager you could get pretty close to a rum and coke or mojito where the rum isn't really being pushed around by super aggressive fruity flavors.\n\nYou know that thing where FA Jamaican Rum is delicious but not really boozy?  Yeah, this fixes that.  All of the rum's I've tried so far don't really have a pronounced booziness.  This does, and it pretty much slots on top of darker, heavier rum flavors if thats your thing.  Seriously, 4% of this on top of 2% FA Jamaican Rum and you're basically in cocktail town.  It may now be possible to make a boozy pina coloda.  We talking mai tais, dark and stormies, hurricanes, daquiris... really, the sky is the limit here in terms of cocktail applications.\n\nYou want to go darker? Like a spiced rum? Starting adding some TPA Brown Sugar or FLV Caramel for some extra sweetness and depth on top of that FA Jamaican Rum and start adding in whatever spices you dig like cloves, cinnamon, and some extra vanilla.  The hangover isn't included.\n\nI wouldn't really be using this outside of cocktail applications.  Most of the rum going into bakeries, custards, and candies has most of the booze driven off by heating... and there are better options for that.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Here's the product page from Vape Train.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Vape Train Macadamia Nut, 1%, 4% and 8%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 43 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Lightly nutty and creamy macadamia nut, with some cocoa and a little bit of playdough funkiness.\n\nThe nuttiness here is pretty mild. Doesn’t feel nearly as aggressive as some other nut flavors.  Maybe a bit nuttier than FA Almond but not quite as nutty as FW Hazelnut, just as a comparison.  Not the boldest flavor in general, but macadamia nuts aren’t a particularly aggressive nut, so that mostly checks out.  Not raw or green, but a relatively light roast to this.  Not a lot of of the warmer, crisper flavors you get from a harder roasted nut flavor.  Nuttiness feels a bit indistinct, I don’t think I’d be able to call out a macadamia nut if it wasn’t on the bottle.\n\nFeels a bit creamier than straight macadamia nuts.  Again, bringing up FA Almond, that same kind of creamier base. A bit sweetened, but nothing overbearing.  I’m picking up some occasional glazed donut type playdough flavor out of this, but it doesn’t seem out of control after this kind of steep.  Smells a bit more aggressive in the bottle, but settles down fairly well.  I notice mostly after I’m coming back to this flavor after taking a break.  I’m also getting a bit of a cocoa note here.  More subtle than the chocolate off-note in VT Devon Cream.  Not really unpleasant or clashing with the profile, but it’s going to be a lot easier to just go with it than try to mix around it.\n\n**Off-Flavors:**  A bit of that playdough-ish glazed donut flavor.  Some cocoa notes.  The actual nut here seems a bit lost in the creaminess.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Nah, feels pretty smooth overall.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 1%, this is pretty thin.  Really light nuttiness, some cocoa, and maybe some  kind of tartness.\n\nAt 4%, this feels quite a bit more solid. Relatively creamy overall, but light on the nuttiness. Cocoa is a bit more noticeable, and I get that really light playdough note.\n\nAt 8% that playdough kind of note isn’t overwhelming, but it’s definitely more present.  Still pretty smooth and creamy, more chocolate than nutty.\n\nVape Train suggests mixing with this at 1-5% or standalone from 5-9%.  Just based on these tests, that seems a bit high.  Feels like I’m getting about all I’m going to get out of this by 4%.  I’d probably start with this around 3% as an accent.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I’d basically use this as a cocoa-tinged version of FA Almond.  More used for thickness and creaminess, than the actual nutty notes.\n\nShould work fairly well in bakeries that have a chocolate component.  That cocoa note does show up in mixes, so I wouldn’t really fight it.\n\nWould also work well in a custard that can handle a bit of cocoa.\n\nI’ve been saying this a lot lately, but this could be really interesting in a tobacco.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  [Here’s the ELR page.  User “dameer.dj” writes: “Creamy. Creamy a lot! Tastes like some strange mix between honey and coconut in a good way (nature makes wonders tho). No nutty or earthy off-notes to it. Tasty and rich. I'd pair it with bakeries rather than other nuts or fruits. Slight vanilla in there, a little bit of pudding base too.”  Via google translate, user “PiriPiri” writes: “Mmm .... Macadamia Nut done right. Creamy, sweet, greasy and authentic. Flavor West's version was a flavor I had to throw, but this one is amazing. Mix with chocolate, baking, tobacco or coffee. However, it is quite weak even at 5%, I would probably stay there also in prescriptions.”  That’s a spicy take.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/234132)\n\n[No description, but here is the product page from Vape Train.](https://www.vapetrain.com.au/shop/vt-concentrates/macadamia-nut-flavour-concentrate-diy-for-e-liquid-recipe/)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Vape Train Mandarin, 3% and 7%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 21 days.\n**Flavor Description:**  The syrup from canned mandarins more than a fresh mandarin.\n\nBright mandarin flavor.  Seems a bit one-dimensional like the syrup from canned mandarins. Sweetness level isn’t quite candied, but it’s substantially sweeter than just peeled mandarins.  Relatively light bit of tartness giving it some balance.  I’m not picking up any real zest to this.  Nothing that really feels fresh or juicy.  Seems to have just a bit of an artificial tang type flavor underneath that brighter, tarter mandarin. Not straight tang, but tastes just a bit artificial.\n\nBase of the flavor seems a bit waxy, and it’s doing that thing where the first couple of drags off freshly dripped cotton are a whole lot more vibrant than the last couple where the wax comes out more.  Not as waxy as FA Mandarin, and doesn’t seem to have that sort of green muddiness that come can come along with the waxiness.  Gives this a moderately full body overall.\n\nSeems to have fallen off a bit with a steep.  This was a bit more vibrant at 1 and 2 weeks then it seems now. It’s not absolutely dramatic, but it seems a little less bright and a little more dull and waxy after 3 weeks.\n\nOut of the zoo of mandarins/tangerines that I’ve tried, this reminds the most of the midpoint between FE Sweet Orange and FA Mandarin.  It has that brighter but still kind of candied bright mandarin flavor like the FE Sweet Orange, but it has some of that heavier waxy body from FA Mandarin.\n\n**Off-Flavors:**  A little bit of wax, a little artificial tasting, definitely syrup instead of fresh mandarins.  Nothing unpleasant or completely off though.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light.  Pretty mellow for a citrus.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 3%,  I’m getting some lighter mandarin flavor without too much of a waxy base.  Tastes a little thin, although still on the sweeter side.  Feels a bit flat, without much in the way of tartness.\n\nAt 7%,  this is bigger, brighter, sweeter, and tarter.  Starting to get some of that artificial tang taste here underneath the brighter mandarin syrup.  Mouthfeel is good, but it gets a bit waxy and warm on me.\n\nVape Train suggests mixing with this at 2-3% and standalone at 5-7%.  Just based on these tests, that seems in the ballpark.  I’d probably use a heavier hand with it as an accent, around 4% and a primary flavor from 6-8% but that’s after a couple weeks of steeping.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Pretty competent straight up mandarin flavor.  This feels a bit soft to really take center stage in a mix, but should work well stuck up against other fruits as a mandarin accent that isn’t too zest heavy or harsh.  All the usual suspects, really. \n\nNothing here that suggests it wouldn’t work in a creamier application, so maybe do that.  Could also work for candies.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  Nothing much that I can find.\n\n[Here’s the product page from Vape Train.  Their description:  “a juicy sweet mandarin flavor that mimics the taste of a real mandarin, this flavour is a natural extract which will provide your e-liquid recipe that authentic mandarin ejuice taste.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Vape Train Mango Juice, 3% and 7%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 14 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Fairly mellow and thick mango flavor.\n\nThe mango here seems a bit flat to me, but that’s probably the profile for a mango juice.  More of a dull sweet mango than anything really bright and intense.  Feels fairly close to a generic yellow peach flavor with some mango accents.\n\nFairly un-piney as far as mangoes go, but it’s there.  The top notes have a light to moderate underripe mango greeness.  It’s not overwhelming at all, but it seems to be at least present especially in the higher sample.  I don’t think it’s green enough to be a “deal-breaker” but it’s a component of the flavor. \n\nThere’s something buttery in the base here that doesn’t quite fit with a fresher or nectar type of mango.  Seems maybe just a bit buttery, but not a rancid type of butyric. Feels like the heavy, rich part of an overripe mango without the funkier, muskier parts.  It sort of reminds me of some of CAP Sweet Mango without the heavier rotten note.\n\nMouthfeel overall is moderately full.  Feel fairly thick, but not really juicy.  Actually starts to feel a bit dry with extended vaping.   Sweetness level seems pretty on point for a mango nectar.  Sweetened, but not candied.\n\n**Off-Flavors:**  Duller mango, mouthfeel is a bit dry for a mango juice.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light.  Seems to get a bit dry but nothing super harsh or unexpected.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 3%, this is fairly thick but indistinct.  I’m getting more mouthfeel than actual mango.  Not a lot of pine, but i’m missing any brighter, vibrant mango.  A little bit of that richness.\n\nAt 7%, the mango is clearer but still not really bright.  Still dense, almost feels a bit buttery.  Light to moderate pine notes.  Seems to be getting a bit dry.\n\nVape Train suggests mixing this at 3-5% or standalone 5-10%.  That’s probably in the ballpark, but I don’t dig this as a standalone.  Just based on these tests, I’d probably go with 4-6% to thicken up another mango or peach.  \n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Out of the 3 vape train mangoes I’ve tried, this probably does taste the most like mango nectar.  Shisha Mango is brighter and sweeter, and green mango is definitely green.  With that said, I’d still probably grab FLV Mango for a mango nectar type flavor, and given the relative strengths the value proposition isn’t markedly different.\n\nThat richness here seems better suited for backing up another mango instead of using this as a primary mango flavor.  I’d use it to thicken up and reinforce a brighter mango like VT Shisha Mango without making the whole thing feel too overripe like CAP Sweet Mango.  It could probably pull the same trick with more realistic peach flavors, getting you to a fuller peach that doesn’t taste like candy.\n\nPairing this, should work well with the usual suspects for a mango.  Strawberry, Pineapple, Coconut, Guava, etc… \n\nI could also see working this into something like a mango cream.  I don’t think the relatively lighter pine notes are going to really show up against a richer cream flavor and then the thickness and almost buttery richness is probably going to be an asset.\n\nAlternatively, this could be a really interesting mango to pair with tobaccos if that isn’t completely over by now.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  Again, coming up empty handed on second opinions.\n\n[No description, but here’s the product page from Vape Train.](https://www.vapetrain.com.au/shop/vt-concentrates/cheesecake-flavour-concentrate-diy-for-e-liquid-recipe-making/)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Vape Train Mother Energy, 1%, 4% and 8%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 41 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Mother Energy is an actual energy drink in Australia and New Zealand that I’ve never had, so take all this requisite amount of grains of salt.  I am, however, an avid consumer of chemical energy slurry in general so I’ll be coming at it as a fan of the genre, if not this specific drink.\n\nFor the ‘muricans, this leans toward Monster. Apparently Mother is manufactured by Coke, so that makes some kind of sense.  It has some of that playdough vibe that seems familiar from the original green can of monster that I don’t really get from red bull.  Not too overwhelming as far that kind of flavor goes but doesn’t taste much like the brighter, cleaner red bull.\n\nThe original mother apparently used a good deal of acai palm juice, but I’m sort of struggling to pick up anything too distinct on the fruit side of the house.  I do maybe kind of light hint of some kind of dark berry at lower percentages, but it’s pretty fleeting overall.  Heavy citric acid kind of tartness without any clear specific citrus notes to it.  Just feels like whatever usual tart chemical byproduct they use in most energy drinks.  Slight herbal, bitter hit that could be standing in for the guarana and all that, but doesn’t feel any more herbal than most energy drinks.\n\nBasically a pretty straight forward sweet tarts dissolved in battery acid kind of vibe.  Fairly heavy sweetness, but it feels like a bit more a dry sweetness instead of a vaguely syrupy beverage HFCS beverage sweetness. Overall reads a bit dry and moderately harsh.\n\n**Off-Flavors:**  Can’t speak to authenticity for Mother in particular, but nothing that feels out of place for a energy drink profile in general.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Moderate to Harsh.  Pretty throaty in general.  Maybe a bit harsher than FW Green Goblin which is the closest analogue concentrate I’ve tried.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 1%, this feels fairly dry.  Clear “energy” taste to do it, but those playdough notes are at least sort of in control.  Soft berry fruitiness here.  Actually feels fairly well balanced here, but the texture is kind of thin and it doesn’t feel completely fleshed out.\n\nAt 4%,  more playdough.  Whatever berry I was getting is pretty much gone.  Feels much more generically tart up here.  Maybe a tiny bit of that acai cocoa hit up here, but it’s sort of hard to tell over the taste of that energy thing. Starting to get a bit sweeter, and fairly throaty but feels less dry and a bit more beveragey.\n\nAt 8%,  even heavier on the energy.  Pretty massively tart and sweet without much nuance. Comes across as fairly harsh.\n\nVape Train suggests mixing this at 1-5% or 5-9% standalone.  I’d be on the lower end of that.  I think I’d be using this an accent around 2% or a fuller, bolder flavor around 5%.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Well, it’s an energy drink flavor.  So you’ll mostly want to stick with fruits.\n\nSince this is already fairly harsh and can read as a bit try I’d stay with juicier, more mellow fruits.  Would work with some apple or pear to bulk it up a bit and take some of that really aggressive edge off.   I could see a more mellow guava or juicier mango flavor too.  If you wanted to play up that red berry thing, could work well with a heavier syrupy pomegranate like TPA Pom Deluxe.  Or maybe a pretty mellow raspberry like FW Razzleberry.\n\nOr add some black licorice and roll your own jager bomb.\n\nThe nuance here is pretty subtle compared to something like FW Green Goblin.  For the most part, if you’ve already got Green Goblin or another energy drink flavor you’re big into, I’m not sure this brings all that much new to the table.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  Still not much out there on the google.\n\nNo notes on the ELR page, but it did get used in a couple of recipes including [this.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/recipe/2270496/Vape%20with%20Wings)  It could work beautifully (?) but just looking at that recipe completely destroys my will to live.  Risky click of the day.\n\n[Here’s the product page from Vape Train.

They do however suggest SOLO:5-9% MIXED:1-5%\n\n**5%:** Fresh it had a light subtle oaky note with some char and smoke. Then week 1-3 the char and smoke had faded out. Just a very light wood note was all that was left. Didn't seem harsh or dry. Didn't seem thin either.\n\n**9%:** Has a whiskey/bourbon smell to it. Whiskey/bourbon is also coming through on the vape. Charred smokiness is more noticeable. Oak woodiness is more powerful as well. No harshness, seems moist, has a decent body and no terrible off flavors.\n\n**Pairings:** Would go great with tobaccos or whiskey/bourbon cocktails \n\n**Conclusion:** This flavor seems like it is meant to be used in the higher percentage range. If your wanting the whiskey char notes use closer to the 5% range in a mix. If you're only wanting a light wood note use in the 1-2% range in a mix. At 9% I really enjoyed this as a solo, also seems to need little to no steep time. ",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Vape Train Orange Juice, 3% and 7%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 21 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  A tart tropical fruit smoothie? More acidic than orange.\n\nThe citrus here is mostly represented by the tartness.  It has a bright, intense acidity to it.  I think that part fits with the orange juice profile. Anything over 2 weeks is usually enough to knock out any acidity that’s going to readily fade, and it’s definitely hanging in there.  The more I vape this, the more orange I’m finding behind that citrus.  It’s not prominent to really come across like an orange juice, but there are some sharper orange zest type accents stuck in there.\n\nThe body of the flavor doesn’t do orange for me.  Tastes somewhere between a green banana like FA Banana and an artificial, dry mango like TPA Phillipine Mango.  Overall effect is sort of like a fruit smoothie.  You have that orange tartness, but I’m missing an orange juice thickness or an overwhelming orange flavor.\n\nModerately full texture overall.  That tartness makes it a bit aggressive, but there is a bit of thickness underneath there.  Doesn’t have that strangely thick texture of an actual orange juice. Sweetness level overall seems about appropriate for something based on fruit.  Not too aggressively sweet or candied.\n\nAs far as orange juices go, this seems to lag behind a bit.  WF SC Orange Juice hits the acidity and the orange fairly well.  FA Royal Orange is warmer and waxier, and lacking the clear acidity, but it tastes quite a bit more like oranges than this does.\n\n**Off-Flavors:**  Banana and mango in the body.  Tropical fruit smoothie kind of vibe instead of straight orange juice.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Moderate, but that’s mostly from the tartness here.  Doesn’t feel out of line for an orange juice concentrate.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 3%,  I’m mostly getting tartness and a sort of indistinct fruit background.  The orange isn’t really present aside from the tartness.\n\nAt 7%,  pretty aggressively tart, and I do get a bit of discrete orange.  The sort of fruity background is getting a bit more definition to it, and I can pick out the green banana and underripe mango.  Moderately dense and sweet, but not crazy thick or candied.\n\nVape Train suggests mixing with this at 2-4%, standalone at 5-12%.  Just based on these tests, I’d be mixing with this primarily as an additive or modifier around 2-3%.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I’m not sure I’d be reaching for this as an orange juice per se, at least in a profile where I would need a clear orange.  While the tartness from orange juice is there, I’m not getting much orange flavor and this is dragging along a lot of other fruit baggage with it.\n\nThis already reminds me quite a bit of fruit smoothie, I’d use it like an orange smoothie type additive paired up against fruits.  There’s already some green banana in here, would probably work up against a more artificial banana like tpa banana cream to give a fairly full banana without being too overtly runty.  As for the mango, it could probably filled out with something like FLV Mango or your personal non gross mango of choice.  Outside of just reinforcing some of the stuff already in here, it would probably go well with pineapple, coconut, or even strawberry.  Or double down on citrus and throw a flavor like FA Blood Orange in there and let the tartness carry it. \n\nI wouldn’t even be opposed to working some cream into this.  Actually feels like you get close-ish to an  orange julius type vape with another bolder orange right down the middle.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  Not really anything, via the google.\n\n[Here’s the product page from Vape Train.

Not your regular ni80, quite good tbf but not worth full price) @.54ohms \n\n**Percentage**: 1\n\n**Steeped**: SNV first and thrown far away to not tempt me. 7 days for this review with a LOT of temptation to pop it open again and vape it all.\n\nI literally don't want to move my vape away from my mouth, this is way too tasty. I tried it shake and vape and vaped through 4ml like it was nothing I literally had to stop myself. 7 days later it's not changed much other than becoming fuller.\n\nMost of you might remember my obsession with Jessica Alba. Well this is like being with Jessica Alba again but while Gillian Anderson reads me stories. It's ideal. It's the 2 in 1 you've craved all your life. Feel free to replace Jessica and Gillian with your preferred people or hell even objects but make sure those two people or objects complement each other and enhance their strengths just right because this flavour is just that - two things that work together great.\n\nThe passionfruit is nice and wet. Proper juicy. And it's the first note you feel on your tongue as the mango's ripe flavour comes into play. It's fantastic. It's filling your mouth with flavour and then gifting you with a lovely mango aftertaste. \n\nI can't not recommend this to everyone into the more exotic fruits. I love to eat mango in massive amounts be it on its own, with chili powder or in a mango lassi. The passionfruit complements it so well. Just beautifully. It's not overpowering. They just mix together great and work really good. \n\n**Verdict**: If you're into Jessica Alba, get this. If you're into Chris Hemsworth, get this. If you're into beaches and great relaxing summer vibes, get this.

    "markdown": "*I've been SFTing a flavour per day for a few weeks now. So I thought I may as well start posting my notes.*\n\n**Flavour Name:** VT Paw Paw\n\n**SFT at** 2.5% and 4% (added 1.25% to what remained in the tester bottle) 60/40, 1mg\n\n**Tested on:** Hadaly, single alien KA1, 0.55 ohms, 35w\n\n**Steeped for:** 2.5% tester - 1 day (overnight). 4% tester - SNV (although the 2.5% tester I added to had steeped overnight) and overnight and 4 days.\n\n\n**Flavour Description:** I really like this flavour. I could vape it as a SF. It's really tasty and refreshing. Fairly complex. Slightly creamy base, in a similar way to how banana is creamy, but without any banana flavour. Honeydew melon and slight cucumber -ish notes which makes it really refreshing. Has a bit of tropical funkiness and tartness, similar to that of passion fruit, that runs all the way through the vape. Not particularly sweet, but does have some nice sweetness to it. I can't really speak to authenticity as I don't think I've had paw paw before. But its natural and not candied at all. Nice juiciness. It's very flavourful and distinctive.\n\n\n**Mouthfeel/ Texture:** slight creaminess. Nice juiciness.\n\n\n**Off Notes:** nothing tastes off or sticks out. But I can't say how accurate it is to the real thing.\n\n\n**Throat Hit:** none\n\n\n**% Testing:** at 2.5% it's not as full flavoured as I'd like for a SF or if I was using it as a main note in a mix. I've used it before in a mix at 3.75% and it was bolder and had a lovely tanginess that isn't quite coming through at 2.5%.\n\nAt 4% as a SNV it's still not bold enough. I remember it being a lot more present when I used it previously. After an overnight steep it's much better, much bolder and more saturated. After 4 days it hasn't changed. I'd say 4% is about right for a SF and maybe 3.5-4% as a main note in a mix, with an overnight steep.\n\n\n**Use and Pairings:** it's very flavourful and distinctive. So it's something I'd probably want to build a recipe around. I think you could just add a couple of other flavours and get a really nice, complex tasting mix.\n\n\nI could see it easily getting muddied if used with too many other tropical fruit flavours that have that similar funkiness. It shares a lot of similarities with honeydew melon and has the same refreshing quality. So could be a different alternative to using honeydew?\n\n\nIt already has that creamy base so would probably be pretty easy to work into some sort of creamy mix. I used it in a pineapple, paw paw yoghurt recipe and it worked really well.\n\nhttps://alltheflavors.com/recipes/184123#pineapple_and_paw_paw_yoghurt_mixinvixens_by_dixxleroo\n\n**It seems to have used the photo from my recipe on ATF.

    "markdown": "*Disclaimer: I didn't pay for this, shoutout to Vape Train for sending this to me.*\n\n**Setup:** Recoil w/ flavor barrel, Dual 12 wrap 24g 3.5mm SS316 @.31 ohms. 60w power, 450F temp limit. Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Vape Train Persian Lime, 1%, 4% and 8%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 16 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  A pretty well-rounded lime, mixing tartness, sweetness, and a bit of zest.\n\nThe lime here is all over the place, in mostly a good way.  Vape Train says this is their realistic lime, and it definitely hits some of those kind of notes.  I get a pretty realistic lime zest in the top notes.  Not overwhelming or too harsh, but manages to be fairly present, at least before a longer steep.  There is also a fairly realistic lime tartness to this.  I wouldn't really call it fresh lime juice acidic, but the tartness adds some contrast and feels fairly realistic for something like a limeade.  That tartness and zest plays off a sweeter, heavier base.  Unsteeped, it's a little less thick than FA Distilled Lime, but it also isn't nearly as harsh.  I think the base ends up sweet enough it kind of pulls this off a super realistic lime profile, but it's pretty well balanced.\n\nAnd what would a citrus be without at least a little bit of weirdness in steeping?  While this doesn't completely fade out like some other lime flavors, it does seem to change a bit.  Off a shake, this actually seems to have quite a bit of fairly realistic lime zest.  It's a bit thin, not terribly harsh, and reminds me a lot of a fuller version of FA Cold Pressed.  Understandably, some of those really heavy zest notes start to die down with a steep.  At about a week, I was still getting some zest but it was definitely a bit less aggressive.\n\nThis also seems to sweeten up considerably on a steep.  At a week the uptick in sweetness was noticeable.  At 16 days, it seems even sweeter and it's pushing a bit towards a candy or limeade type flavor.  It's not that obnoxious bright \"green\" kind of skittles lime taste like something like FLV Lime, but more of a sweeter, heavier lime hard candy.  Still has some pop and acidity like an actual lime, but it's gotten heavier and kind of sugary.  It's kind of reminding me of a lime version of what some of the lemon flavors do where they basically turn into a lemonhead with a steep.\n\nTrying to put this in some context, seems somewhere between the sweeter, brighter FA distilled lime and the more realistic FA Cold Press lime.  As it steeps, it also picks up some of the sweetness of something like FW Key Lime or TPA Key Lime.  It's the utility infielder of the lime world.\n\n**Off-Flavors:** Nothing un-limeish.  Seems to steep out considerably sweeter than it starts out, so that's a bit odd.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light.  Pretty mellow for a lime or citrus in general.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 1%, especially steeped, I'm not getting a ton out of this. Some light tartness, some heavier candy sweetness, but it doesn't really feel fleshed out or filled in at all.  I'm tasting a bit of my base through this.\n\nAt 4%,  this is starting to fill in.  That lime zest is coming through a bit more,there is still some tartness, and that sweeter base is definitely deeper and more solid.  Balance is fairly good here, and there isn't much harshness.\n\nAt 8%,  this doesn't really feel blown out.  The zest is a bit heavier but it isn't too harsh and the base is feeling pretty heavily candied. While I'm getting most of what I want out the flavor, there isn't really anything that makes me think this couldn't comfortably go a bit higher.\n\nVape Train suggests using this mixed 3-5% and standalone 6-9%.  That actually doesn't seem far off. It's one of the least intense lime flavors I've had, especially with a steep.  Just based on these tests, and if you're planning on anything with a steep, I'd probably be using around 3-4% as an accent, and maybe 8% as a primary note but that seems flexible.  As a S&V or short steep, I'd probably go at 4-5%.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Kind of a catch-all lime.  At lower percentages the zest and tartness are going to come through a bit easier than the sweeter parts of this.  Should work well as a lime accent in stuff like fruit mixes or sweeter beverages.  I think it's probably a bit too sweet for really heavy cocktail applications.\n\nShould mix pretty well with heavier creams and custards in general, adding some decent lime flavor without coming across as too tart, bitter, or harsh.\n\nShould also work in bakeries or cheesecakes, especially at higher percentages where that sweetness really comes out.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  [Noted had a big old lime fiesta recently and VT Persian Lime was covered.  Starting at 54:50 the mighty ID10-T and some other jerk talk about this flavor.  Selected quotes: \"I dig this one.\" \"Better alternative to (FA) Distilled.\" \"lime zest up top, sort of that syrupy type base, less fizzy but a whole lot more limey than Distilled.\" \"not harsh at all.\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxvUpbfW-BA)\n\n[Here is the product page from Vape Train.  Their description:  \"Persian Lime has a real lime taste that’s sour just like a real lime, this flavour can be used and paired with other fruits such as Apricot, Banana, , Fig, Grapefruit, Guava, Lemon, Lychee, Orange, Mango, Papaya, Passion Fruit, Persimmon, Pineapple, Raspberry and Strawberry. Persian lime is also suitable for your alcohol beverage e-liquid recipes which may include Brandy, Cognac, Gin, Rum, Tequila & Vodka.\"  That is a whole lot of things.  After a steep I'd quibble a bit about how realistic this comes across, but yeah... throw it in whatever.](https://www.vapetrain.com.au/shop/vt-concentrates/persian-lime-flavour-concentrate-diy-for-e-liquid-recipe-making/)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

First toke left me disappointed because after yesterday's Coconut I expected to instantly teleport to the beach with Jessica Alba next to me and the second toke to fast forward to the loving part. \n\nObviously that didn't happen, but what happened was a very enjoyable and blissful half an hour spent laying on my bed vaping this in pure pleasure. Hooooly fuck it feels like I'm sipping on some high quality proper squeezed pineapple juice. It has the tartiness, the mouthfeel (VTA somehow so far has nailed the mouthfeel on every juice of theirs I try, amazing!), the sharp high notes, the middle sweetness, the front of tongue acid feel. Hell it almost replicated the bromelin bite. I even taste tested it after eating teaspoons of my fave super spicy sauces and damn it just felt so fucking good after each one (I love pineapple post spicy sauce/food, it's like PHHHHHHHH so good). \n\nI am absolutely amazed at how well rounded and juicy it feels. It does give me the illusion that I'm actually sipping freshly made pineapple juice. I kind of only wish it was a bit more acidic, cause that's how I enjoy my pineapples, but damn this is perfect. Doesn't feel super sweet (looking at you Golden Pineapple), doesn't feel too gummy and bad textured (looking at you Golden Pineapple), just feels right. \n\nI'm a huge fan of pineapple IRL. My friends always call bullshit when they see my chopped pineapple bits cause they think they're storebought but truth be told I've chopped incredible amounts of pineapples. They used to be my salvation in my days of super heavy drinking and some other substances. Protip: They're the real hangover cure, you just need to force yourself to chop it. So for me finding a good pineapple was really difficult. For ages I stuck to INW's Pineapple for just enjoying some pineapple with coconut for example, or I'd make my more juicy recipes with my arch nemesis, CAP Golden Pineapple. But I always craved something more, something better, and this fits exactly what I crave in such a beautiful manner! Shame that I already made my DTL juice with the last bits of my Golden Pineapple instead of throwing it out and making it with this baby. \n\nI'm once again absolutely impressed by VTA. I promise I am not paid by them or anyone to praise what they're doing, I'm just genuinely really REALLY happy to have these juices with me. \n\n@VTA come on guys PLEASE make me some good authentic pineapple on its own and I can get rid of INW's Pineapple too! (Tho I do love INW Pineapple.)\n\nP.S: I feel there's a lot of experimentation ground with higher and lower % with this juice, so in the future might be returning to this review to add some extra info\n\nP.P.S: Handed this to my non-vaping/smoking housemate (I vape my testers without nic) and they too just lit up and enjoyed it a ton.

Mixed 70/30 1.5mg NIC. Tested at 2,3.5,&5%.\n\n\n**At 2%:** Felt full flavored, and the flavor was there freshly mixed. On the back of hand it tasted like a candied sour blackcurrant. When vaped sweetness was up front. Tartness was in the back. Blackcurrant tasted candy like. Didn’t notice any harshness or off notes.\n\n**At 3.5%** Noticeably sweeter and had more tartness. Also had a little a bit of harshness, and the blackcurrant felt more syrupy.\n\n**At 5%** The harshness was no worse than it was at 3.5%. Flavor wise it was sweeter, more sour, and had a more syrup like blackcurrant. Still no off notes\n\n\n**Pairings:** Fruits such as strawberries,tobaccos,desserts,or creams\n\n\n**Conclusion:** Vape Train describes it like so. “a smooth rounded flavour that would suit most e-juice recipe requirements. It’s subtle sweet and not overpowering like it’s counterparts in the marketplace. Easy to work with on a variety of mixes from tobaccos, fruit blends and even creams bakeries and desserts will benefit from this unique flavouring.” They also recommend using it at 2-5%. \n\nThey don't mention the tartness in the description but i definitely detect it. They also say it doesn’t over power the other ingredients, but i used it @2% in one of my tobacco recipes and it completely overpowered my tobaccos. I remixed and dropped it down to 1.5% bumped up my other ingredients, and it worked.\n\nFor solo testing i would start at 2% and work my way up. For mixing depending on what you are after anywhere from .25-2% should work.\n",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Vape Train Shisha Mango, 1%, 4% and 8%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 48 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  A mostly ripe mango, that’s just a touch dry and flat.\n\nThe mango here seems fairly ripe, depending on the percentage.  Seems just a bit squirrelly to dial in, but when it clicks you have a ripe mango body with some light greener accents. Some sweeter, candied mango notes, but the base of the flavor seems like a ripe mango, albeit just a little less juicy or pulpy.  Missing some of that realistic tartness, but definitely in the ballpark.\n\n Realistic green mango note though, lightly piney and tastes pretty authentic to the harder parts of a mostly ripe mango right next to the peel instead of just eating chunks of peel.  The amount of that green flavor seems to bounce around a bit based on percentage.  It’s a bit too green at 1%, complements the flavor nicely at 4%, and sort of dominates for me at 8%.  Used at that middle percentage, I’d say it’s definitely less offensive than some of the also-ran mangoes like FW, FA, or TPA.  Seems to have less peel than CAP Sweet Mango, but I’ve been informed that I’m unduly harsh on CAP Sweet Mango so YMMV.  I’d say it has more peel than FLV Mango, but not by a ton.\n\nAs much as this tastes like a ripe mango, it doesn’t quite feel ripe in terms of texture.  While it isn’t dry, it doesn’t have the crazy, pulpy juiciness of a ripe mango.  It also doesn’t quite feel heavy and syrupy like a mango nectar.  Solid texture though, and fills out nicely.  In terms of sweetness, feels accurately sweet to a ripe mango but it doesn’t really have the kind of tartness to contrast off that sweetness so it feels maybe just a bit candied.\n\nBut where does this fit in the vast constellation of mango concentrates you ask?  Well, on the “pleasant” end, definitely.  Its on the realistic end of the scale.  Tastes a bit candied, but it’s probably more realistic to me than anything but CAP Sweet Mango or FLV Mango.  It may end up being more useful than either of those though.  While this mostly ends up tasting ripe, it isn’t overripe like CAP Sweet Mango.  It doesn’t have that same sort of rotten note to it that CAP picks up higher percentages.  It may not hit quite as hard as CAP does, but it seems like it may be more workable in a wider variety of applications.  I think FLV Mango is fairly realistic, but it’s deep and pulpy and not particularly bright or vibrant to me.  I feel like this is just a bit brighter, although it does have that light hint of pine that I don’t get from FLV.\n\n**Off-Flavors:**  Not really? Some candied, flatter mango as opposed to tart and juicy, but overall it’s a ripe mango.  That greener note can get a bit overbearing at higher percentages.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  At 4% and under not really.  Seems to have a pretty drastic uptick in harshness between 4 and 8% though.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 1%,  this feels a bit flat.  The greener part of the mango is relatively strong but the juicier, fleshier parts haven’t really filled in.  Feels a bit dry and frontloaded without too much of a ripe mango base.\n\nAt 4%, this seems to be working pretty well.  Mostly just a ripe mango. Light peel notes, slightly juicy texture.  Not as pulpy or deep as FLV, but seems to be pretty close to a ripe mango without tasting overripe.\n\nAt 8%,  I’m getting quite a bit of the greener peel note and this feels a bit harsh.  That juiciness has kind of dryed up and feels a bit too solid without really being fleshy.  Significantly less charming here.\n\nVape Train suggests mixing with this at 2-5%.  That seems about right.  Just based on these tests, I’d probably go between 3-5% as a more primary type of note.  Doesn’t seem to scale linearly at lower percentages well enough to really suggest using this as an accent flavor, but I’ve never complained about having too much ripe mango in a juice so, again,  YMMV.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  All in all, not a bad choice for a single flavor mango, especially if you’re pairing up against other fruits that can lend a bit of juiciness and tartness.  Seems like a really obvious fit with a pineapple.  I’d probably go with CAP Golden Pineapple, but it seems a bit juicier to me than INW Pineapple.  I’m sure INW pineapple with this wouldn’t taste bad or anything.  If you wanted to layer in another mango, this goes really well with a bit of FLV Mango.\n\nBut yeah, it’s a mango.  Go nuts.  We’ve beat this horse half to death, but mango pretty much goes everywhere and with everything when done right.  Mango creams, mango fruit mixes, mango bakeries, mango tobaccos, all mango everything.  You can figure out a way to use a competent mango.  I trust you.    I will say, that green note ends up showing up in some weird places, so maybe watch out for anything that will end up popping the peel notes here.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  Still pretty light via the google.\n\n[There is an ELR Page up for this.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Vape Train Shisha Melon, 3% and 7%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 21 days.\n**Flavor Description:**  Candied cantaloupe and creamy vanilla.\n\nThe melon here seems to be the closet to cantaloupe.  I realize it’s not the most scientific thing, but the product picture does show cantaloupes and it seems to mostly check out.  The cantaloupe feels a little bit more artificial that authentic.  Feels like it has some more candied notes that lean close to the canary melon in INW Melon.  Lightly juicy melon, but I’m getting a bit of bitterness to this.  It seems maybe just a touch floral, and also lightly fermented? Like a chunk of cantaloupe that’s been left out on a buffet table for a bit too long.\n\nSome heavier, richer notes here that sort of fit with a cantaloupe, but there also seems to be some kind of vanilla in here.  Feels like a soft-serve ethyl vanillin type flavor, and the creamier parts of this have a fluffier texture.  Overall effect is kind of like cantaloupe on whipped cream.  Not unpleasant at all, but the vanilla is fairly prominent.\n\nMouthfeel overall is full, with that fluffier vanilla cream base and the slight juiciness from the cantaloupe. Top end feels just a bit dry, but overall is a reasonably full solo vape.  Sweetness pulls toward candy for the cantaloupe, but that creamier base feels like a pretty restrained whipped cream level of sweetness.  \n\n**Off-Flavors:**  Creamy vanilla base.  Light floral notes and a bit of a vaguely fermented funk.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light.  Base is very smooth but seems just a bit throaty on the top end.\n \n**Percentage testing:**  At 3%,  this feels like a relatively smooth blend of vanilla cream and cantaloupe.  Feels fairly soft, without any real separation.  Melon is a touch weak, but doesn’t have too many of those more aggressive candy notes. Sweet and sort of just pleasant without being too full of a flavor.\n\nAt 7%,  i’m getting a clearer separation between the melon and the cream base.  Feels more like melon on top of vanilla cream.  Fluffy texture to the cream, slight juiciness to the melon with a heavier candied melon taste.  Starting to get those off notes though.\n\nThe only percentage guideline from Vape Train on this is 5-10%.  Just based on these tests,  I’d probably be on the lower end of that.  I’d use this as an accent around 2% and a primary note from 5-6%. \n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  You could easily play up the creamy vanilla in the base here and add some more whipped cream.  In general, canteloupe takes buttery notes better than other melons, so something like CAP Vanilla Whipped Cream wouldn’t be out of the question.  You could also thicken this up substantially with something like INW Shisha Vanilla.\n\nHard to mix around that vanilla note, so any fruits you pair with this are going to pick up a bit of an ambrosia or fruit salad vibe.  With that said, should pair well with oranges, strawberries, peaches, pineapples or apricots.  You could double down on the melon salad thing with some honeydew or watermelon.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  Nada via the Google.\n\n[Here’s the product page from Vape Train.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Vape Train Shisha Raspberry, 1%, 4% and 8%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 12 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Vape Train says this: \"is on the slightly on the sweeter spectrum of raspberry flavours without the tartness of actual real raspberries.\"  I'm not sure I agree.\n\nThe top end of the flavor is actually fairly tart.  Feels like a pretty realistic kind of raspberry tartness, stopping short of an over-aggressive citrusy or sour candy type of tartness. Softer flavor, without much in the way of bite or punch. Base is a bit heavier, but still not overwhelmingly sticky or cloying.  I think the base is where the candy is coming in, with a warm, flat kind of sweetness.  Pretty straight-forward raspberry candy flavor, but not really intense.  Overall effect with the tartness is still sort of candied, but not a full on candy raspberry.\n\nI will say, I think this flavor lacks some vibrancy and depth.  That tarter top end is relatively thin and soft, and the body doesn't hit a syrupy, bold kind of richness you get from the more aggressive raspberry flavors.  The actual structure of the flavor kind of reminds me of a Medicine Flower flavor.  What's here is fairly evocative of a raspberry, it just doesn't cohere into something that feels bold, at least at the tested percentages.\n\nOff-flavors feel pretty mellow for a raspberry flavor.  At 8% I'm picking up something a maybe a bit floral, but it's not nearly as floral as berry flavors can get.  I'm not picking up anything green or vegetal.  It also doesn't seem to have the dreaded ketchup vibe of TPA Sweet Raspberry.\n\nI think the closest analogue for this I've tested is probably FLV Red Raspberry.  I think the FLV Red Raspberry tastes a bit more realistic and almost seedy, but this is quite a bit more easygoing and imparts some of that tartness without having to really fine-tune your percentages to avoid blowing the recipe out with aggressive florals and sticky sweetness.\n\n**Off-Flavors:**  Lightly floral at higher percentages.  Feels a bit soft.\n\n**Throat Hit:**Light, I get a tiny bit of bite but not out of line for a fruit flavor. \n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 1%,  I'm getting some light, fairly realistic raspberry tartness in the top notes.  Sweeter base hasn't really come through, and I'm still tasting quite a bit of my testing base.\n\nAt 4%,  tartness is a bit more pronounced. Still feels fairly realistic.  Lightly candied raspberry base, stil feels a bit soft and not really heavy or syrupy.\n\nAt 8%, doesn't feel much more tart or busy on the top end.  Picking up a light floral note. Base is maybe just a bit heavier but still doesn't feel all that full. \n\nVape Train suggests mixing this from 2-5%, and that seems like a good enough recommendation.  Just based on these tests, I'd say this is vapable higher, but doesn't really bring anything to the table at higher concentrations. I'd go around 2-3% as a raspberry accent.  Doesn't really seem to have enough presence for a solo or primary flavor.  As soft as the top end of this flavor feels, it does show up pretty well in mixes from some limited mixing experience with it.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I'd use this as a tarter raspberry accent in heavier profiles. Seems like a really good fit for tobaccos, or as raspberries (instead of a raspberry frosting or jam) on top of a bakery profile.  Really good fit for cocktail or beverage profiles.  Kind of reminds me of the raspberry note from raspberry zinger tea.\n\nDecent raspberry choice for creams to keep them from going too floral or turning them into something that feels like a raspberry syrup.\n\nYou could probably throw enough at this to make it sort of work as a candy raspberry, but there are better options for that.\n\nWould work okay as a raspberry accent in busier fruit profiles, assuming you've got most of your body from something else.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  I can't find anything solid out there.\n\n[Here's the product page from Vape Train Australia.

After it steeped for 2 weeks I tried it again. It was still very candy like, but kind of has the mouthfeel of a jam or jelly. It really reminds me of the Brach's Strawberry Bon Bons candy with the chewy center. It really seems to coat the tongue the flavor sticks around for a while after you vape it. At times I felt like I was getting some ws-23 like coolness on the tail end of the exhale, but it was present through the testing. This is worth picking up if you are into strawberry candy vapes.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Vape Train Sugarloaf Pineapple, 3% and 7%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 14 days.\n**Flavor Description:**  Bright, tart pineapple with some candy sweetness.\n\nPretty straight ahead pineapple flavor.  Manages to capture the acidity of a fresh pineapple without being tropical battery acid like TPA Pineapple.  Fairly tart, but not overwhelmingly harsh or acidic.\nBrighter than something like pineapple juice, at least at higher percentages.  I do get a sort of flatter, sweeter candy base here, but the tartness really carries it and keeps this from tasting too much like white gummy bears.\n\nSome juicier texture here in the base, although not quite ripe pineapple juicy. Juicier than any pineapple concentrate I’ve tried with maybe the exception of CAP Golden Pineapple.   Moderately full texture but not really fleshy.  More of a dense, syrupy fullness and the higher sweetness level sells that in a bit harder. \n\nThis tastes quite a bit like a brighter, more saturated version of INW Pineapple to me.  At similar percentages, this feels sweeter and fuller than INW Pineapple, while still keeping a good balance between tartness and candy sweetness.\n\n**Off-Flavors:**  Not really.  Has just the tiniest hint of a sulfur note present in pretty much all pineapple concentrates I’ve tried.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Moderate to harsh, but it’s really not bad for a bright, tart flavor.  Maybe a bit harsher than INW Pineapple or CAP Golden Pineapple but nearly as harsh as TPA Pineapple.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 3%, this feels a bit flat.  I’m getting a slightly duller pineapple flavor with less tartness and acidity.  Feels a bit like a sort of mid-grade pineapple candy flavor or a pineapple juice.  Fuller than 5% INW Pineapple though.\n\nAt 7%,  this is a lot bigger and brighter.  Tart pineapple top notes on top of that candy sweet base.  Also feels a bit juicier.  Getting maybe a bit harsh, but pretty solid overall.\n\nVape Train suggests mixing with this at 2-5% and standalone from 5-9%.   That doesn’t seem that far off.   Just based on these tests, I’d start as an accent around 3% and use this closer to 6-8% as a primary flavor.  Just for laughs I mixed this up at 10% and it’s maybe a bit too acidic so I’d watch the high end on this.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This seems like a pretty good fit most of the places that you’d use pineapple.  Should work well in most fruit profiles, adding a good hit of sweetness and tartness to anything you throw at it.  Good, bright tropical flavor to accent mango, banana, coconut, or papaya.  Might get a bit harsh next to citrus though.   Should also work well in most fruit based beverage profiles.\n\nNothing here that wouldn’t work with creams, but it may come across a bit artificial.  Seems too bright for a more realistic cooked pineapple or canned pineapple usually used there.  In a similar vein, probably wouldn’t be my first choice for bakeries or other darker, layered profiles. \n\n**Second Opinions:**  Not a lot out there via the google.\n\n[Here is the product page from Vape Train.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Vape Train Sweet Raspberry, 3% and 7%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 14 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Very candied “red” fruit flavor.\n\nThis tastes a whole lot like swedish fish.  Probably more generically red than anything I’d identify as a raspberry.  Same kind of red currant or lingonberry candy thing going on without much in the way of realism or freshness.    Feels more generically red than the sweeter raspberry concentrates like FW Razzleberry or TPA Sweet Raspberry.  Some really light tartness, but overall seems warm and flat.  Nothing floral, but the top notes seem pretty dead.  Also not getting much in the way of juiciness or fleshiness here.\n\nI’m picking up something just a bit muddy and savory on the back of the flavor.  Almost like a light ketchupy off note. Probably less present than in TPA Sweet Raspberry, but feels like the same kind of off-note.  Sweeter flavor overall, which fits in with that whole swedish fish thing. Mouthfeel is just a bit sticky, but overall the flavor seems a bit thin.  The actual body of this flavor, at least at the tested percentages, doesn’t really seem to fill in for me.\n\n**Off-Flavors:**  Tastes more “red” than raspberry.  Light ketchup off-flavor.  Vapes a bit thin for the level of sweetness here.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Not really.  Not picking up any really harsh here.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 3%,  This feel really light to me.  I’m getting a clear swedish fish type flavor, but not much body or saturation.  Lightly sticky, but feels thin.\n\nAt 7%,  a bit fuller but still feels kind of hollow.  Clear “red” flavor, nothing that feels like a realistic or even clear candy raspberry.  Sticky, sweet, but thin.\n\nVape train suggests using this from 4-6% in a mix and 6-12% standalone.  That’s a bit higher than usual VT Range so I mixed up a tester at 12%.  Granted, I’ve only got about 3 days on that one, but the higher percentages don’t really seem to fill this out.  I’d still say it’s sticky, a bit airy, sweet, and “red.”  Just based on these tests, I’d be mixing with this around 8-10% as a primary note, although it would proably need something else going on to fill it in a bit.  Would work fine as a hint of swedish fish at 3-4%. \n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I can’t really get around the swedish fish thing.  Would probably pair up well against CAP 27 Fish to fill that out a bit and coast on the more candied mouthfeel there.\n\nMixed up against fruits, it isn’t really going to taste bad, just not much like a raspberry.  Could fill out a candy profiles where you already have your texture nailed down.  Could add some oomph to red licorice profiles, or maybe sweetening up a blue raspberry base.\n\nTastes a bit sweet and generic to really use a realistic fruit in cream, custard, or bakery mixes. \n\n**Second Opinions:**  I’m not finding anything via Google. \n\n[Here’s the product page from Vape Train.

    "markdown": "**Vape Train White Chocolate Base**\n\n**DISCLAIMER: These are my personal notes that I am sharing with the community & all palates are different.**\n\n**Setup:** Hussar RDA V1 Parallel N80 26G 6.5 wraps 2.5MM .3 ohm 35 watts\n\n**Mixing Info:** Steeped for 24 days Tested fresh & weekly Mixed 6% & 9%\n\n**VTA Description:** \"a white chocolate recipe Kickstarter, designed to create a foundation for to suit most e-liquid recipes that require the use of chocolate. This flavour can be utilised in an array of styles from creamy milk chocolate, to a dessert and bakery styled eliquid recipe. Pairing is made simple with fruits and or other creamy bases.\" Their suggested usage range is SOLO:5-9%. MIXED:2-5%  They also say 3-6 day steep.\n\n**6%:** It smells amazingly accurate to a white chocolate and the knuckle test is very similar to a white chocolate. Freshly mixed wasn't much flavor at all. After a week some white chocolate and cream coming through. At 2 weeks it seems fully steep full flavor white chocolate like note, some creaminess, and a sour like cream cheese note. No strange off notes other than the cream cheese. It is slightly dry but not harsh. Has a decent bodied mouthfeel.\n\n**9%:** White chocolate is amplified, also getting a milk chocolate like note, sour cream cheesy note is more noticeable. No harshness, but it is still a bit dry, and still has medium bodied mouthfeel.\n\n**Pairings:** Fruits, creams & bakeries. Just make sure not to use with anything that is dry or harsh because it will make the VT White Chocolate even drier which will be very unpleasant. \n\n**Conclusion:** VTA's suggested usage seems about right. Off notes would be @9%. I got a bit of a milk chocolate as well as the white chocolate. The cream cheese would also be an off flavor being that it is not a note people would get from eating white chocolate.  It was slightly dry and has the cream cheese note you may have to cover up if it is not wanted. Also think that adding some vanilla and some more creams. You make a good vanilla white chocolate mousse style recipe.\n",

    "markdown": "Steeped SnV, 1 day, 3 day, 4 day tested on a Zenith 0.8 Kanthal coil @ 3% etc\n\nHonestly I ain't no master of peaches, I don't like eating peaches IRL, I find it too messy. British peaches are funny tho, they don't behave like peaches nor have any similar taste. Just a side/funny note, don't kill me brits pls I still gotta live in this country.\n\nRight onto the flavour. It's really nice and really hits the tongue well and the roof of the mouth. It just feels very focused on both parts no matter how I vaped em. I recently stopped DTL (well I only DTL like 1-2 times per week) so I can't speak about that, but MTL that's what I felt. Pretty interesting mouthfeel overall. Very smooth to inhale. \n\nExhale was quite pleasant as well.\n\nThe flavour is really confusing me tho. I've heard of flavourings which change based on temperature, but always figured it's just a weird niche. Well here we have one definitely so I guess I'll write my settings and what I experienced?\n\n1 of 4 holes open, 15w: Nice pleasant aroma of peaches, smells delicious (the bottle itself just smells absolutely fantastic). Makes me feel like it's the perfect accent like this. I really enjoy exhaling this through my nose for this reason, it just feels and smells delicious, even if the body is missing and the taste is mostly on the exhale. Enjoyable, mid notes are fantastic. \n\n1 of 4 holes, 16w: Short tokes - nada, long tokes - nada, just a slight tickle on my tongue maybe. Exhale has no taste, inhale has no taste, what the fuck is going on. \n\n2 of 4 holes, 16.5w: Suddenly it has taste again and DAMN it's good! It's actually REALLY really good! Currently I vary between this setting and the first one I mentioned because I really enjoy the sensation of both of them! Really REALLY delicious, juicy feeling with a sharp bright peach note, really hits the spot. If this was the permanent flavour I'd be recommending this flavour A LOT! \n\n2 of 4 holes open, 18w: Nope, flavour's gone again, just a tiny bit of exhale. Feels like I'm vaping well textured VG/PG I guess? Really weird behavior.\n\nAll holes, 15w: very faint peach, quite lackluster, I don't dig it\n\nAll holes, 16w: Nothing, no flavour. Wtf. Have to toke a bunch of times to get some flavour going.\n\nAll holes, 17w: Loses a lot of the really enjoyable mouthfeel, but obtains the faint taste of generic underripe peach. Odd shit\n\nAll holes, 18w: Delicious albeit slightly underripe peach. Slightly \"green\" feel to it. \n\nThese are the settings I personally tried and I kid you not it DOES change a LOT between each of these. I really am baffled that this is happens with flavours, but then again chemistry is unpredictable (well no, it's predictable most often I guess). Now since I'm using Kanthal coils there's no point in trying to go for temperature control settings, but if anyone ever feels like giving it a shot do mention in the comment and I'll include it in the review. \n\nDo I recommend it? If you like nice legit peach sure, but use it as a single flavour, because I feel this flavour is very unpredictable. Unless you want to experiment even further and try different combos/use it in an ADV that changes itself a lot based on temperature (I can go into further detail, but without TC I can't really say much about the accuracy of end results). If you feel experimental and have time on your hands go right ahead! \n\nWhat would I pair it with? Pft, beats me, maybe something fleshy and tart to match its nice sweet sour aromatic feel. Strawberries maybe, I really don't know. Not huge on peaches IRL so beats me what people mix them with...\n\nWhat WOULDN'T I pair it with? I'd defo not keep it anywhere close to cookies/bakeries/pastries et cetera. \n\nThis also doesn't seem to change at all with steeping like NOTHING changed at all. Maybe I just was confused or something by it. Maybe it'll change in a recipe with something completely different? \n\nI know these are a bunch of maybes rather than informative statements, but this flavour is quite complex and definitely just an enigma for me. Very enjoyable, nonetheless.",

    "markdown": "Heyo guys! This is my first flavour review, and I actually think first actual post to the sub besides commenting. I decided to grab this flavour because it caught my eye and I saw that there wasn't really notes on it. I hope this helps some people in gauging if they want to pick up this flavour or not :)\n\n**Hardware:** Fused Claptons 26Gx2/36G SS, 6 wraps @ 3.5mm. Voopoo Drag & Asmodus C4 @ 60W\n\n**Mixing:** I mixed this concentrate at 40/60  VG PG, and at 2.5, 3.5, and 5%. I let all of these steep at least a week too, but nothing super amazing changed overtime. I’d even wager that the blueberry taste slightly faded over this time.\n\n**Flavor profile:** 2.5% - At this percent, on inhale I was hit with a very sweet gummy flavour that filled up my mouth. The mouth feel was pretty damn good too, but could use some help. On exhale, I got a very slight candied blueberry - nothing profound though, leaving me wanting more on the blueberry part.\n\n3.5% - I think this is where the flavour could shine as a main ingredient. The sweet gummy inhale was still there, but along with it came a sweet blueberry that carried out on exhale. I immediately think of the gummy sharks with the white underbellies and blue top at this %. The mouthfeel is a tad bit better too, and doesn’t get too gummy / weird. I do think the blueberry is still a bit unpronounced though, could probably do with a .5% increase\n\n5% - Definitely a sweet spot for this concentrate. I could taste the blueberry much better. Nothing else really changed.\n\n**Throat hit:** Minimal, if none.\n\n**Uses:** 2-3% - this could be used to boost gummy candy profiles nicely, especially ones surrounding any sort of “blue”.4-5% - Could be the main profile of a blueberry gummy candy. Throw in something to boost up the gummy a bit and I could imagine it working very well. It also could probably work in something like a sweeter take on a blueberry shake / smoothie too honestly.\n\n**Pairings:** Anything gummy like CAP Jelly Candy, and a candied blueberry like HS Blueberry are amazing pairings with this.\n\n**Off-flavors:** I don’t get any off-notes, but I don’t think I’d push it past 5% either. This definitely isn’t a good hard candy option for a recipe.\n\n**Second opinions:** I’ve found none as of right now actually!\n\n**Notes:** I went ahead and made a recipe to showcase this concentrate - as there seems to be only one as of now using it publically. Check it out here :) [https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/180432](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/180432)  \n\n\nMake sure to check out the [Flavour Review Wiki](https://link.diyejuice.org/reviews) for more flavour reviews!",

Syrupy and heavy like a pecan pie. No pie crust that I am detecting. \n\n**Off-flavors:**  None\n\n**Throat Hit:** A little stingy on the tail end of the exhale but goes away after a few puffs.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This would be good in creating a butter pecan ice cream or pralines and cream custard or something like where you want a sweeter nut type note in bakeries. I have a recipe I am working on where this might be a good replacement for fw butter pecan to add some additional sweetness. \n\n**Notes:** This is a very good standalone flavor at 5%. It has plenty of richness to compliment the nutty flavor. This is another flavor that is very sweet from Wonder Flavors so be aware that it will gunk your coils. These flavors are so sweet it makes me wonder if they are using fructose. \n\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Very rich, lots of butter, silky butterscotch and cream. I don't taste any pie crust but rather I get all delicious filling. This is a very sweet and decadent flavor. \n\n**Off-flavors:**  None to speak of. \n\n**Throat Hit:** None here, super smooth flavor\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I can see this flavor being used at low percentages to add some complexities and creaminess to caramels or at higher percentages to be the main butterscotch note in a custard or bakery. Basically, anywhere you want a butterscotch flavor this would work very well, except maybe if you were going after a hard crack/candy like butterscotch. \n\n**Notes:** I am noticing a pattern with WF that I personally like, and that is that their flavors are very sweet. I am not sure if these are supposed to be one shot type of concentrates or not but so far everything I have tried has been very good but very sweet. Some people may not want to add a lot of sweetness in their mix. If you are going for a tobacco or dryer type of bakery these flavors may not be the ones you want to reach for first. \n\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

Vaped it doesn’t have much flavor at all. \n\n\nWeek 1:\nGetting a strange borderline rotten fruit note and some oiliness. \n\n\nWeek 2: \nFruit and oil are both still there and are over taking any dough like notes. Also the spices WF mentions in the description are coming through. \n\n\nWeek 3&4:\nBoth off notes are still there and seem to have gotten stronger. Taste like someone had some raspberries that were about to rotten. Breaded them and put some all spice or nutmeg on them. Then deep fried them. Threw the raspberries away then decided to vape the left over oil.

    "markdown": "**Setup:** OG Recoil w/ flavor barrel, n80 Dual fused claptons @.30 ohms. 55 watts. Full Cotton Wicks.  Others as noted.\n\n**Testing:** Wonder Flavours Double Mint SC @ basically everything, various bases, Steeping isn't really an issue with this.\n\n**Profile:**  Peppermint and spearmint, heavier on the peppermint and with a good deal of mentholation.  Light but noticeable body to the mint, which knocks some of the sharpness off the menthol.  Light sweetness, but without the chalky body or vanilla notes of other mint gum type flavors.  Still for fans of menthol, but pretty satisfying as a solo flavor.\n\n**Off-Flavors:**  It's still a pretty aggressive mentholation.  Seems like a nice, clean menthol but it's going to be for the toothpaste boiz out there. \n\n**Throat Hit:**  Menthol heavy, so yes.  Nothing untoward for a menthol.  The bite is part of the point.\n\n**Percentage Recommendation:**  Follow your bliss, basically.  Fairly potent flavor.  It's always to going to lean into that menthol, so it's a bit of a tricky component to balance in a recipe.  Clearly identifiable at .5% in a mix as a menthol, and it gets overwhelming to a mix quickly.  If you want just a mint flourish in a recipe, you probably want to look somewhere else. It's also heavier on the peppermint than the spearmint, so fruit pairings aren't exactly a lay-up.\n\nMore successful as a solo flavor for people who actually like menthol.  I've sub-ohmed this at 3% in a 3mg juice and it's pretty rowdy.  I'm currently in a tighter MTL setup at 5% in a 12mg salt juice and it's still rowdy but doable.  I've gone up to 8% in a 25mg pod and it's solid.  I probably like it the most in a pod out of those options, but I've enjoyed all three. BUT AGAIN, I LIKE MY MENTHOL.\n\n**Other Resources:**\n\n[The Product Page](https://www.wonderflavours.com/collections/super-concentrated-flavours/products/double-mint-sc)\n\n[“All The Flavors” Page](https://alltheflavors.com/flavors/wonder-flavours-double-mint-sc)\n\n[“e-Liquid Recipes” Page](https://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/183962)\n\n*At one point Wonder Flavours sent me some of this.  I'm now on my second 120ml I've ordered.*\n\n___\n\n\n**Apexified:**  Hey.  You said you'd review a flavor a month.  You did one and then nothing for 3 months.  What in the actual fuck is wrong with you?\n\n*(Me ignoring his discord message for like 2 weeks.)*\n\n**Me:** Oh shit, yeah.  I was going to do that.  Uhhhh.... I've just been vaping Wonder Flavours Double Mint.  Maybe I'll write about that.\n\n**Apexified:**  I mean, it's a mint flavor.  Who care?\n\n**Me:**  I used to tell people that when I wasn't developing something I'd just vape menthol... and that has pretty much held true.  I don't really develop much anymore and this is a definitely a step up from just vaping menthol.  You'd think that a mint is a mint is a mint, but there is a pretty big range to how various mint flavors actually register.\n\n**Apexified:**  So nobody.  Nobody care.\n\n**Me:**  Finding your mint is an intensely personal process in which you assess what type of mint you want, how little body you'll tolerate, and how much mentholation you can stand.  \n\nOn the brutal side, you can start out with something like straight menthol.  Almost no actual \"mint\" flavor and a pretty sharp and vaguely unpleasant cooling bite on the front of your vape.  \n\nSlightly less brutal, something like FW Extreme Ice which is still mostly mentholation but has some nice, sweeter spearmint and peppermint notes right around the edges.\n\nYou then have some really aggressive mint flavors that still lean hard into mentholation but have a clearer flavor to them.  Something like  Inawera Mix Mint is still brutal, but gives you a really clear flavor.  Same with an aggressive peppermint like Flavorah.\n\nWonder Flavours Double Mint fits into my own personal sweet spot: Fairly heavy but not chemical tasting menthol, clear mint flavor, and just enough body to really make it palatable as a single flavor.\n\nMints get a bit sweeter and less heavy mentholated working up to like Flavourart Spearmint or FW Natural Spearmint onto full mint candy territory like CAP Cool Mint or LB Vanilla Mint.\n\nI sort of wish this was heavier on the spearmint rather the peppermint, but hey...  I've vaped a lot of this stuff.\n\n**Apexified:**  Just make a bonafide shit post about how you've transcended flavor.\n\n[The Reddit DIY Flavor Review Archive](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)",

I understand why they didn't label this a green apple jolly rancher, it's mostly a green taste. On the inhale you get mostly a green, vague impression of what might be a green apple under a chemical astringent taste. It's almost like the first taste of a green apple jolly rancher for the first .5 seconds you put it in your mouth and the waxyish taste goes away. On exhale you get an unexpected caramel note. Overall this flavor is very saccharine, i wouldn't go so far as to call it cloying but medium artificial sugary note that's kind of off putting for what it's intended use should be.\n\n\n**Off-flavors:** Chemically artificial sugar flavor with an unexpected caramel on exhale\n\n**Throat Hit:** 5/10\n\n**Uses & Pairings:** Maybe bolster with a more authentic green apple? inw antone/fw green apple with a dash of fuji and a slash of caramel to bring out the off note more?\n\n**Notes:** Again with the artificial sugar flavor from Wonder Flavors. it really tastes less like a green apple jolly rancher and more like one of [these](http://i.imgur.com/2NoI8Qe.jpg). After about a week the caramel fades more into the background but really that just leaves the chemical green flavor a bit more prominent. The throat hit is real on this one. Even at a week in i could feel it and i'm **not** particularly sensitive to throat hit.\n\ne: missing words",

As a vape i got watermelonish/pink candy inhale with an aspartame? exhale. very artificial sugary not very sour. Vapor production i would describe as fluffy without being dense trending on the drier side.

Of the three Wonder Flavors i've tried they're all of the candy variety and all come with a aspartame/saccharin note of varying degrees. i guess this is the sweet and/or sour part of the name? At lower percentages it's not as prevalent but the higher you go the more it shows up and will taper down just a bit after 3 days and holds at that level throughout a week. \n\n\n",

Very sweet flavor. It isn't a very dark or spicy vanilla just light and smooth.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Nothing weird going on here tastes exactly how it ought to.\n\n**Throat Hit:** A little stingy on the exhale but goes away after a few puffs.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I will be using this a lot like vanilla swirl, anywhere I want a creamy sweet vanilla added. This will sweeten up any mix and would be really good in custards and bakeries. I can see this pairing very well with caramels/butterscotches, nuts, darker fruits. This would also be a good helper with vbic.\n\n**Notes:** There is nothing special or noteworthy about this flavor, it is just a good sweet plain vanilla, making it a pretty versatile flavor if you have it but not something I would go out of my way to purchase. If your preffered vendor carries it it is worth throwing it in your cart, otherwise you can do without it if you have vanilla swirl or inw vanilla shisha. \n\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**",

It's pretty accurate to how I imagine a yellow watermelon to be. Can taste it's a bit different to a red watermelon. It's more mellow, although doesn’t lack flavour, and has an almost honey-ish note. Has a nice juiciness and I get a little bit of rind. Overall it's pretty refreshing. I also get some lingering watermelon flesh and rind after exhaling. \n\nMouthfeel/ Texture: its pretty juicy. I pick up on a bit of graininess/ mealiness, like watermelon flesh. \n\nOff Notes: none\n\nThroat Hit: none\n\n% Testing: at 2.5% it's pretty full flavoured. I’d probably use it a bit lower in a mix. Maybe around 1% as an accent, 2% as a main note? \n\nUse and Pairings: anywhere you want a more mellow, less aggressive watermelon that is going to sit a bit further back in the mix, rather than being right up front. Would be good in a melon mix or fruit mix. Or a cocktail/ beverage. \nBecause it's pretty refreshing I'd like to try pairing it with other refreshing flavours, maybe something like cucumber or citrus to make a nice summery vape.",

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Wrecka Japanese Aloe Vera, 2 and 4%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 15 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Aloe vera drink, with some built in sweetener and cooling.\n\n[I picked these up from Chef's](https://www.chefsflavours.co.uk/215-wrecka-concentrates) as \"Wrecka\" but they are apparently rebottled Malaysian Reka flavors.\n\nThe actual flavor here is fairly accurate to [japanese aloe vera drinks.](https://japancentre-images.freetls.fastly.net/images/pics/7683/large/original.jpg?1469565048)  It isn't actually too intensely green or vegetal, it more tastes like white grapes with an especially astringent skin like Muscat grapes.  Apparently the more raw, less processed types of aloe get pretty intense, but this is pretty mellow and strangely familiar overall.  There's a nice balance of a brighter tartness and sweetness behind it.  That green note is more vibrant than vegetal.\n\nThe flavor here is a bit thin and dry.  That cooling is wiping out most of the base of this flavor.  This feels like it needs something juicier to fill the flavor back in.\n\nThe cooling, and sweetener here seem pretty identical to [Wrecka Sparkling Orange.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/77z4ky/wreckareka_sparkling_orange/)  I make some half-educated guesses and go into more depth on those aspects in that review.\n\nJust as a summary here,  the cooling here feels like a slightly more cardboard version of WS-23 then I'm used to. It's still not an overwhelming cooling, and not too aggressively icy.  Feels like under .5% of 30% WS-23 with this concentrate at 4%. \n\nThe sweetener feels a little different from straight sucralose.  It's noticeably sweet but not cloying, at least for the percentages I'd be using so the cooling didn't go full cardboard.\n\nThis doesn't have the \"sparkling\" prefix, but it does have that same kind of mouthfeel as the sparkling wrecka concentrates I tried.  The cooling and sweetener does manage to give this something like an effervescence.\n\n**Off-flavors:**   Besides that cardboard edge to the cooling, not really. I'm not noticing any weirdness from the sweetener, and nothing tastes overwhelmingly odd at 4% and under.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  A bit, but that's mostly the cooling. Nothing that feels like a chemical throat hit though.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 2% the actual aloe flavor feels pretty thin.  I mostly taste a light white grape and then a little bit of cooling and a whole lot of sweetener.  Overall texture is thin.  I'm still picking up a tiny bit of cardboard to the cooling, but it's pretty subtle.\n\n4% is a little juicier and that aloe flavor has filled in quite a bit.  Still feels thin in the base, but the top of the flavor is fairly full.  The sweetener seems like it has a bit more flavor to actually latch onto and seems to work a bit better at this percentage.  The cooling and that thinner base is getting sort of flat and it's getting that cardboard note.\n\nTrying this higher at 8%, I'm getting too much sweetener and it's popping out that greener tinge to the flavor.  Doesn't feel much fuller than 4%.\n\nJust based on these tests, I'd probably use this as primary flavor with something juicier to fill it out at around 4%.  [The product page on Chef's suggests 1-4%.](https://www.chefsflavours.co.uk/wrecka-concentrates/5505-japanese-aloe-vera-wrecka.html)\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This is a little bit green and already has sweetener and cooling, so you're probably just looking at fruit mixes and beverage vapes.\n\nI think you could fill this out a bit with a white grape flavor.  I'd probably use FLV Moscato because it has that same kind of green note in there.  Should pair well with lychee, melon, kiwi, strawberry, or any kind of citrus.  Good base to try work in some greener florals like hibiscus or jasmine as well.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Nothing about this flavor specifically, but there was a recent thread discussing these flavors.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/75zj4c/wrekareker_malaysian_concentrates_stumbled_on/)\n\nGreat discussion, the takeaways include:\n\nceedee99uk: These are rebottled Reka concentrates.\n\nJorakae: They separate in mixes above 50% VG.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Wrecka Sexy Mango, 2 and 4%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 14 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  A ripe to overripe sweetened realistic mango, with a mild cooling to it.\n\n[I picked these up from Chef's](https://www.chefsflavours.co.uk/215-wrecka-concentrates) as \"Wrecka\" but they are apparently rebottled Malaysian Reka flavors.\n\nThere's a pretty competent mango in here.  The base mango is sweeter, and fairly accurate.  The sweetener here pulls it a little bit toward candy or sweetened mango nectar, but there's some nuance and depth to the flavor with a slightly dry but solid base mango flavor.  It stops short of a full on pulpy mango base, and could probably use a bit more body, but the bones of a realistic mango flavor are there.\n\nI do get an overripe note.  Whereas CAP's sweet mango has a more vegetal, swampy overripeness this is more on the bready side of things.  It's a pretty accurate overripe note, picking up that weird, almost chalky fermented kind of edge that meatier fruits get.  Sort of comparable the overripe note in FLV Jackfruit, but less intense overall.  At a lower concentration, the fresher mango is actually pretty well balanced with the overripe notes.  The end result is actually pretty realistic although this still seems to need something just a bit more juicy to really fill it out.\n\nWith that said, my testers of this smelled absolutely horrendous. I don't usually do the \"in the bottle\" thing, but whatever is giving this that overripe note is extremely present even for the 2% mix.  There's a really strong green malt smell to this.  I had to double check to make sure my bottles were clean, but it smells exactly like FW Malt.  It's a potent enough odor that i find myself pulling my rda away from my face a bit quicker, because I can smell it in the rda after vaping.  I have no idea why it smells this strongly, but it doesn't seem to translate into the actual vape to nearly the same degree.  I wouldn't call anything this pungent \"sexy,\" but I'm also not here to judge your turn-ons.\n\nI'm still getting some sweetener and cooling in here, although both seem less pronounced than the Sparkling Mango and Sparkling Orange I had previously tested.  I get a really slight hit of cooling on the back of this.  It's just enough to clean up the exhale a bit, without adding any noticeable cardboard taste.  The sweetener also seems a bit less obnoxious than the Sparkling flavors.  It's definitely still present, but the thicker flavor here holds up to it better than the sparkling flavors.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Not nearly sexy enough.  That bready, overripe fermented note gets out of control pretty quickly.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  A little bit from the cooling.  Other than that, it's fairly smooth.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 2% I get a realistic mango with a bit too much sweetener and a light cooling edge.  The mango has a good balance of overripe notes and fresh mango, ends up tasting fairly ripe. That mango flavor does feel a bit thin though, and needs something a bit heavier in the base.\n\nAt 4% this feels a bit too sweet and a bit too ripe.  The heavier sweetener and those overripe notes can get offputting.  Cooling is still pretty light, but the sweetener seems too aggressive.  Definitely pushing towards overripe here, and the cooling is making this feel no thicker than the 2% test.\n\nTesting this higher at 6% it feels closer to rotten.  That bready note is more assertive and that sweetener is just too high for me.\n\nJust based on these tests, I'd use this an accent flavor at 2-3% behind a fuller fruit.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This feels a bit more versatile than the sparkling mango, primarily because that cooling is cranked up as high.  I think could actually be used as a component in more complex mixes.  2% of this would work well in fruit mixes that are going to have something more vibrant in the front of the recipe.  Should add sweetness and ripeness to tropical fruit mixes, and the cooling here won't be out of place for a fruit recipe.\n\nIf you wanted to fill this out, you should be able to use this a lot like CAP Sweet Mango and combine this with FLV Mango.\n\nAt a lower percentage, this isn't going to be cool enough to completely rule out mixing with a cream, although it's probably too cold for warmer bakery applications.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Nothing about this flavor specifically, but there was a recent thread discussing these flavors.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/75zj4c/wrekareker_malaysian_concentrates_stumbled_on/)\n\nGreat discussion, the takeaways include:\n\nceedee99uk: These are rebottled Reka concentrates.\n\nJorakae: They separate in mixes above 50% VG.

More of a one shot, or a one shot that will take some accents, than a more traditional concentrate.\n\n[I picked these up from Chef's](https://www.chefsflavours.co.uk/215-wrecka-concentrates) as \"Wrecka\" but they are apparently rebottled Malaysian Reka flavors.\n\nThe mango flavor here is pretty solid.  I get more of a sweetened mango nectar than a fresh mango, but it's pretty realistic for a mango nectar.  I do get some pulpy juiciness here, but the base is thinned out by the cooling.  There's some warmth here that feels like it's clashing with the cooling rather than really working with it.  The mango here definitely feels sweetened, but it doesn't cross into full candied.\n\nNothing overripe or earthy sticks out here.  There's a small hint of a more realistic underripe mango peel pine here, but it works really well as an accent.  One of the better mangoes I've tasted, but the thinness in the base from the cooling is a bit of a bummer.\n\nThe sparkling, cooling, and sweetener here seem pretty identical to [Wrecka Sparkling Orange.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/77z4ky/wreckareka_sparkling_orange/)  I make some half-educated guesses and go into more depth on those aspects in that review.\n\nJust as a summary here,  the cooling here feels like a slightly more cardboard version of WS-23 then I'm used to.  It seems to be just a hair less cardboardy than the sparkling orange, but that's probably because the base on this feels a bit fuller.

It's noticeably sweet but not cloying, at least for the percentages I'd be using so the cooling didn't go full cardboard.\n\nThis doesn't taste quite as \"sparkling\" as the orange mostly because of the warmth of the underlying mango, but it's same basic effect.  The sweetener and cooling coupled with a beverage type flavor kind of emulates a carbonated effect.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Besides that cardboard edge to the cooling, not really.  I'm not noticing any weirdness from the sweetener, and nothing tastes overwhelmingly odd at 4% and under.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  A bit, but that's mostly the cooling.  Nothing that feels like a chemical throat hit though.\n\nThe combination of that ws-23's sharpness on the lips and the warmer mango gets to be a bit rough on my lips with extended vaping.  Not quite throat hit, but probably worth mentioning.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 2% this mango actually feels a bit heavier.  I'm getting a mango nectar with light cooling here.  The warmth of that mango flavor is actually a bit distracting without enough cooling to clean it up.  Picking up a light cardboard edge to the cooling.\n\nAt 4% I'm getting a better balance of mango and cooling.  It doesn't feel quite as warm, and the cooling is actually taming some of the warmth from the mango. The base of the mango feels just a bit thinner, but the top end has a relatively saturated flavor.  Again, that cardboard note is showing up on the very tail end.  Sweetness level is definitely present but not cloying.\n\nJust trying this out higher at 8%, this is sickeningly sweet and the cooling tastes fairly stale.  I'm actually losing the nuance of the mango behind the sweetener.\n\n[The product page from Chef's recommends mixing between 2-10%.  I'd stay on the lower side of that, just based on my tests here.  I feel like this is going to be better down around 3-4% where the mango, sweetener, and cooling are in a better balance and the cooling doesn't go too cardboard on me.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This is a fruit flavor with cooling and sweetener added, so you're pretty much locked into fruit and beverage mixes.  That kind of cardboard note on the cooling doesn't usually work well with creams.\n\nThis is a fairly competent single flavor mix, but it'd probably be better with something deep and juicy like FLV Mango, a juicy yellow peach flavor like JF Honey Peach, or even a juicier pineapple like CAP Golden Pineapple.  This isn't as thin as the sparkling orange in the base, but it feels like it could still use just a bit of help.\n\nOther than trying to fix the base, go nuts on fruit and beverage pairings that would normally go well with mango.  I feel like this would work better with brighter fruits like strawberry than the sparkling orange.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Nothing about this flavor specifically, but there was a recent thread discussing these flavors.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/75zj4c/wrekareker_malaysian_concentrates_stumbled_on/)\n\nGreat discussion, the takeaways include:\n\nceedee99uk: These are rebottled Reka concentrates.\n\nJorakae: They separate in mixes above 50% VG.

Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Wrecka Sparkling Orange, 2 and 4%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 12 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  An artificial soda type orange flavor with built in cooling and sweetener.  Pretty much a one shot to accent around.\n\nSo a general disclaimer, I'm not at all familiar with Malaysian juices in general.  I've just heard them described as intensely icy, usually using ws-23 (or ws-23 and ws-5 in conjunction) and heavily sweetened.  [I picked these up from Chef's](https://www.chefsflavours.co.uk/215-wrecka-concentrates) as \"Wrecka\" but they are apparently rebottled Malaysian Reka flavors.\n\nThe orange here tastes on the artificial side.  It's a pretty decent artificial orange, not quite as vibrant as an orange crush type soda flavor, but in the same family.  I'm not picking anything like a realistic zest note or juiciness.  Basically a bright commercial, almost candy orange.\n\nThis is there \"sparkling\" orange, and I do get something that tastes very mildly carbonated-ish.  I think it's mostly the sweetener and the flavor kind of tasting like soda, and the cooling making the flavor hit my palate a bit like a soda would.  Probably more association than an actual tactile mouthfeel.\n\nGiven what I had heard about Malaysian juices, I was expecting straight icicles.  I didn't really get that, at least the percentages tested.  There's cooling here, but I'm getting it more as a tactile sharpness toward my lips than a heavy cooling sensation.  That sort of sensation does line up with what I get from ws-23, and the actual cooling effect feels like a relatively low percentage of 30% WS-23.  At 4% of this concentrate, the actual cooling effect seems like it's weaker than .5% WS-23.  I'm not sure if WS-23 is the only cooling they are using though.  Theres a weird cardboard taste in the base of the flavor I associate more closely with WS-3 (or straight koolada.)  It definitely doesn't feel like ws-5.  If they are using just WS-23 it doesn't feel like a particularly \"clean\" cooling like the ws-23 I've been mixing from crystals or the stuff I've purchased from chef's.\n\nThere's also quite a bit of sweetener here.  Jorakae, in the thread in the second opinions section, is much more familiar with Reka than I am.  They said it feels like there is something besides just sucralose going on here, and I could see that.  I'm not great with sweetener identification, but just tasting this back of the hand, you notice something that feels quite a bit different from just the thinner, bitter taste of straight sucralose.  It tastes a lot more like FLV Sweetness, which is a stevia derivative.  I didn't notice any stevia off flavors while using this concentrate, and it seems to be sweeter off a shake than stevia, but I really wouldn't be surprised if this was using both some sucralose, and something that worked more like Stevia.  Sweetness level is definitely present, but not overwhelming.  At 2% of this concentrate it seemed maybe a bit less sweet than .5% of 10% Sucralose.  That cardboard note from the cooling would limit me percentage-wise before the sweetener.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Besides that cardboard edge to the cooling, not really.  I'm not noticing any weirdness from the sweetener, and nothing tastes overwhelmingly odd at 4% and under.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  A bit, but that's mostly the cooling.  Nothing that feels like a chemical throat hit though.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 2% the orange here doesn't quite feel saturated.  There's a decent mid and top flavor here, but it feels like it's lacking some base.  Solidly sweet but not cloying.  The cooling is also feeling fairly present.  I wouldn't call it icy, but it feels fairly close to .25-.3% of 30% WS-23.\n\nAt 4% the orange is a bit better. Still feels a bit thin in flavor down low, but there is a solid orange here.  Sweetness level is pushing oversweet for me, but it's still manageable and I haven't noticed any major coil gore after vaping 10ml.  The biggest issue is the cooling, I feel like it's starting to pick up some WS-3 kind of cardboard.\n\nThe chef's product suggests a range from 2%-10%.  At 8% there was way too much sweetener for me, and I noticed some muddy flatness after a couple drags.  That cardboard taste was also way too prominent.\n\nJust based on these tests, I feel like the cooling is probably the biggest limiting factor for percentage, not because of the coolness but that weird cardboard note.  I'd probably use this around 3%.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This is a fruit flavor with cooling and sweetener added, so you're pretty much locked into fruit and beverage mixes.  That kind of cardboard note on the cooling doesn't usually work well with creams.\n\nThis is a fairly competent single flavor mix, but it'd probably be better with something deep and juicy like FLV Mango, a juicy yellow peach flavor like JF Honey Peach, or even a juicier pineapple like CAP Golden Pineapple.  If you wanted to stick with orange-ish flavors, I could see this working better with a heavier, waxier orange flavor like FA Mandarin, FW Blood Orange, or FLV Orange Citrus.\n\nOther than trying to fix the base a bit, go nuts on fruit and beverage pairings that would normally go well with oranges.  Good base for a mimosa type flavor with some TPA Champagne.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Nothing about this flavor specifically, but there was a recent thread discussing these flavors.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/75zj4c/wrekareker_malaysian_concentrates_stumbled_on/)\n\nGreat discussion, the takeaways include:\n\nceedee99uk: These are rebottled Reka concentrates.\n\nJorakae: They seperate in mixes above 50% VG.
