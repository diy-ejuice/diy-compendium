I was hoping to put together a more definitive list that could maximize flavor buying efficiency but every which way you look at it you end up 1 or more flavors short of making the next best thing.</p>\n<p>Making the most top rated recipes while buying the fewest flavors is still possible, you just have to find the ones that pique your interest and favorite them on ATF (click the little star next to the recipe name) and then you can go to the menu and click \"Needed Flavors\" to get a list of the flavors that aren't already in your stash.</p>\n<p>I realized you need to be a pro member to favorite recipes so I decided to ask /u/queuetue (5 minutes ago) if he would do a <strong><a href=\"https://alltheflavors.com/go_pro\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Memorial Day free month of ATF</a></strong> and he said yes. So if you're not already a member and you want to try it out for free you can use the coupon <strong>FAQ-MD-2018</strong> for a free month of ATF. The code will work until Tuesday morning and is good for the first 100 people who use it.</p>\n<p>If you're interested here are the spreadsheets I made to \"analyze\" the data.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1o8F3OobpQhdWoO8Wvt4XCj5iENE52zZdLNuoFhdiUko/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Top 50 Recipes</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ofpZI2rnFTgwzvgS-t7dNmIC_Stv7Mur_Mhkdz8Pw9Q/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Top 100 Flavors</a></p>\n<p>With the top 100 flavors you can sort the data to see things like which flavors are the cheapest when used at their average percentage or which flavors are in recipes with the most reviews, etc. Trivial but interesting stuff, I think.</p>\n<p>Hopefully this can help you pick a few new flavors or help kick off your first order from one the the vendors doing <a href=\"https://redd.it/8ly79u\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Memorial Day Sales</a>.</p>","frontmatter":{"author":null,"title":"Flavors - BEST Flavors","description":null}}},"pageContext":{"html":"<p>BEST isn't very easy to quantify but I'll try anyway because this is definitely a Frequently Asked Question.

I was hoping to put together a more definitive list that could maximize flavor buying efficiency but every which way you look at it you end up 1 or more flavors short of making the next best thing.</p>\n<p>Making the most top rated recipes while buying the fewest flavors is still possible, you just have to find the ones that pique your interest and favorite them on ATF (click the little star next to the recipe name) and then you can go to the menu and click \"Needed Flavors\" to get a list of the flavors that aren't already in your stash.</p>\n<p>I realized you need to be a pro member to favorite recipes so I decided to ask /u/queuetue (5 minutes ago) if he would do a <strong><a href=\"https://alltheflavors.com/go_pro\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Memorial Day free month of ATF</a></strong> and he said yes. So if you're not already a member and you want to try it out for free you can use the coupon <strong>FAQ-MD-2018</strong> for a free month of ATF. The code will work until Tuesday morning and is good for the first 100 people who use it.</p>\n<p>If you're interested here are the spreadsheets I made to \"analyze\" the data.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1o8F3OobpQhdWoO8Wvt4XCj5iENE52zZdLNuoFhdiUko/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Top 50 Recipes</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ofpZI2rnFTgwzvgS-t7dNmIC_Stv7Mur_Mhkdz8Pw9Q/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Top 100 Flavors</a></p>\n<p>With the top 100 flavors you can sort the data to see things like which flavors are the cheapest when used at their average percentage or which flavors are in recipes with the most reviews, etc. Trivial but interesting stuff, I think.</p>\n<p>Hopefully this can help you pick a few new flavors or help kick off your first order from one the the vendors doing <a href=\"https://redd.it/8ly79u\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Memorial Day Sales</a>.</p>","title":"Flavors - BEST Flavors"}},
