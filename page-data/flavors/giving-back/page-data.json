It really does get annoying. If you're brand new, almost all of your questions have already been answered many times. So many times in fact that the Wiki here is filled with answers to those questions. Please take the time to do a tiny bit of reading before posting. You might be surprised that while you're looking for the answer to <em>Question A</em>, you find <em>Question B</em>, <em>Question C</em>, <em>Question D</em>, etc. that you haven't even thought to ask yet.</p>\n<p>The recent Flavor Bans have brought a horde of new mixers into the fold and with then an endless wave of newbie questions, That means these (already answered) questions push much of the good info (like the FOTW post) off of the front page very quickly. That makes some of the folks that contribute helpful info to think \"what's the point of posting?\" when their message is blown off the front page by posts like this => <em>\"I'm new - tell me everything I need to do.\"</em> If you don't think that happens very often, check out the reddit-diy-posts channel on the <a href=\"https://discord.gg/dUsMehj\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DIY_eJuice Discord Server</a>. You can see what's been posted even after our axe-wielding Moderator /u/EdibleMalfunction has zapped it.

When I started, I had only been mixing my own juice for a few months. Even now my flavor stash barely exceeds 100 flavors - so I am not even in the same zip code as the experts. But it doesn't mean that I can't contribute something. And now, ID10-T actually ask for MY opinion on things (hahaha). I guess he's really trying to earn his status as an <strong>IDIOT</strong>! (hahaha)</p>\n<p>The lovely u/GlassChalice468 (aka Dragon Lady) joined the Mixer Showdown after an incredibly short time mixing and helped create <a href=\"https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/155578#golden_snozzberry_custard_by_diy_discord\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Golden Snozzberry Custard</a> which u/ID10-T nominated for*\"Recipe of the Year\"*. And considering his track record at picking winners, don't be surprised if it wins.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Don't be intimidated</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Remember that all of the people you view as \"Experts\" are … people! There's no reason to feel intimidated. They may know more about mixing eJuice than you do, but that doesn't mean that they're unapproachable. Hell, most of them are extremely friendly and helpful. They're not only willing to talk about DIY, they also have \"regular lives\" just like the rest of us normal folks. I had the pleasure to chat with several of the \"Notable Names\" of the DIY World while organizing the <em>Mixer Showdowns</em>. At first I assumed that I would be \"bowing in reverence\" to their greatness. But what I found was that they're <strong>ALL</strong> incredibly easy to talk to. Here's a few things that I learned …</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>u/ConcreteRiver is a Jolly Big Boy that will gladly share his wealth of knowledge. But hide all of your fruit before chatting with him. And if he starts to take his shirt off - <strong>RUN!</strong> (grin)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>u/AlfredPudding is truly the RainMan of the DIY Community. And he's very friendly. He bent over backward to help me recruiting for the Mixer Showdown. Thanks again Alf!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>u/mlNikon is the lovable Sweetheart we all know from Noted. She puts up with ID10-T's shennanigans and keeps the boys in check. She also chose her screenname to take a jab at Wayne (the DIY or Die guy).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>u/NaChef is not only a good mixer - he's a musician. (Keyboard - in case you're wondering) Check him out <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_tXLEQv_aE&#x26;ytbChannel=null\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>HERE</strong></a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>u/matthewkocanda (aka CokeCan) tries to pose as a social malcontent, but put him in front of a Monopoly board and he turns into a little kid.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>u/Kittybit8 is a guy - not a girl! (hahaha) Sorry about that one Kitty!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>u/folkart2000 is actually is very accomplished craftsman. <a href=\"http://www.steveabeepottery.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Take a look.</a>. And for the record, he does NOT have an accent, he talks normally. It's all of the rest of you that have accents. Southern Boys gotta stick together - right folkart? (grin)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>u/Tamberina1 (aka TamVapes) is a <a href=\"https://www.flavorah.com/featured-mixer-tam-vapes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SURVIVOR</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>u/CheebaSteeba - If you take an Uber and hear \"Delosi - it's delightfully mediocre - use at 5%\" your driver probably has a beard and wears glasses.

I seriously doubt that, but The Silk Man makes <a href=\"https://alltheflavors.com/users/Silky?sort_order=rating&#x26;name_like=\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">some mighty fine juice</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>u/Apexified tries hard to imitate the Wizard of Oz. If you listen closely you can hear him saying \"Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain\". But just take a quick survey the FAQ's in the wiki and you'll notice that 90% of them are written by one person … I wonder who that could be? (smirk)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If these people will talk to (and greatly help) a neophyte like me, surely they'll talk to you too. So don't be scared. Just remember to be polite and <strong>ASK</strong>, don't <strong>DEMAND</strong>. I think you'll be happy that you did.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Now that I've rambled off topic for too long (smirk) let me state a few facts about the topic at hand - <strong>Noted</strong> and <strong>FOTW</strong>. I have cataloged virtually everything that has transpired on Noted and FOTW (along with several other sources of info about flavors).

The upcoming episode on Toffee should just about finish off the possible flavors for FOTW unless you include the obscure nooks and crannies like Wine or Cream Soda.</p>\n<p>You've probably seen the weekly \"Single Flavor Test\" threads posted by /u/RancerDS . Have you noticed that in (almost) all of them, our good friend ID10-T has added an incredible \"Flavor RoundUp\" for the previous FOTW?
