I dont think this is the most appealing description but it almost tastes like a sweet woody dark perfume. That's a horrible description, but it has that kind of unusual combination of flavors you sort of see in TPA RY4 Asian while being on this side of the tasty line. It would still need a deft hand to make work in a mix, yet seems particularly worth the effort. Already I'm thinking that at 1-2% this could be that 'secret ingredient' for spiced bacco blends or even maybe spiced bakeries. The main notes I'm getting are a bit of leafy mixed with some darker notes all bended into a sweetness that makes it seem like an RY1 Asian. If you like that novelty factor of RY4 Asian, but want to start with something a bit less aggressively odd, this could be what you are missing. And, who are we kidding, it's TPA so it is definitely affordable if not also easy to find (both bcf and diyvs carry this flavor as of posting).\nDK has this dark base note, with that bit of leaf that isn't brittle or off putting even at 4% like I could imagine FA 7 Leaves being that high. I really do wish I could explain it better but it defies description since it tastes sweet and slightly acrid without being bad at all. There's a touch of a slight floral hint that can sometimes come across a bit golden but it's so attached to that unique leafiness it's more like golden leaves with a hint of an odd sort of sour note that can be off putting if you arent into it. I'm into it both for novelty and because I think it can easily be bent into a golden blend or some kind of honey/nut mix.</p>\n<p><em>Suggested percent:</em> Solo 2-4%, in a mix 1-2% should be sufficient with 3 probably being the highest I would go unless paired with something much darker and richer.</p>\n<p><em>Pairing ideas:</em> You could probably do all kinds of weird things with this and fruits that would take to a bit of a leafy honey golden note.
