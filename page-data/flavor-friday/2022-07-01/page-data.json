It smells dry and golden.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong>\n3% - At a week, this presents as a dry yet sweet plain tobacco. The flavor here is fairly present which can sometimes be hit or miss with the Hangsens and there is a faint note of AP that I can imagine getting bolder at higher percents, maybe without being offensive. Overall, it's a decent tobacco flavor but the sweetness just really got to me. at this percentage, I'm getting a slight off-note I cant seem to identify and, without pushing this flavor up higher to find out, I'm unwilling to try it any higher than at the 3% I have it at here. It's an almost but not quite floral note. There's a hint of smokiness, but not like an ashy type, more like a woodsy one but even not quite there and it's kinda hard to pin down with all that sugariness which just ruins it for me. My mind wants to associate it with desserty type things and I just cant see using this in anything other than a sweeter blend.</p>\n<p><em>Suggested percent:</em> main note 2-4%, in a mix: 1-2%</p>\n<p><em>Pairing ideas:</em> I'd use this for dry and/or nutty plain bacco blends. I could see this being good in a simple mix with a proper pairing like HS FC 4% + FLV Virginia 1.5% (and maybe 0.5-1 of anything else for variety). Could be a perfect rotating Pod Mix. A little gold ducat here, a little 555 there, a bit of burley today, some sweet and smoky tomorrow</p>\n<p>As for me, I think I would boost that nut note and maybe even add a little bit of a less sweet vanilla cream or custard notes like WF Ruyan Custard, since it is already sweet. Or just use it low with an ry4 and get your sweet tooth on.

Kind of unusual to me. My Dapper Remix still needs a bit of work. After a longer steep, I had to admit the vanilla note was way too prominent so I'd have to adjust that vanilla for pipe in it down a bit for longer steep times. It way overpowered most everything else. In the end, I think Flue Cured is a decent enough flavor that doesn't fall prey to the need for higher percentage like some other Hangsen's I'm discovering, yet there's a range still possible for this and most of them. Overall, too sweet to be a main note for me over say 4% but still a useful enough flavor for someone who maybe wants to deep dive, likes their baccos sweet, or just likes to pay at least $4 per 10 mL used at 4-5%. I kid. As far as baccos go, I'd say this is mid range and maybe a little boring, which I suspect will appeal to someone out there. That said, the dryness would definitely have its usefulness and be a nice mellow add for when a neutral bacco flavor is needed that brings dryness and a bit of sweet. That sweet and dry combo is a bit of a rarity ime so that bumps this flavor up a bit in my mind, if also making it a bit more niche, especially combined with how more or less mild it appears to be overall.</p>\n<p>-i</p>","frontmatter":{"author":"isuamadog","title":"Flavor Review Friday - HS Flue Cured","description":null}}},"pageContext":{"html":"<h2 id=\"hs-flue-cured-ha-at-diyvs\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#hs-flue-cured-ha-at-diyvs\" aria-label=\"hs flue cured ha at diyvs permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>HS Flue Cured (HA at diyvs)</h2>\n<p><strong>Setup</strong>: mtl STNG 0.8 Ohm 2.0 ID 28/40 clapton 28.5W</p>\n<p><strong>nose:</strong> faint tobacco and AP dryness.
