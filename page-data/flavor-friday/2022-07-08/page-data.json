Like this for me is the perfect RY4. Meaning, it is the caramel + tobacco that I really want. This has it both already mixed. Normally I would hate this kind of mixed flavor because I could do better myself but, in this case, it's lovely. Golden caramel smoothness with a light bacco finish. I love this. I heard this one is a steeper but I'm not believing it. I can't wait to see how this one steeps out. I can totally see this paired with apple and I know it will work because I tried it before (see Pairing Ideas below).</p>\n<p>At 7 days, I'm still getting that golden caramel on the inhale. It's a little hard to describe because it is very well blended into the flavor. It reminds me of the flavor of the caramel on a candy apple without all the tackiness in the texture and more of in how it wraps this genuinely mild tobacco in a wrapper of golden goodness. It's way less musky of a flavor than sweet cigarette but that's the most relatable flavor I can compare it to. Mild Tobacco has hints of earthiness with moments of almost woody, almost oaky, but it never quite goes there. I'd say it's 60 caramel/40 bacco and both kinda toned down a bit, neither one being an aggressive flavor. This is definitely a marriage or respectful partners. I could totally and completely see folks using this as a standalone without question. Due to its relatively neutral presence in any one category -- tobacco, sweet, caramel, woodiness -- I see no reason why this flavor couldn't bear the brunt of a real nice mellow introductory tobacco vape. You could amplify any one aspect of all of these into something that was unique and yet hit all your spots. A dash of bacco here, caramel there, burnt notes, apple or fruit, a bit of nut, creaminess, etc. This is I think one of the best Flavorah flavors to be released for this universal appeal and I expect you will see it kind of crop up in quite a few recipes over time.</p>\n<p>My other relatable flavor would be HS RY1. HS RY1 is a nearly perfect flavor to me in that it has complexity enough to drive a recipe at lower percentage by itself or can be bumped up a bit to play nice and fill out some other recipes while adding a bit of sweetness and complexity. FLV Mild can do exactly that if not more distinctly, in a way that I suspect no one will ever complain about. Lacking a definite tobacco note leaves this flavor up to the imagination of the mixer for where to take it next.</p>\n<p>I'd heard this one is a steeper and I could wait this one out for another week to see where it goes. I have, before, had it over the course of a two month steep. I'll say that I find the flavor at 7 days is pretty much what it will be for the duration of the steep. If it is mixed with other flavors that benefit from a longer steep, great. I think at 7 days you are getting the beginnings of the more or less stable version of the concentrate.</p>\n<p><em>Suggested percent:</em> 2.5% seems to push this to the limit of where I might want it. I'd say as a stronger note or to pull nearly most of the weight in a recipe, I still wouldnt go over 2, I think. At 2.5 MTL, I was at the limit of where the notes appeared to start to stretch into 'too much' territory with a wee hint of sharpness every so often. In a mix, I'd probably stick with 1-1.5 because I would probably be using it for its strengths and can't see myself not wanting a decent amount of that pulling the bulk of the weight of several flavors all at once.</p>\n<p><em>Pairing ideas:</em>\nWhen I first vaped this, it screamed apple to me. It got a solid spot in my Prapple Bacco 2021 recipe I made playing off of fear's original Prapple recipe. I literally can see this being used 100% in place of anywhere where FLV Sweet Cig might have been used. (RIP SwCig) Feature at 2 and just accent it with whatever you like. I mean, it's so <em>mild</em> I can kinda see it going with literally anything.</p>\n<h2 id=\"stats\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#stats\" aria-label=\"stats permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a><strong><em>Stats</em></strong></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://alltheflavors.com/flavors/flavorah-mild-tobacco\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ATF</a>: 14 DIY Public Recipes / Used in <strong>136</strong> private recipes at an average of <strong>1.573%</strong>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/345790\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ELR</a>: Public Recipes: 20 / Average mixing quantity: 1.4% (Median: 1%)</p>\n<p><em>Existing Recipes:</em></p>\n<h1 id=\"prapple-bacco-2021\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#prapple-bacco-2021\" aria-label=\"prapple bacco 2021 permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a><a href=\"https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/235253#prapple_bacco_2021_by_nowar\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Prapple Bacco 2021</a></h1>\n<hr>\n<p>This was a fun one to make.

Sort of like a blonde Vagina [sic] but with more depth of flavour, almost in to being mildly ashy but more like a smokey notes than ash TBF, the tobacco very much leads but is softened &#x26; sophisticated by the accompanied middle ground caramel taste, by middle ground I mean it's not leaning to far towards being creamy or buttery &#x26; not leaning to far in the dark caramelized notes, like the tobacco itself it's very much mild &#x26; mellow yet bold enough to be perceived well, it's RY4esk [sic] but very much more tobacco heavy &#x26; does not have any creamy or nutty notes to it, seems to be pretty complex &#x26; there's no mistaking it as a fairly full on tobacco, it's mildly bitter &#x26; very tobacco authentic.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It will no doubt be a good flavouring to mix with as it's bolt &#x26; full of character, but I can see it being quite the bully so care will be needed if blending this with other flavours.

After 4 weeks, wow, it’s not so mild, a full on cigarette taste for me, with very background caramel. I agree with Frunkster’s notes, particularly the after taste, and reckon this would work wonders in a baccy biscuit mix. Update: After about two and half months steep: it’s calmed down to a very palatable dry tobacco with caramel very much in the background, a good late night vape but a little ‘thin’ for my taste (which is more tobacco custard leaning).

It presented as a fairly complex affair, with the main notes being a mild (duh) tobacco and a very rich caramel ... it had far MORE tobacco, and less caramel ... The tobacco was full but not overly strong or bitter, and the \"caramel wash\" as I was calling it, just envoloped [sic] you during the vape. At times I even got almost smoky notes, but they kept moving in and out of focus, which really just left this one as a deliciously complex blend of a mid dark tobacco, and a very rich, yet not overpowering caramel.

It has a unique taste that covers everything you would want out of a tobacco ry4 balance (unless you want vanilla which is such an easy fix). This can be vaped as a stand alone for people who want an easy one-and-done, bent either way to desserts or less mild tobacco mixes, paired with fruits, etc. I imagine you will see some boozy mixes with it if there aren't already some. Hell, just add some to Tesla's mix if you're lazy. Or, pull a Chainvapor and just work your way up to it from a nice Mild pairing you like.</p>\n<p>Mild Tobacco is an essential flavor in my opinion. Not much else to say.

Lacking a definite tobacco note leaves this flavor up to the imagination of the mixer for where to take it next.</p>\n<p>I'd heard this one is a steeper and I could wait this one out for another week to see where it goes. I have, before, had it over the course of a two month steep. I'll say that I find the flavor at 7 days is pretty much what it will be for the duration of the steep. If it is mixed with other flavors that benefit from a longer steep, great. I think at 7 days you are getting the beginnings of the more or less stable version of the concentrate.</p>\n<p><em>Suggested percent:</em> 2.5% seems to push this to the limit of where I might want it. I'd say as a stronger note or to pull nearly most of the weight in a recipe, I still wouldnt go over 2, I think. At 2.5 MTL, I was at the limit of where the notes appeared to start to stretch into 'too much' territory with a wee hint of sharpness every so often. In a mix, I'd probably stick with 1-1.5 because I would probably be using it for its strengths and can't see myself not wanting a decent amount of that pulling the bulk of the weight of several flavors all at once.</p>\n<p><em>Pairing ideas:</em>\nWhen I first vaped this, it screamed apple to me. It got a solid spot in my Prapple Bacco 2021 recipe I made playing off of fear's original Prapple recipe. I literally can see this being used 100% in place of anywhere where FLV Sweet Cig might have been used. (RIP SwCig) Feature at 2 and just accent it with whatever you like. I mean, it's so <em>mild</em> I can kinda see it going with literally anything.</p>\n<h2 id=\"stats\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#stats\" aria-label=\"stats permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a><strong><em>Stats</em></strong></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://alltheflavors.com/flavors/flavorah-mild-tobacco\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ATF</a>: 14 DIY Public Recipes / Used in <strong>136</strong> private recipes at an average of <strong>1.573%</strong>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/345790\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ELR</a>: Public Recipes: 20 / Average mixing quantity: 1.4% (Median: 1%)</p>\n<p><em>Existing Recipes:</em></p>\n<h1 id=\"prapple-bacco-2021\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#prapple-bacco-2021\" aria-label=\"prapple bacco 2021 permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a><a href=\"https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/235253#prapple_bacco_2021_by_nowar\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Prapple Bacco 2021</a></h1>\n<hr>\n<p>This was a fun one to make.

After 4 weeks, wow, it’s not so mild, a full on cigarette taste for me, with very background caramel. I agree with Frunkster’s notes, particularly the after taste, and reckon this would work wonders in a baccy biscuit mix. Update: After about two and half months steep: it’s calmed down to a very palatable dry tobacco with caramel very much in the background, a good late night vape but a little ‘thin’ for my taste (which is more tobacco custard leaning).

It presented as a fairly complex affair, with the main notes being a mild (duh) tobacco and a very rich caramel ... it had far MORE tobacco, and less caramel ... The tobacco was full but not overly strong or bitter, and the \"caramel wash\" as I was calling it, just envoloped [sic] you during the vape. At times I even got almost smoky notes, but they kept moving in and out of focus, which really just left this one as a deliciously complex blend of a mid dark tobacco, and a very rich, yet not overpowering caramel.

It has a unique taste that covers everything you would want out of a tobacco ry4 balance (unless you want vanilla which is such an easy fix). This can be vaped as a stand alone for people who want an easy one-and-done, bent either way to desserts or less mild tobacco mixes, paired with fruits, etc. I imagine you will see some boozy mixes with it if there aren't already some. Hell, just add some to Tesla's mix if you're lazy. Or, pull a Chainvapor and just work your way up to it from a nice Mild pairing you like.</p>\n<p>Mild Tobacco is an essential flavor in my opinion. Not much else to say. I look forward to your recipes with it.</p>\n<p>-i</p>","title":"Flavor Review Friday - FLV Mild Tobacco"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
