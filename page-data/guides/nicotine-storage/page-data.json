A lot of manufacturers will have to expose the nicotine to oxygen during the manufacturing process, thus beginning the process of oxidation.\nSome vendors will use a supercritical gas to remove the nicotine from the tobacco plant, without exposing it to oxygen.

And inevitably expose them to oxygen.</p>\n<p><strong>The second</strong> cause of oxidation is exposure to light, UV light especially.\nExposure to UV light will cause the nicotine to begin to oxidize and break down almost immediately.</p>\n<p><strong>And the final</strong> cause of oxidation is heat. As well as changes in temperature.\nOxidation occurs more rapidly the hotter it is, conversely, the colder it is the slower oxidation happens.\nHaving constant temperature fluctuations is not great for storage either, ideally you want as little fluctuation in temperature as possible.</p>\n<p>The best way to keep nicotine from oxidizing is to keep it in an amber glass bottle, in a freezer (-20C is the preferred temperature for long term storage).\nThe amber glass will prevent UV light and oxygen from getting to the nicotine in the bottle, and keeping it in the freezer will slow any reaction happening.</p>\n<p>Check out <a href=\"https://glassbottleoutlet.com/collections/boston-round\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GlassBottleOutlet</a> for some decently priced amber glass.</p>\n<h3 id=\"but-what-about-that-pesky-oxygen-in-the-bottle\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#but-what-about-that-pesky-oxygen-in-the-bottle\" aria-label=\"but what about that pesky oxygen in the bottle permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>But what about that pesky oxygen in the bottle?</h3>\n<p>Well that is where using Argon for preserving nicotine can be beneficial. It is a noble gas and does not react with nicotine, PG or VG, and more importantly it is heavier than air, so it will naturally displace any environmental gasses (By volume, dry air contains 78.09% nitrogen, 20.95% oxygen, 0.93% argon, 0.04% carbon dioxide).\nThis will help keep the amount of oxygen as low as possible.</p>\n<p>The best practice is to decant your nicotine into storage bottles ( For example, use 4x the size of your working bottle, so you only have to open any given bottle 4 times.
