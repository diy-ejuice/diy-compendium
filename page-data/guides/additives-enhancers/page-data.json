It can also alter sour/bitter flavors by taming the inherently harsh top notes. And in this case tame is almost interchangeable with mute; EM used as an additive will cause muting when used too high or when used in conjunction with flavors that already contain EM or Maltol (e.g. TFA Strawberry, Bavarian Cream, <a href=\"https://shop.perfumersapprentice.com/specsheetlist.aspx?cas=4940-11-8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">and many more</a>)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\"><strong>Ethyl Vanillin</strong></td>\n<td align=\"center\">2-5x stronger than Vanillin depending on your source of information. <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/u/clinodev\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">/u/clinodev</a> has <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/2zb6aq/difference_between_vanillin_and_ethyl_vannilin/cphh673/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">some notes on usage, layering and sweetness</a>.
