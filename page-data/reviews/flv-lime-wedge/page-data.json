Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Lime Wedge @ 1% and 1 drop per 10 ml (about .25%), 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 8 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  A pretty realistic full lime flavor. I get a good amount of lime flesh, some brighter lime juice, and a not overwhelming hit of lime zest in the top notes. Realistic lime sweet, not candied. I'd use this more for a realistic lime accent, either with other sweeter limes or general fruit mixes.  Fairly concentrated, I'd use between .5-1.5%.\n\nInhale has a bright tart lime right up top, with a slight bitter edge. Not really a heavy zest flavor, more like fresh lime juice. A bit airy on the inhale, but some slightly sweet lime juice in the base. Exhale has a bit fleshier of a texture. Still mostly the middle of the lime, with some bitter top notes without a really heavy lime zest hit.  Mouthfeel overall is a bit airy, but a bit of juice to it. Lingering bitter lime.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Nah.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Moderate.  Not especially harsh for a citrus, but it's still on the harsh end of things.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This actually seems a bit trickier to use than a zest forward higher lime flavor or a sweeter lime candy flavor.  It tastes fairly realistic for a lime, so you'll need a fairly heavy hand to really pick it up in a mix.\n\nSeems a bit too bitter for that heavily commercial type of candy lime or bakery flavor solo. I can see it being used to give some nuance to one of those flavors, but I don't think this will do a great job of showing up by itself.\n\nI think my primary use is going to be in fruit forward flavors. The realistic lime here is going to mix well with fleshier fruits to bring some tartness and brightness, a lot like squeezing lime juice over a fruit salad.\n\nThey say lime wedge, but I'm not thinking it's a go to for lime twists in beverage flavors. I can see it juicier applications, where some actual lime juice is involved, but it doesn't necessarily have that heavy zest hit I'd want for a cocktail accent.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, this is fairly strong but nothing crazy. At .25% I get a clear lime flavor, although it's a bit thin. .5% is pushing towards a full accent, still not a ton of body but a good tartness.  1% has a firmer, fleshier body with a bit of lime juice. Sharper and tarter, but the bitterness isn't out of control. 1.5% is about my usable limit. I'm getting quite a bit warmth and just a tiny hit of wax, but the body has a good balance of flesh and juice and the top notes have picked up a bit more zest. Pretty well balanced here. 2% seems a bit too sharp, and I'm getting some distracting waxiness. I'd recommend using this as an accent at .5% or a complimentary flavor at 1.5%.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nNot really.\n\n[And here is the FLV product page. Their description: \"Real fruit lime is crisp and bright with strong notes of both juice and skin. You can add it to a bit of fried dough and yakima hopps if you are chasing the Hefe or IPA, but it really shines in any thing that needs a citrus punch. \"  What the hell kind of hefeweizen are these people drinking?](http://store.flavorah.com/concentrated-lime-wedge-flavor)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Lime Wedge","url":"https://redd.it/6agcs2","vendor":{"name":"Flavorah","code":"FLV"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FLV","title":"Lime Wedge"}},
