Pulse BF 22 with single spaced SS316L fused clapton @ .22ohm & 75W. Fresh cotton wicks on both. Steeped 19 days.\n\n**My Take:** \n\n - Well, it doesn't taste like burnt popcorn, so that's something...It actually tastes like the little bits of mocha left in the straw that you come back to 15 minutes after you've drunk the cup. However, it doesn't bring anything to the table that you can't find in INW Mocca or SC Cappuccino. Another linear RF flavor, but it's weak at every percentage I tested. Sad, because the flavor seems like it would blend well with other coffee and cream extracts. You'll just find yourself using so much of it that it just makes more sense to use one of the aforementioned concentrates. \n\n**Place in the recipe:**\n\n- Again, the flavor itself isn't bad at all. You're just gonna need to bump the percentage up quite a bit for it to show up in your recipe. I'd suggest starting at 8% and adjusting from there. It should give you some decent mid and back-end notes. I've gone as far as 20% standalone and the flavor still didn't feel pronounced. But that may be a good thing for you. Especially, if you don't like in-your-face coffee flavors.\n\n**Sample Recipe:**\n\n - Sweet Vienna Latte\n\n  - 10% RF Mocha (VG) \n  - 1.5% FLV Sweet Cream\n  - 1% SC Cappuccino\n  - .75% FA Vienna Cream\n  - .5% FA Caramel\n  - 1 drop/10mL TPA Acetyle Pyrazine (optional)\n\n**EDIT:**\n\n**30 days is the sweetspot for this stuff. I was just about to toss my test batches and decided to revisit them. The Mocha has really come to life. It still needs a support, but not as much as I originally assumed.**","author":"RamboUnchained","title":"Mocha VG Version","url":"https://redd.it/72sthl","vendor":{"name":"Real Flavors","code":"RF"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"RF","title":"Mocha VG Version"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
