I get some orange notes in this flavor as well but the chemical lemon is just too overpowering to be sure\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Lemon scented furniture polish\n\n**Throat Hit:**  It is a little stingy on the throat but you could have guessed that by the lemon and the dryness from the cereal note.\n\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I would put this in one of those fragrance warmers in the kitchen!\n\n\n**Notes:**\nI suppose some people may like this. It does have some sweet graininess to it but imo fw fruit rings is so much better. Perhaps I used it at too high of a percentage.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Not much in the way of ELR Notes]http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/60874).\n\n[Here is a recipe that may have salvaged this flavor](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/25463#blueberry_lemon_dump_cake_by_blackblade) by Blackblade. \n\n[People seem to like it on BCF](http://www.bullcityflavors.com/fruity-flakes-fw/)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**\n\nIf you have different opinions on the flavor or any ideas on how to use it please post them in the comments.
