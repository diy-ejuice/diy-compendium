Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Custard @ 1% and 1 drop per 10ml, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 10 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** A medium bodied custard, without the vanilla that you'd usually look for. Relatively subtle flavor, but fairly eggy and rich tasting, without a lot of the weight you'd expect.  Little bit of spice to this, more of a cinnamon mouthfeel, as opposed to a clear taste. A bit weak for flavorah, doesn't really show up until 2% and usable up to about 5%.  [Flavorah put up a GCMS sheet for this, and it apparently has no DAAP, so that explains some of the lack of weight.](http://www.flavorah.com/wp-content/uploads/safety/flavorah_custard_gcms.pdf)  The optimistic view is that is a pretty good custard for being diketone free, the less optimistic view is that it's a bit too thin to really scratch that custard itch.\n\nInhale is fairly airy and subtle up top. Some deeper eggy notes.  They say there's no vanilla in here, but there is a bit of floral spiciness that could be a darker vanilla flavor or maybe a cinnamon.  Exhale has some eggy custard richness up front, with that same kind of mystery light spice in the top notes. I'm going to assume it's cinnamon, because this specifically built to not have the vanilla... but it's close enough.  Flavor is relatively top heavy, with a thinner mouthfeel for a custard. Not a lot going on in the base of the flavor.  Lingering spice and a bit of flatness on the palate.\n\n**Off-flavors:** I get some cinnamon-like spiciness out of this, similar to the vague spicy note in FLV Cream. Steeps out a bit, but still noticeable as low as 1%.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Nothing really.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  It's a bit odd, seems useful for when you want a custard taste, without a bunch of weight.  I'm not 100% sure anyone really wants to go this route, but could be useful for making richer bakeries and creams that don't have a huge bottom end custard fullness.  Does have the advantage of not being particularly \"wet\" so maybe give this a shot if your bakeries are tasting a bit soggy with other flavors.  Might do a better job simulating a bavarian cream than a lot of \"Bavarian Cream\" flavors. Would let you keep a deeper, bready base and effectively layer your custard in the middle of the vape.\n\nThe flavor here is pretty good, so best use may be to fill in the top of a heavier custard base without putting too much weight on the lower end. Also good for getting a custard taste into fruit mixes, without dragging them into a full, heavy custard.\n\nMay have some use getting custard notes into tobaccos, without messing with mouthfeel all that much.\n\nAlso, if you have a thing against delicious diketones, this may fit the bill for you. No rancid dairy butryic kind of note to speak of, which is cool for a diketone free custard.\n\n**Notes:**  Seems a bit weak for Flavorah.  Really light and thin at .25% and .5%.  Flavor starting to show up at 1%. and it's nice, but it still on the thin side.  Not a lot of body. 1.5% is largely the same, good flavor still a bit light. 2% is starting to come together a bit, with some noticeable weight to it.  3% is better, still not heavy but the flavor is approaching good and saturated, worth noting this seems to have a light spice to it unsteeped, dies down a bit after steeping, but I pick up just a bit on cinnamon warmth. 4% have a bit more body still, but nothing too deep. More like a weight in the middle of the vape, as opposed to the low end. Flavor has quite a bit of spice at 4%.  5% doesn't have any more weight, but it's getting drier and moving away from those eggy notes.  6% is too dry and spicy for me.  I'd recommend starting with this at 2% as an accent and working up.  I'm not getting enough full flavor from this really use it as a primary note, and not enough weight for recommending it as an additive at lower percentages.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nNot really.  Lots of info on FLV Vanilla Custard, but the two aren't really comparable. Vanilla Custard is a more traditional custard flavor, Diacetyl and all.\n\n[Heres the Flavorah product page.  Their description: \"Sans vanilla, this custard is the eggy cream. You might get lost without the vanilla notes, but if a plain custard is needed it can be a very useful tool. Not likely to be your standalone shake and vape, but when you use custard as a base note to add depth, and don't need the dominant effects of the vanilla, then this is a better option.\"](http://store.flavorah.com/concentrated-custard-flavor)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Custard","url":"https://redd.it/66cvsy","vendor":{"name":"Flavorah","code":"FLV"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FLV","title":"Custard"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
