I don't really get a dairy or butyric acid note from this which is nice. Works very nicely in the base of a recipe as the sweet cream, as long as that dark sweetness plays well with the other elements. One thing I like about this flavoring is its uniqueness and it's fairly forgiving as long it's paired well, so you can come up with some interesting recipes using it.\n\n**On the Nose**  \nCream with a hint of caramel or some dark sweetness.\n\n**Recommended Usage**  \n*Stand alone*: 3%\n\n*In a mix*: 1-2%. \n\n**Throat**  \nMild to Moderate\n\n**Ideal Pairings**  \nOther creams, nuts, caramel, butterscotch, caramel, banana, cinnamon, vanilla, bakeries\n\n**Avoid**  \nBright fruits, citrus\n\n**Steep**  \n3-5 days.\n\n**Recipe Idea: [Banana Cream w/ Cinnamon Crumble](https://alltheflavors.com/my/recipes/1492)**  \n*Ratio: 15PG/85VG*  \n*Steep: 5+ days* \n\n**Ingredient**|**%**|\n:--|:--|\nTFA Banana Cream|3%|\nFLV Butterscotch|1%|\nCAP Graham Cracker|2%|\nFLV Milk & Honey|1.5%|\nFLV Cinnamon Crunch|1.5%|\nHS Banana|0.75%|\nFLV Cream|0.75%|\n\n\nIn this recipe, the Milk & Honey is serving as the main component of the cream base, as well as a base for a dark sweetness to be built upon. It plays really well with the butterscotch here, and pairs really well with banana. Try mixing Milk & Honey with nuts/peanut butter and you'll probably dig the outcome too.\n\n**Edit:** Looking through some of my old notes, I think my [Milk & Honey](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/13546#milk_honey_by_cheebasteeba) really showcases this flavoring a lot more than the recipe I originally presented. If you're interested in this ingredient, I highly recommend checking out this recipe instead.","author":"CheebaSteeba","title":"Milk and Honey","url":"https://redd.it/4wppiz","vendor":{"name":"Flavorah","code":"FLV"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FLV","title":"Milk and Honey"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
