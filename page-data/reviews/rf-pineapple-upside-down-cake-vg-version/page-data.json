If anyone knows anything I should do differently feel free to let me know. I promise I won't cry ;) Maybe...lol\n\n&nbsp;\n\nPlease understand these are just my opinions, and I have only been mixing for about 8 months. I hope it helps. These flavors really do need at least a 4 week steep to fully develop the flavors. VG just doesn't carry the flavor like PG. However, even using higher percentages, if they are single flavors it's not using any more flavoring than they usual 15-20% of combines flavors that is commonly used with a lot of flavoring. These are not super concentrated like INW or FA.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Pineapple Upside Down Cake**\n\n- Tested at 10 day steep at 15%. Very sweet. In all fairness, I have found Real Flavors to get so much stronger and better with a month steep, probably because of the vg, This may end up being fantastic after a full 30 days. I will update notes when I get there.They nailed the cooked pineapple flavor aspect, but for stand alone it needs support. Has a sweet cooked pineapple with a slight background of yellow cake and hint of brown sugar. Good starting point, haven't found that cooked pineapple flavor anywhere else. I think with some help from more yellow cake, a little richness from butter, and a bit of caramel and brown sugar to provide that caramelization it will be good. It is very sweet though, so the challenge will be to add the caramel and brown sugar without more sweetness. Might add a bit of FA Fresh Cream to tone down the sweetness and help with keeping the cake moist.\n- At a 4 week steep. Ok, I didn't like this as a SF, so I started making my version using this as the main base flavor. And I can't find my tester, so I must have dumped it, so I can't give an accurate opinion after steeping. I will say it delicious in my recipe and I'm loving it :)","author":"mysticrosell","title":"Pineapple Upside Down Cake VG Version","url":"https://redd.it/4rhfu1","vendor":{"name":"Real Flavors","code":"RF"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"RF","title":"Pineapple Upside Down Cake VG Version"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
