High throat hit. Some peel, sweet, i can taste the pulp pretty clearly. Medium dryness, light acetone off notes. No floral notes.\n\n*After steep:* High throat hit. Some peel, some pulp, but all really thin. Not juicy, medium sweetness.\n\nOverall its a bad pick. I seriously don't know how to use this one, i'm really lost. Its so thin that it will vanish against other flavors. It needs so much tweaking that you better just look for other green apple all together.","author":"KillScreen-","title":"Green Apple","url":"https://redd.it/84r8io","vendor":{"name":"Flavor West","code":"FW"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FW","title":"Green Apple"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
