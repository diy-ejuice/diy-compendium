It's a clean white rice, creamy and sweet. I get what I believe is a heavy thick cream, not pudding or custard. The sweetness is not a sugar nor a sweetener flavor itself. It's very similar to a sweet cream with a little more sweetness. I almost get a hint of butter, not sure at this point if it's actually part of the flavor or texture. The mouth feel is a full bodied and textured creamy rice. I am really liking this so far, very very authentic.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:** Cream?\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit:** 2/10\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Pairings:** Cakes, cereal, creams, custards, nuts, butter, cinnamon, spices, nutmeg, horchata, pudding, brown sugar.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Notes:** This is a very good strength at 2%. This is the rice I have been looking for to complete my rice pudding, and so far is adding the rice body and creamy texture to TFA Horchata Smooth during the pudding testing. I surprisingly liked this single flavor, but it would be also be great with a dab of butter and cinnamon for a warm bowl of creamy rice cereal.\n","author":"mysticrosell","title":"Sweet Rice","url":"https://redd.it/6dku24","vendor":{"name":"Flavor Express","code":"FE"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FE","title":"Sweet Rice"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
