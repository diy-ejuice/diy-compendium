Dual: 8-10 wrap 3mmid 316LSS Temp control 400-520 degrees. Sweet spot around 500.\n\nLike biting into a fresh mango. Lightly fleshy, slightly chemically like a mango. But not in a bad way. Many manufacturers of these tropical fruits will have an extremely off chemical taste but this one is spot on the real thing after a few days steep. Not too sweet. Sweetener or marshmallow a huge plus.\n\n1% Great for cocktail mixes. Can add a nice tropical note. Light and refreshing it mixes well with other fruits in a medley. \n2% Stronger but not a full on independent flavor. Will standout more as a main flavor in tropical blends. I'd use it here if I were to use say two fruits like a mango kiwi. \n3% Awesome main flavor. Could easily all day vape by itself or with some light creams, vanilla and marshmallow. Great as the frontrunner in any rum drink or alcohol vape. Fruit mix surprise. \n4% Would probably just not be a good idea. Way too strong. Think heavy floral.\n\nMixes with:\n\nVanillas: depending on application\n\nCreams: vienna, sweet cream, bavarian, fresh cream, vanilla swirl, light custard v1 (oh yeah), marshmallows, whipped cream, buttercream, torrone, vanilla cream, yogurts. Thicker cheesy like creams could be very nice with the proper sweetener.\n\nFruits: Anything you can imagine tropical. Other mangos (fleshy ones, use this as the pop), FA kiwi, pineapple, good guava, coconut, papaya, lime, orange, lemon, citrus in general, blackberries, black currant, real cherry, banana, raspberry, watermelon, peach, oba oba.\n\nFloral: rose, ylang ylang, honeysuckle, hibiscus, cactus, lavender\n\nBakery: I don't know how far I'd go here but I can see a really smooth or light flaky thing going here. if you get creative you may be able to do something with FA cookie, INW biscuit, light sugar cookie (maybe), zeppola, cap yellow cake, nonna's cake. Perhaps a creamy sort of cookie.\n\nAll in all a solid mango. I'm going to try and keep this in my collection. I have MANY ideas on it's use and after reading this, I hope you do too.","author":"Boogenshizzle","title":"Golden Eye","url":"https://redd.it/7ukkkt","vendor":{"name":"Purilum","code":"PUR"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"PUR","title":"Golden Eye"}},
