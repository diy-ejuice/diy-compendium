    "result": {"data":{"reviewsJson":{"markdown":"**Setup:** Plume Veil RDA; dual parallel @ .35Î©; cotton wicks; 45W\n\n**Testing:** CAP Golden Pineapple @ 4%; Aged: 2 days\n\n**Flavor description:** Sweet pineapple taste with a bit of added sugar and a touch of subtle tartness.  More of a canned pineapple taste.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Slight notes of oranges, but not unpleasant.  \n\n**Throat hit:** 7/10. \n\n**Uses:**  Great for summertime mixes.  3-5% as a top note or in smaller percentages (0.5-2%) as an accent to other fruits.  A must have for a Pina Colada recipe.\n\n**Pairings:** Citrus fruits, tropical fruits, coconut, light creams or vanillas.  \n\n**Notes:**   A bit more robust than INW Pineapple, but a little less authentic.  I use it with INW to make a more rounded pineapple taste.  Ratios can vary depending on what you're after.\n\nEDIT: [Link to all of our flavor reviews in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)\n\n","author":"wh1skeyk1ng","title":"Golden Pineapple","url":"https://redd.it/4q02fk","vendor":{"name":"Capella","code":"CAP"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"CAP","title":"Golden Pineapple"}},
