Decently balanced between wet and dry, and is predominantly sweet with some subtle tartness.  \n\n**Off-flavors:**  nothing off at 3%, but may get weird if you push the percentage much higher.\n\n**Throat hit:** 5/10\n\n**Uses:**  Enjoyable as a standalone or as a top note (2-3%), blends well into the middle of a fruit mix, effective as a dark accent to another fruit(0.5-1.5%).  This could also easily be used as a substitute for grape.\n\n**Pairings:**  Creams, bakeries, most fruits, dark tobaccos.\n\n**Notes:**   While I thought the purple Trix cereal taste I get on the exhale was rather odd, I still find this flavor very enjoyable.  I do believe that if paired with the right fruits, that cereal bit may not be noticeable.  \n\n**Bonus Recipe** [Plum Smugglin](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/16608#plum_smugglin_by_philosaphucker) by /u/philosaphucker and /u/ID10-T  \n\nIngredient|%\n:---|---:\nBlackberry (TPA)|0.5\nKentucky Bourbon (TPA)|3\nPlum (INW)|0.75\nToasted Marshmallow (TPA)|2\n\n[Link to all of our flavor reviews in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)\n\nEdit: forgot a word","author":"wh1skeyk1ng","title":"Plum","url":"https://redd.it/5ggfui","vendor":{"name":"Inawera","code":"INW"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"INW","title":"Plum"}},
