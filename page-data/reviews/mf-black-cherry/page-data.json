Reminds me of plum peels. This is like a Luden's cough drop cherry but darker and not as sweet, or a black cherry Kool-aid at higher percentages.\n\n\nIt also has a cherry pectin kind of tang and bit of juiciness on the back of the tongue after the exhale. That juiciness increases with percentage and starts to become a little tiny bit harsh. \n\n\nAt 1% it's not so candyish and a bit more natural. The candy kicks in at 1.5% for me. At 2% it starts to get little mediciney with the harshness building. \n\n\n**Off flavors:** No real off flavors here, just a little bit of harshness and mediciney flavor at high percentages. \n\n\n**Throat hit:** Non existent at 1%. Mild at 2% and should grow from there. \n\n\n**Pairings:** This would be great with another more natural cherry to bring out the dark jammy notes for a bakery. This also may pair well with plum and blackcurrant in a dark fruit vape. It's a nice sweet topper to a tart lemonade as well. My next trial will be to pair it with pipe tobaccos. I imagine it will work well with creams and yogurts too. \n\n\n**Quick recipe:**\n\n1% MF Black Cherry\n\n4% LA Lemonade\n\n1% TFA Strawberry Ripe\n\n\n**Conclusion:** It's a really nice dark cherry that avoids most of the medicine flavor you normally get from cherry profiles and should be pretty versatile. Even though this concentrate is difficult to work with and takes a while to steep, it mixed well with the PG based fruit concentrates I threw at it and made a tasty vape. I'm interested how it may do with creams and bakeries as well. \n\n\n**Second opinions:** Not much on ELR, 3-4 recipes with the obvious pairings I've mentioned. No notes.\n\n\nOne review on [ECX] (http://staging.ecigexpress.com/diy-e-liquid/diy-e-liquid-flavors/lotus-flavors/black-cherry-flavor-by-lotus-flavors.html) that confirms its not as harsh as other black cherry flavors.\n\n\n\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**\n\n\nEDIT added flavor reviews wiki link.
