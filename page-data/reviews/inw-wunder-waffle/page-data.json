It was nauseating. I'm not even sure how to describe the taste I got from this flavor, but I'll do my best. There was a subtle artificial chocolate note, which I was not expecting. What hit me next was this disgusting, rotted bread, yeasty note. I've honestly never tasted anything like it in a flavor before. It was so bad I was gagging by the time I was done exhaling. Definitely unusable at that point. I don't think anything would help it, either.\n\nOne Month Later:\n\nSurprisingly, the mix is clear. I was almost sure it would have turned some shade of lovely shit brown at this point, even without the presence of nicotine, given how terrible of a flavor it tasted.\n\n\"But wait, what about its taste after a month?!\" you inquire, with wundering eyes.\nWell, refer to everything I've already said. Because that shit still applies.\nIf Shaggy wrote a song about INW Wunder Waffle, he would name it Mr. Vomtastic. I would rather vape OOO Beef, then have to taste this abomination again.\n\nSuggested Percentages: 0\n\nSuggested Pairings: the trash can","author":"EdibleMalfunction","title":"Wunder Waffle","url":"https://redd.it/bghtkn","vendor":{"name":"Inawera","code":"INW"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"INW","title":"Wunder Waffle"}},
