Not very dense would give it a 4 out of 10.      \n  \n**Flavor Properties**- Soda with the nice Ginger Snap, and lemon lime flavor.\n                 \n**Relatable Flavors** -  Without using the words ginger ale or soda. Like drinking sparkling cider or champagne after chewing on fresh ginger.\n\n**Position in the recipe** - Pretty good stand alone flavoring should make a nice top note or base, and at lower % will give you a nice fizzy accent.\n\n**Pairings** -  All citrus flavors especially Orange should work nicely. Add a little cream to make a cream soda, and for an adventure in odd flavors I'm going to try it with a little chocolate.","author":"Chrisdvr1","title":"Ginger Ale VG Version","url":"https://redd.it/4ls0k5","vendor":{"name":"Real Flavors","code":"RF"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"RF","title":"Ginger Ale VG Version"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
