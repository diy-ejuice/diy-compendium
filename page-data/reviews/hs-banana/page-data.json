Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** HS Banana 1.25% 70/30 VG/PG, Steeped 2 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Banana, something between a candy like banana and banana taste that you find in baked goods. \nInhale and the actual smell of it is similar to LA banana cream, I get that banana runts vibe. The actual top notes remind me of banana peel and the flavor is very ‘soft’ giving a realistic banana mouth feel. What this reminds me of most is a baked banana, this is very spot on, delicate bakery banana flavor.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Anything above 2% and  I start getting a sharp alcohol/perfume like notes. This flavor is pretty strong and I saw on bullcity that the reviewer said he only needed .5-.75% to give his recipe a more authentic banana flavor, I find that at 1% it shows up perfectly in the mixes I have tried. \n\n**Throat Hit:** Light. Nothing really 1/10\n\n**Uses & Pairings:** Other fruits like strawberry, apple, or anything you like with banana. The definite pairing for me here is bakery or creams. This would work with brown sugars, nuts, caramels, definitely ice creams and all your other treats. \n\n**Notes:**\nS&V definitely more candy like slightly floral but this flavor quickly ages into a creamy semi real banana. \nMy favorite thing about this flavor is that its balanced and has a creaminess on its own. Definitely reminds me of LA banana cream but if someone held freshly peeled banana nearby, it hits a lot of the right banana notes. I am not a huge fan of banana vapes but I make a lot of things for other people and I have found this Banana to work in many applications… here is one of my favorites:\n\n**Banana Nut Bread**\n\n        1 \t(HS) Banana\n\n\t1\t(LA) Banana Cream\n\n\t1\t(TPA) Brown Sugar\n\n\t3\t(TPA) Cheesecake (graham Crust)\n\n\t0.5\t(FA) Cookie\n\n\t0.45\t(FA) Hazel Grove (hazelnut)\n\n\t3\t(TPA) Pistachio\n\n\t1.5\t(CAP) Sugar Cookie\n\nhttps://alltheflavors.com/recipes/24818#banana_nut_bread_by_vdevil\n\n**Second Opinions:**\nOne review on bull city saying how [potent and realistic it is](http://www.bullcityflavors.com/banana-hs/)\n\nCouple notes on ELR about how potent and realistic it is, also mentions [perfume and banana peel notes.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/14232)\n\nNot much on this sub about it but /u/CheebaSteeba used it in a good looking recipe [here](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/recipe/603504/Butterscotch%20Banana%20Frozen%20Custard)\n\n[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)\n\nEdit: removed a word","author":"HashSlingingSlashur","title":"Banana","url":"https://redd.it/5ln2eq","vendor":{"name":"Hangsen","code":"HS"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"HS","title":"Banana"}},
