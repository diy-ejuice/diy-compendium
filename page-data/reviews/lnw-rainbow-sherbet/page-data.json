I've never had rainbow sherbet that wasn't ice cold before, so perhaps that's throwing me for a loop, but I feel like this is missing something (nothing a little koolada wouldn't fix.) The fruitiness is blended so that no flavor really jumps out to the front, just like my experience with actual sherbet. \nThere is a mild creaminess in the background that reminds me that this is an ice cream flavor, but it in no way detracts from the accuracy or balance here. This seems a tiny bit less concentrated than the other LNW flavors, but it may come out better after a longer steep. Overall I'm very impressed!\n\n**Off-flavors:** I got a weirdness in the first puff that I'm going to say was probably the fresh cotton, but I'll mention it here just in case. It vanished without a trace after a moment.\n\n**Throat Hit:** nope\n\n**Uses & Pairings:** Historically sherbet is eaten between meals as a palate cleanser, so that is one possible use. I can't imagine what else you would put with this except for toppings? This might just be standalone for me @5% or a little higher. I could see maybe peanuts or gummy candy. This will take some imagination to play with (maybe try to add some waffle cone flavor?)\n\n**Notes:** I'm still waiting for a really bad flavor from this line. Even the Pez-like pineapple and Kool-aid grape were pretty good (if that is the kind of taste you need) so far they have all impressed me. Oh, and you have no idea how dumb I feel after having to find and replace all \"Sherbert\" with \"Sherbet\"... \n\n**Second Opinions:** not yet.\n\nEdit: specificity\n","author":"PerennialPhilosopher","title":"Rainbow Sherbet","url":"https://redd.it/6a2khf","vendor":{"name":"Liquid Nicotine Wholesale","code":"LNW"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"LNW","title":"Rainbow Sherbet"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
