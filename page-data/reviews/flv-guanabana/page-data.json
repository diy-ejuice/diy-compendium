Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Guanabana @ 3%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 32 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Cherimoya or custard apple. Dense, sweet, and creamy. Overall effect is a like a tangy, overripe banana. I get some pineapple, coconut, and almost a cherry/strawberry here as well. Some tart, raw, astringent green notes to watch for but really interesting and full tropical flavor without tasting like an umbrella drink.\n\nInhale is a bit green and astringent with a soft banana flavor.  Exhale opens up with tart, thin pineapple top notes on top of a ripe bordering overripe banana. Some bright fruitiness there too, a lot like a strawberry or cherry flavor. Banana crosses into creaminess and really shows up on the back half of the exhale. Non-dairy and almost like a coconut milk. Moderately dense, exhale has a natural fruit sweetness. That pineapple note kind of leaves your mouth a bit raw.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Green peel notes, more astringent than earthy. Not super prominent, but noticeable.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Nah, but it does definitely leave your mouth feeling a bit raw.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:** Really, just mix /u/deejaymillsnyc/ 's [Batido de Guanabana.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/53xeu2/batido_de_guanabana/) Awesome use of this concentrate in a creamy milkshake base.  Goes really well with creams.  Has enough backbone to stand up in a custard as well, although that green note is something to watch with buttery or eggy notes.  This would also pair really well with a creamy coconut.\n\nFruit mixes will be tricky, in that you're likely going to be just reinforcing the flavors that already here and pushing the whole thing out of balance. /u/fuck_u_mean/ talked about that in a comment on a [FLV Soursop review:](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/5ahfyh/flv_soursop/) \" I've been having a hell of a time finding good pairing that don't just accentuate some of the flavors already present in the individual concentrates (ie pineapple, strawberry, coconut, banana, cream.)\"  The more I mess with this, the more I agree wholeheartedly.  Might help to approach this backwards and use this at a low percentage to boost either a banana a pineapple into a riper, sweeter more realistic fruit.\n\n**Notes:**\nS&V concentration testing, fairly dull and non-descript at 1% and under. Just sort of sweaty, creamy vaguely tropical taste. At 1.5% tastes quite a bit like a real banana. The green notes are doing a good job adding some dimension and depth to that soft banana flavor. Really nice at 2%. Those brighter fruit notes show up and that tartness/green flavor is still very much in the background. 3% is personally about as high as I'd go from single flavor testing. It just starts to get a bit weird and too tart. Anything higher, and you're going to need some cream to temper that green edge, /u/deejaymillsnyc/ uses this at 4%, so it's certainly possible.  I'd mix this at 1.5% as a supporting player behind other fruits, maybe 2.5 to 3% as a primary note with other fruits in the mix, and 4% if you want to go full out with creams.\n\nAlready touched on this quite a bit on the soursop review, but the flavor review list didn't have a seperate entry. This is really tasty, if a bit hard to mix with.\n\n**Second Opinions:** \n\n[Quick take from DiyOrDie, mango heavy with a lot of pine.  I don't necessarily get pine out of the green note, but I could definitely see the mango.](https://www.instagram.com/p/BMrjpjtjxMp/?hl=en)\n\n[Decent notes on ELR, lots of tropical fruit](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/108790)\n\n[/u/deejaymillsnyc/ gives a rundown in his recipe notes.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/53xeu2/batido_de_guanabana/)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Guanabana","url":"https://redd.it/5lx6gm","vendor":{"name":"Flavorah","code":"FLV"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FLV","title":"Guanabana"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
