Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** RF SC Brown Sugar @ 2% and 4%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 18 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Right off the bat, some people are using this stuff, and I'll cover that in the second opinions.\n\nI'm pretty sure this isn't safe to vape. It's another one of the sticky concentrates, a lot like [RF SC Cherry Cola Type](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/6fnetd/rf_sc_cherry_cola_type/)  but not quite as dark. It's not a scientific test by any means, but I set up some coffee filters and put a drop of this and FA Cocoa on there to see if they asorb.  The FA Cocoa absorbed, stained the hell out of the filter, but it absorbed within 30 seconds. It's been five minutes and I'm still looking at a puddle of gelatinous *something* sitting on top of the filter from the RF Brown Sugar.  I'm getting burnt notes off of this on the first drag at 2 and 4%. Even at .25%, I'm getting like 2 drags max before it tastes markedly burnt. Dry burning the coil afterwards, there is something heavily gunking them up.\n\nWith all that said, it definitely tastes like brown sugar before it tastes like burning. It's pretty intensely dry though, even at .25%.  Like a bitter chemical back end and then you run straight into something burning.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Really dry, chemical bitterness, and then burning whatever the hell. \n \n**Throat Hit:**  Harsh right off the rip, worse when it's burning.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:** Coffee creamer? Baking?\n\n**Notes:**  I can't find a point at which this doesn't burn. Using .25% at 300F, I'm still getting some burning.  I've rewicked 8 times total, and i don't feel like there is an intersection of where this works but doesn't burn in normal concentrations at normal vaping temperatures.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nSo like I said, some people are using this.\n\n[On ELR, this has a 3.5 star average, but a whole bunch of 4 and 5 stars balanced by some ones.  User \"Pro_Vapes\" says: \"Simply put, this is the most realistic Brown Sugar I've tried. Very smooth with a Caramel-esque mouthfeel. It's not overly sweet and plays well with other flavors. Excellent with Cakes, Pies, Fruit, Tobacco and any mix where you'd like a dark flavored sweetener. Usage: .5-1% as a mixer... 1-1.5% as a topnote.\"  There is also a note by user \"Kotsos\" that it's : \"Too concentrated (it's also very very dark) and a bit weird above 0.75%, it has a dark sweetness but it's so heavy that it goes the savory route. It has a chemical molasses taste that makes it very unpleasant after some puffs. Stick with TFA.\" So it's not just me that's getting some kind of burning off this.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/114099)\n\n[Here's the product page from Real Flavors.  Their take: \"Did you know that molasses is responsible for the color and strong scent of brown sugar? It is! It’s also responsible for the moistness of brown sugar, as compared to white. A delicious ingredient used in all manner of baked goods, desserts, drinks and even some savory dishes…this flavor is just what you need for something exciting and new in your blends.\"](http://www.realflavors.com/shop/brown-sugar-super-concentrate/)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**\n\nH/T to /u/runcibles/ for the suggestion.","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Brown Sugar SC","url":"https://redd.it/6h8oep","vendor":{"name":"Real Flavors","code":"RF"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"RF","title":"Brown Sugar SC"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
