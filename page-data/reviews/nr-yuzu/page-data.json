Bearing in mind that I am new at this, feedback is welcome.\n\n**NR Yuzu**\n\nTesting setup: Voopoo Conjure with the kanthal clapton coil that came with it at 35W, minimal cotton.\n\nSamples were prepared by counting drops of concentrate added to 10ml of 50/50 6mg base, assuming 1 drop to be 1/20th ml.\n\nNotes below are from unsteepted testing, will retest and add steeped notes in about a week.\n\n1.5% Floral sweetness, vaguely citrusy. Yummy.\n\n2% Sweet and juicy, flavor still subtle, vaguely citrusy.\n\n2.5% Fruit coming through now, reminiscent of grapefruit without the bitterness. The juicy sweetness has faded into the background.\n\n3% Full-on citrus juice, again like grapefruit without the bitterness or astringency.\n\n3.5% At this level, the flavor no longer quite comes together. The pleasant juicy quality has mutated into something worse. Tastes artificial, like some kind of citrus drink powder.\n\nVerdict: Not too exciting as a single flavor. Should work well at around 2% for adding juiciness to any citrus flavor.","author":"mkweise","title":"Yuzu","url":"https://redd.it/eckxhg","vendor":{"name":"NicRiver","code":"NR"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"NR","title":"Yuzu"}},
