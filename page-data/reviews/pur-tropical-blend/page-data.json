Refreshing, juicy, creamy, complex and very well balanced. Fresh coconut, pineapple, guava, and maybe a hint of watermelon? I'm not sure of all the flavors yet, but none overwhelms each other. It's very smooth, no acidity or harshness that is common with pineapple. Tastes like I'm laying on a hot beach with one of those frosty fruit cocktails served in a pineapple with a cute umbrella. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:** None\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit:** 2/10\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Pairings:** Anything you would normally mix with fruits. Berries, banana, punch, rum, sweet cream, fresh cream, Koolada, mints, menthol.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Notes:** Easily a good SF blend. Good strength at 7-9% range and 1.5-5% in blends. I can't think of another flavor I have tried that is similar to this for comparison. Would I buy this? In a heartbeat. I can see this being my summertime ADV with and without Koolada.\n","author":"mysticrosell","title":"Tropical Blend","url":"https://redd.it/5mxa06","vendor":{"name":"Purilum","code":"PUR"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"PUR","title":"Tropical Blend"}},
