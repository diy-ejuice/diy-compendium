Before a steep, I swore I tasted real metallic gold.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Nothing really off unless you count the metallic gold you get before a short steep.  However it is \"gold\" for pipe, right?\n\n**Throat hit:** 3/10 pretty smooth with a heavy feel\n\n**Uses:** Good as is, but would work in a blended tobacco base too.  \n\n**Pairings:**   other preferred tobaccos.  Could be complimented by small amounts of nuts, caramel, vanilla, possibly some of the more buttery custards, or even some light floral flavorings.\n\n**Notes:**   I don't like the idea of trying to doctor this flavor too much, simply because of its delicate complexity.  I think this flavor works fine as a shake n vape, however it does change a bit over time leaving little to be desired as far as flavor either way IMO.\n\n**Bonus Recipe**\n\nIngredient | Percentage\n---|---\nINW Gold for Pipe | 3-4%\n\n[Link to all of our flavor reviews in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)","author":"wh1skeyk1ng","title":"Gold for Pipe","url":"https://redd.it/5k47x3","vendor":{"name":"Inawera","code":"INW"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"INW","title":"Gold for Pipe"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
