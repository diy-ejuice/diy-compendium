This new offering delivers a fluffy, smooth taste with a crisp crunch.\n\n**Flavor description**: First off the pull you get a sweet baked flavor. I don't know if I would call it a biscuit, because I'm not British and haven't had one, but it tastes more of a baked cookie without the chocolate and has sugar sprinkled on top. Much like FA's Meringue sweet sugar flavor. The baked flavor is really pleasant. Not as dry as INW Biscuit and not as buttery as JF's version. Tastes of a perfectly baked cookie flavor with some light sugar sprinkled on top. It's not as dry or flakey as FA Cookie but it does have some elements of a flakey flavor. The baked flavor a little more prominent after the initial mix but it hasn't faded too much; just a little noticeable. Overall a really good flavor.\n\n**Throat hit**: Nothing of note/ incredibly smooth\n\n**Off-flavors**: Nada\n\n**Uses**: 2-4%. The options are wide open for this one. The only thing to consider is the sugar finish with the flavor. I think this would work well with other applications of the various biscuits out there. Along with a cereal type flavor. Paired with Cap Cereal 27 would add the sugary coating taste to the cereal.\n\n**Second Opinions**:\n\nOnly found one thing on it.\n\n[Biscuit gives that delightful cookie flavor. I’d say it’s a cross between a shortbread and a digestive biscuit. Has a light coconut taste to it.](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/65420#butter_pecan_biscuit_by_sheilag) \n\n","author":"chewymidget","title":"Biscuit SL","url":"https://redd.it/74k1o1","vendor":{"name":"Capella","code":"CAP"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"CAP","title":"Biscuit SL"}},
