    "result": {"data":{"reviewsJson":{"markdown":"**Setup:** Velocity 2 Clone, Dual 15 wrap 3mm Nifethal 70 coils @.18 ohms.  45W power, 480F temp limit. Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Basil @ 3%. Steeped for a week.\n\n**Flavor Description** Somewhere between fresh basil and fresh fennel.  Fairly sweet, but it has some almost anise bite.  Hint of vanilla somewhere in there.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  At 45w tastes a lot like fennel.  Upping the power starts to push into a a swampy vegetal taste underneath a clear, bright basil flavor.\n\n**Throat Hit**6/10.  Fairly harsh on an RDA especially at lower wattages.  Loses a lot of that throat hit in a tank.\n\n**Uses:**Refreshing alternative or complement for a natural mint flavor. Beverage mixes.  Savory flavors, if you are a monster.  At lower percentages I could see it complementing a sweet anise flavor.\n\n**Pairings:**Pineapple, Strawberry, Anise, Mint, Vanilla.  Brighter fruit mixes without a jammy component.\n\n**Notes:**Picked this up because I was curious about the August 8th stuff that Flavorah dropped and hadn't seen a lot of reviews.  Primary competition here would be FA Zen Garden, and I think this wins hands down.  Zen Garden has always tasted like dried basil flakes, whereas this is a much brighter and fresh tasting flavor.  It does struggle with some of the same off flavors at higher wattages.  I was hoping for a nice clean thai basil type of flavor, and it falls short of that mark.  Much more of a sweet basil flavor with some vegetal murkiness.  A mix with any kind of jammy or fermented flavor is going to do some really weird things to this concentrate.","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Basil","url":"https://redd.it/59mknq","vendor":{"name":"Flavorah","code":"FLV"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FLV","title":"Basil"}},
