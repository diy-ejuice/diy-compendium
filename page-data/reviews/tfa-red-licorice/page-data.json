It is spot on Red Vines. Right off the mix it is absolute perfection. It fills your whole palette, so I don't think this is something that you can really mix with other flavors. It is mainly if you really just want some red licorice you can mix this up and you will have a perfect experience.  \n* **Off-flavors:** None\n* **Throat Hit:** 0/10\n* **Uses & Pairings:**I think this is going to be the best for new mixers to put in their first favor order if they like red licorice. Or any seasoned mixer who just wants a simple thing to mix up on the way out the door for work or while waiting for other things to steep. I don't think this will mix well with anything else because it is just so heavy and full flavor. I think if you wanted to mix it with something you could mix it with cream?\n* **Notes:**\nNothing that I haven't said. This flavor is pretty straight forward. \n\n*If you have anything else to add feel free to add in the comments.
