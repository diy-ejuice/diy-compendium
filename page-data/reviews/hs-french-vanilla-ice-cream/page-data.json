I would rate its density at about 5 out of 10. Slight throat hit 4 out of 10.                         \n    \n**Flavor Properties**- Nice smooth vanilla not extremely prevalent, but still noticeable in combination with a buttery and sweet cream base.\n\n**Relatable Flavors** - Remind me of adding a small amount of vanilla to buttermilk.\n\n**Off Flavors** - The slightly musky note to the vanilla.                       \n               \n**Position In The Recipe** - Given its light density I believe this would work well in a base, or as an accent for other creams doesn't quite have the punch to be a top note.\n\n**Pairings** - The musk note of the vanilla makes me think of tobacco first. I believe it would also pair well with creams,  berries, chocolates, and most bakeries.\n\n*Please if your opinion differs, or you have another review for this post it in the comments, this will help the master list with multiple reviews in one spot.*\n           ","author":"Chrisdvr1","title":"French Vanilla Ice Cream","url":"https://redd.it/4oknbm","vendor":{"name":"Hangsen","code":"HS"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"HS","title":"French Vanilla Ice Cream"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
