I don't remember why, but I didn't like it at all, so I put it back in the steep drawer. At 2 months, it's very good, but way too rich for an ADV for my tastes. Graham cracker crust is very very dominant at this higher percentage, too much so, with a rich french vanilla cream drizzled with caramel? It's a nice moderately sweet blend, but the graham is very, very front and center. I am probably going to boost the cream in this. Wonderful thick buttery mouth feel. I like this a lot with the longer steep, and I think it's really needed due to the complexity of this flavor. I can already see this doing fantastic things in blends in the 1.5-5% range. Going to dilute the rest of this tester down to roughly equivalent to 10% and see what happens with it :) It's basically a rich french vanilla mousse pie with graham cracker crust and a touch of caramel. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:** None really, but needs a long steep for the graham cracker to settle down.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit:** 2/10\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Pairings:** Really good stand alone flavor. Berries and fleshy fruits. Bakeries, cookies, cakes, creams, custards, nuts, tobaccos, apple pie, cinnamon rolls/cinnamon maybe?\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Notes:** I think 10% is plenty for a SF, and I will probably use 1.5-5% in blends.
