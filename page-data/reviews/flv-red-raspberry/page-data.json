    "result": {"data":{"reviewsJson":{"markdown":"**Setup:** Velocity 2 Clone, Dual 15 wrap 3mm Nifethal 70 coils @.18 ohms.  45W power, 480F temp limit. Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Red Raspberry @ 3%. Steeped for 8 days.\n\n**Flavor Description** Dark, dry, and sort of flat raspberry.  Tastes a little thin @ 3%.  If I had to liken it to another concentrate it would be FA Bilberry.  Not as good, but does the same sort of dark skin thing that Bilberry does with blueberries.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  It can get a bit medicinal.  Almost a robotussin vibe if vaped solo.\n\n**Throat Hit** 8/10.  Mysteriously harsh for a raspberry.  I'm getting the same kind of harshness from a tank, although less pronounced.\n\n**Uses:** Lower percentage to give a bright raspberry more depth. Higher percentage for the base of a jammy raspberry or mixed berry pie.\n\n**Pairings:** Complement to brighter berries like INW Raspberry, FA Raspberry, or even TFA Sweet Raspberry.  Liquid Amber to up \"cooked\" flavor.  Anything you'd mix up berries with, man.  Chocolates would work well with the dryer raspberry flavor.\n\n**Notes:** Definitely not a single flavor or even a great raspberry by itself.  I think it has moderate potential and I'll be working with like I use FA Bilbery.  FLV Boysenberry is the single greatest threat to this flavors relevance.  I can get sweet, dark, jammy notes from boysenberry with less weird drawbacks.  Maybe useful to avoid oversweetening a juice.","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Red Raspberry","url":"https://redd.it/59qx6w","vendor":{"name":"Flavorah","code":"FLV"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FLV","title":"Red Raspberry"}},
