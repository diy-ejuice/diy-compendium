A truly unique and remarkable flavor that has numerous uses!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Manufacturers Suggested Usage:** 5-10%\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Aroma:** Artificial raspberry. Sweetness.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Flavor Description:** Sweet artificial raspberry candy. It has that hard candy flavor to it. Raspberry is the dominant flavor, but I'm also getting hints of blue raspberry every once in a while. This one also seems a bit dry, almost powdery? Maybe it's from a sour additive? I'm not getting any sour flavor nor sensation. The raspberry seems muted and flat. It's missing the juiciness that I usually associate with a hard candy, as well as that slight pucker tang usually found in the sour varieties.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:** Hints of blue raspberry.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit:** 2/10\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Uses:** Candy. Additive to make raspberry coke, ginger ale, , lemon lime, cream soda, or raspberry soda. Anywhere you are looking for a sweet artificial raspberry flavor.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Notes:** The dryness and muting made this a somewhat unpleasant vape for my personal tastes. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Other Opinions:** From louiesquared on ELR: It’s tart but I wouldn’t say that it’s sour. It has a nice Raspberry Candy flavor. Kind of dry like maybe a Pixie Stix or Fun Dip candy. There’s a little bit of a chemical aftertaste but it’s not too bad. I’ll retest in another week or two and see if it has steeped off.","author":"mysticrosell","title":"Sour Raspberry Candy","url":"https://redd.it/75f76h","vendor":{"name":"Purilum","code":"PUR"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"PUR","title":"Sour Raspberry Candy"}},
