Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** CAP SilverLine Cinnamon and Sugar, 2 and 5%, others noted, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 8 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  A softer butter pecan that does the candied thing fairly well but shortsells the actual pecan.\n\nThe pecan here is soft.  I don't get a lot of really intense nutty notes here, and what is here tastes a bit raw and almost chalky. The nuttiness is pretty subtle, and mostly on the tail end of the exhale.  I'm missing a lot of a toasted or even really cooked edge to those pecans.  Doesn't have a real AP Crunch to it.\n\nThere's a lighter butter note in here. Doesn't quite seem rich enough for a butter pecan, but it's a nice accent to everything else going on.  The caramel here is on the light side, and not particularly caramelized.  It has a fairly pleasant stickiness to it, but it's missing some vibrancy.  I also get some brighter vanilla, especially at higher percentage.  Almost picks up a meringue kind of edge with that slightly sticky dry sweetness and lighter caramelization.  Also seems to have a bit of cocoa on the backend.\n\nTexture here is a bit on the dry side when the flavor is fairly saturated.  At lower percentages the exhale is a bit thin and watery. I do get some of that caramel stickiness but it doesn't really have a thick or rich mouthfeel.\n\nThe only butter pecan flavor I have for comparison is FW Butter Pecan, and it's a pretty strong argument that the SilverLine version is fairly inessential.  The FW version feels noticeably richer, deeper, and nuttier than the SilverLine.  The FW is a darker flavor overall, definitely tastes a little more caramelized.  The Silverline version maybe has a bit more vanilla to it, but is lacking in butter compared to the FW.  And the FW is a bit more concentrated.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Pecan here tastes raw and picks up a bit of green at higher percentages.  Subtle cocoa in mid-ranges.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light.  There's a dryness here that gets a bit rough.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 2% I'm getting a decent butter pecan flavor on the inhale with a medium caramel and just a bit of richness.  Completely dies off on the exhale though. Kind of watery and lightly sour without any real heavy nuttiness.  Maybe a bit of a raw pecan kind of taste, but it's pretty bland overall.\n\nAt 5%, definitely more so than the 2 or 8%, I pick up some cocoa on the backend of it.  Not sure why it's only really showing up in the middle of the range, but it's fairly comparable to the cocoa on the tail of a dulce de leche kind of flavor.  Medium caramel here, but not a lot of buttery richness.  Exhale has filled in a bit and lost that watery lightly sour thing, but I'm still not getting a solid nuttiness here.\n\nAt 8% i do get more pecan out of this, but it still tastes a bit on the raw side.  It doesn't have a strong cooked flavor, and it's really low on that nutty AP crunch.  The caramel and butter note here is pretty decent, but I'm just not getting enough pecan to carry it all.  Also picking up a tiny hint of that gasoline green nut note here.\n\nJust based on these tests, I'd probably use this at around 4% as an accent and 6-7% as a primary flavor.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  If you haven't picked this up, just based on these really quick tests, I'd probably just say skip it and pick up FW Butter Pecan.  I'm not sure there are any specific applications that would really benefit from a less nutty butter pecan.\n\nI could see using this if you wanted a softer caramel flavor instead of the darker FW, and for some reason didn't have another caramel lying around.\n\nIn general, you're looking at the usual butter pecan suspects, primarily creams, bakeries, and tobaccos.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  Still fairly new.\n\n[Shoutout to ceedee99uk for linking reviews from PeegoreVapes in another thread.](https://peegorevapes.wordpress.com/2017/10/04/capella-silver-line-affordable-flavours/)\n\n[Here's the product page from Capella.](http://www.capellaflavors.com/products/butter-pecan.html)  Their description: \"You have had the ice cream and the cake, now try Silverlineâ€™s secret recipe of rich butter and nutty pecans!
