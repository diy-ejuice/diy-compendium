Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** CAP Sweet Guava @ 4%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 12 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Immediately sweet inhale with some slightly astringent, grassy perfume notes that build with heat. Dense, sticky exhale.  Deep juicy canned guava nectar flavor carries through from inhale to beginning of exhale.  Round, full sweetness.  Sticky mouthfeel lingers along those perfume notes.\n\nA nondescript sweet tropical flavor.  Light grassy almost mango peel from the top notes. Tastes like just the difference between a tart white grapefruit and sweet ruby-red grapefruit mixed with an overripe and bland banana if that makes sense.\n\n**Off-flavors:** It depends on how you want to use the concentrate.  If you want a realistic guava, way too sweet. It you want a guava nectar, those grassy top notes may get in the way, especially in combination with fruits that have a strong peel flavor.\n\n**Throat Hit:** 2/10.  Just a hint of harshness from those top notes.\n\n**Uses:**  Works as an emulsifier for disparate fruits. Base for creamy tropical fruit flavors. \n  \n**Pairings:** Bright but not floral fruits, Strawberries, Raspberries, Pineapple, Mango, Passionfruit. Sweeter citrus. Grapefruit. Hops for a bitter counter-point. Non-sweet creams.  Probably too sweet and heavy for prominent use in ice cream or rich custards.  I'd avoid nuts, bakeries, and tobacco.  Too sweet for chocolates.\n\n**Notes:**  At low percentages (1-2%) this should mix with just about anything.  At higher percentages it really does blend extremly well with any non-harsh fruits you throw at it while bring a very prominent wet sweetness.  S&V test up to 8% and it's still pleasant. Above that, top notes get pretty weird.  Juicyness is pretty linear up to 6%.\n\nPersonally, this is a winner for me. Sweet, thick, and agreeable although it can easily get cloying.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Goldbones or /u/goldfish18 uses it in his \"Guavaberry.\" Talks abouts an almost bubble gum flavor.](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/4896#guavaberry_by_goldbones)\n\n[/u/philosaphucker/ has a lean recipe that uses it for the thick sweetness.](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/14992#juicy_j_s_sizzurp_by_philosaphucker)\n\n[2,143 recipes using this on ELR. Very little useful information. Some talk about Guava Nectar taste.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/5140)\n\nNot a whole lot to go on here.  Reddit search brings up a lot of non-descript \"sweet\" and \"good,\" although I have to give /u/Botboy141/ credit for getting \"grassy\" lodged in my head.  Looks like a very popular, and poorly documented flavor.  Major agreement that it's sweeter than actual guava. And that FA Guava is a weird peel-centric nightmare.  The bubble-gum mention in /u/goldfish18/ 's juice description is interesting.  I have a juice that uses it at 5% and once someone pointed it out, that's all I can taste.  I think it's safe to say the consensus is that it's sweet, non-realistic, thick, and mixes well.  Those qualities really do convey a guava nectar.\n\nBonus:\n\n[10/10 rating and vintage use of McCormicks!](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/21ufod/capellas_guava_is_totally_amazing/)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Sweet Guava","url":"https://redd.it/5dsxqk","vendor":{"name":"Capella","code":"CAP"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"CAP","title":"Sweet Guava"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
