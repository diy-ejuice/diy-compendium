I've never had a praline, but all of the things I would think to describe it (candied pecans, creamy, sweet, almost caramel-y), seem to describe the American Praline. It's got some nice body and sweetness to it. It doesn't seem to have any of the crunch or texture I would expect from a praline or pecan flavoring though, so it will benefit greatly from other nuts, cookies, AP. It's a pretty forward flavoring, so it's probably going to take the front seat in most mixes it's in; mixed low enough (<=0.5%), I could see it making a nice accent though. Overall I really enjoy this flavoring and it seems to be fairly easy to mix with.\n\n**On the Nose**  \nNutty, a dark sweetness but not sweet (if that makes sense)  \n\n**Recommended Usage**  \n*Stand alone*: 3%\n\n*In a mix*: 1-2.5%\n\n**Throat**  \nNone; mild.\n\n**Pairings**  \nNuts, cookies, caramel, butterscotch, coffee, tobacco, creams, custards\n\n**Avoid**  \nCitrus, melon\n\n**Steep**  \nPretty good straight away, but I'd say it needs 2 days to fully mature\n\n**Quick Recipe: Pecan Pie Filling**  \n*Ratio: 10PG/90VG*  \n*Recommended Steep: 3 days (pretty damn good straight away though)* \n\n* FLV Pralines @ 2.25%\n* FLV Macaroon @ 1.25%\n* FLV Vanilla Custard @ 1.5%\n* FLV Caramel @ 1% \n\nThis recipe definitely lifts the Pralines on high and lets them shine. Since it's light on texture, the Macaroon helps bring out some of the nuttiness from the Praline as well as serving as a bit of a crust aspect to the recipe. \n\nFLV Vanilla Custard & FLV Caramel act as the thick sweet base that the pecans rest on, but I chose these because they work so well with the Pralines. FLV Vanilla Custard accents the creaminess of the Pralines very well here, and isn't too dense or vanilla forward like CAP's offering. FLV Caramel offers a really great sweet accent to the mix. You don't want a creamy caramel like TFA Caramel Original, or it will get too creamy on you and take away from the texture of the pecans. You might be able to get away with subbing FA Caramel, but I really like the way FLV's Caramel plays with the rest of the ingredients.","author":"CheebaSteeba","title":"Pralines","url":"https://redd.it/4qedfa","vendor":{"name":"Flavorah","code":"FLV"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FLV","title":"Pralines"}},
