Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Vape Train Macadamia Nut, 1%, 4% and 8%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 43 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Lightly nutty and creamy macadamia nut, with some cocoa and a little bit of playdough funkiness.\n\nThe nuttiness here is pretty mild. Doesn’t feel nearly as aggressive as some other nut flavors.  Maybe a bit nuttier than FA Almond but not quite as nutty as FW Hazelnut, just as a comparison.  Not the boldest flavor in general, but macadamia nuts aren’t a particularly aggressive nut, so that mostly checks out.  Not raw or green, but a relatively light roast to this.  Not a lot of of the warmer, crisper flavors you get from a harder roasted nut flavor.  Nuttiness feels a bit indistinct, I don’t think I’d be able to call out a macadamia nut if it wasn’t on the bottle.\n\nFeels a bit creamier than straight macadamia nuts.  Again, bringing up FA Almond, that same kind of creamier base. A bit sweetened, but nothing overbearing.  I’m picking up some occasional glazed donut type playdough flavor out of this, but it doesn’t seem out of control after this kind of steep.  Smells a bit more aggressive in the bottle, but settles down fairly well.  I notice mostly after I’m coming back to this flavor after taking a break.  I’m also getting a bit of a cocoa note here.  More subtle than the chocolate off-note in VT Devon Cream.  Not really unpleasant or clashing with the profile, but it’s going to be a lot easier to just go with it than try to mix around it.\n\n**Off-Flavors:**  A bit of that playdough-ish glazed donut flavor.  Some cocoa notes.  The actual nut here seems a bit lost in the creaminess.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Nah, feels pretty smooth overall.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 1%, this is pretty thin.  Really light nuttiness, some cocoa, and maybe some  kind of tartness.\n\nAt 4%, this feels quite a bit more solid. Relatively creamy overall, but light on the nuttiness. Cocoa is a bit more noticeable, and I get that really light playdough note.\n\nAt 8% that playdough kind of note isn’t overwhelming, but it’s definitely more present.  Still pretty smooth and creamy, more chocolate than nutty.\n\nVape Train suggests mixing with this at 1-5% or standalone from 5-9%.  Just based on these tests, that seems a bit high.  Feels like I’m getting about all I’m going to get out of this by 4%.  I’d probably start with this around 3% as an accent.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I’d basically use this as a cocoa-tinged version of FA Almond.  More used for thickness and creaminess, than the actual nutty notes.\n\nShould work fairly well in bakeries that have a chocolate component.  That cocoa note does show up in mixes, so I wouldn’t really fight it.\n\nWould also work well in a custard that can handle a bit of cocoa.\n\nI’ve been saying this a lot lately, but this could be really interesting in a tobacco.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  [Here’s the ELR page.  User “dameer.dj” writes: “Creamy. Creamy a lot! Tastes like some strange mix between honey and coconut in a good way (nature makes wonders tho). No nutty or earthy off-notes to it. Tasty and rich. I'd pair it with bakeries rather than other nuts or fruits. Slight vanilla in there, a little bit of pudding base too.”  Via google translate, user “PiriPiri” writes: “Mmm .... Macadamia Nut done right. Creamy, sweet, greasy and authentic. Flavor West's version was a flavor I had to throw, but this one is amazing. Mix with chocolate, baking, tobacco or coffee. However, it is quite weak even at 5%, I would probably stay there also in prescriptions.”  That’s a spicy take.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/234132)\n\n[No description, but here is the product page from Vape Train.](https://www.vapetrain.com.au/shop/vt-concentrates/macadamia-nut-flavour-concentrate-diy-for-e-liquid-recipe/)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Macadamia Nut","url":"https://redd.it/89cjtj","vendor":{"name":"Vape Train Australia","code":"VTA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"VTA","title":"Macadamia Nut"}},
