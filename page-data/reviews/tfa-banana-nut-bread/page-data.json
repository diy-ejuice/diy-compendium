    "result": {"data":{"reviewsJson":{"markdown":"**Disclaimer:** I'm still new into vaping/DIY/public flavour reviews but I have studied a lot of them and have done 10+ (private) single flavour testings on my own.\n\n**Setup:** 1) Wotofo Profile RDA with mesh and wotofo cotton at 50W 2) Vaporesso Guardian with 0.5Î© SS ceramic coil, TCR (35W limit, 240 C)\n\n**Testing:** 7%, 50/50 VG/PG, 3mg nic, steeped 7 days.\n\n**Flavour description:** A soft bakery with the classic fake banana taste that you have used in banana frostings or the taste of a super ripe/sweet banana (yeah, almost of black colour). The bakery part comes mostly out during the exhale, during the inhale it is mostly banana. Hidden between the bakery and the banana are some nuts, some sugar and a slight alcohol accent. On the sweet side (7/10) and with enough moisture (7/10).\n\n**Off-flavors:** The initial impression of the flavour is melon/cantaloupe but if you really put in your mind the idea of a banana nut bread then you focus back. Still, in my opinion it is there.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Pretty low at this percentage (3/10).\n\n**Uses:** I have a hard time not imagining this being the main ingredient of a recipe with \"enchantments\" - it has a pretty wide flavour palette. Alternatively it could a banana enhancer in a recipe with other more fruit centric bananas.\n\n**Pairings:** More nuts, more alcohol (rum, whiskey), more bakery (cookies, crusts, etc), other buttery flavours and sugar. It would be probably also interesting to try to pair with tobaccos.\n\n**Notes:** It is probably soft at 6% for a totally stand-alone flavour.\n\n**Rating:** 4/5. Could be 3+ and could be 5- because on one hand I find it interesting and flavourful but on the other hand (and due to the lack of experience from my side) I find it hard to imagine how I would use it as a raw ingredient in a recipe that I would create.","author":"demisone","title":"Banana Nut Bread","url":"https://redd.it/ale925","vendor":{"name":"The Flavor Apprentice","code":"TFA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"TFA","title":"Banana Nut Bread"}},
