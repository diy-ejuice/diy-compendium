Pulse BF 22 with single spaced SS316L fused clapton @ .22ohm & 75W. Fresh cotton wicks on both. Steeped 17 days.\n\n**My Take:** \n\n - If you've been on the hunt for a good cinnamon red hot flavor, look no further! The flavor is right in your face and warm throughout. It even leaves a little sting on your tongue just like when you eat the candy! The flavor is one of the most linear I've ever tasted. At 8, 10, and 12%, the flavor itself didn't change, it just got more intense as I went up without ever getting weird or chemically on me. It's definitely standalone worthy anywhere from 10 to 15%. Throat hit is minimal. What it lacks in throat hit it makes up for in pure, unadulterated heat. But you're not buying this flavor expecting a cool vape are you?! \n\n**Place in the recipe:**\n\n - It's a top note through and through. It *could* be used to add a kick to other recipes, but it's going to have to be a cinnamon or cream-based recipe because that candied cinnamon shows up even at 2%. \n\n**Sample recipes:**\n\n- Red Hot Gummy Bear \n - 12% RF Red Hot Cinnamon (VG)\n - .75% CAP Jelly Candy\n \n- Big Red Gum\n - 8% RF Red Hot Cinnamon (VG)\n - 1% LA Bubble Gum\n - .25% INW Cactus\n\n**Be aware:**\n\n- This flavor stains coils. Not in the way TFA Honeydew does, but it leaves its mark wherever you put it, so if you plan to use this flavoring a lot, you should dedicate an atomizer to it or be prepared to clean your coils before you rewick. I'm guessing you'll be fine if you're dryburning KA1 or N80, but I don't dryburn SS the same way I dryburn the other 2 materials. I had to take a little soap, water, and a wire brush to my coils after testing.","author":"RamboUnchained","title":"Red Hot Cinnamon VG Version","url":"https://redd.it/72sdu4","vendor":{"name":"Real Flavors","code":"RF"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"RF","title":"Red Hot Cinnamon VG Version"}},
