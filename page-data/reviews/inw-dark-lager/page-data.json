It can be vaped at shake and vape without any problems.\n\nFlavor: \n\nThe concentrate itself smells like a really, REALLY concentrated dark beer. I can't really tell you if it's a stout or a porter or in fact a dark lager. There are notes of coffee, burned malt, and hop. Overall it smells like beer that has been boiled down. :)\n\n**The inhale.**\n\nAt the inhale, there is a throat hit but a little bit different that I knew before. It hits me at the back of my tounge, dunno why. It's not too much though. \nThe taste when inhaling reminds me of the taste that is left on the tounge when swallowing beer. You know what I'm talking about? That pleasant mix of a delicate sourness, hop, and something kinda malty.\nOh yeah. After a few hits I can definetly taste the hop in there.\n\n**The exhale.**\n\nThroat hit at the exhale is heavier than when inhaling.\nThe taste is composed of something a little bit sweet, but also, which is interesting, a slight bitterness, and a lot of malt. It could use some more hop, though. \nThe first thing that I taste is definetly the malt and bitter notes. You know those malt non-alcoholic drinks? Well this is somewhat similar. I can taste some grain coffe notes, too.\nI can say that it really tastes and smell like beer, and if I had to compare it to any beers I know of, it would be a Guinness. It's quite light, not overwhelming.\n\n**Uses and pairings**: I think I would pair it with anything, really. Vanilla, raspberry, would be my go-to choices. When I first tried it, I had some leftover lemon juice in my tank and it mixed well, lemme tell you.\n\n**Personal testing notes**: 2% is good, but for me you can go higher for a more defined and \"beery\" experience.\n\n**Second opinions**: One of my friends said \"this is freaking great\". I must admit, if you spill it somewhere, your room will smell like a week of drinking.\n\n**Summary:** For me it's great, but it will not be my go-to juice because not everybody fancy the beer smell that it leaves.\n\nQuestion, anyone tried the INW Little Red Cap concentrate? I have a few concerns about the smell when it touches anything outside the tank...\n\nquestions/co-op/review propositions: mrgvape@gmail.com","author":"mrgruszka","title":"Dark Lager","url":"https://redd.it/7tc2on","vendor":{"name":"Inawera","code":"INW"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"INW","title":"Dark Lager"}},
