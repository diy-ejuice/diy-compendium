Vaped at .5 on a Crown or Subtank Nano @30w is delicious. On a TFV4 .35 Clapton coil at 45w all I can taste is wire and hint of burning.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**PG/VG** 30/70\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Steep Time:** 2 Weeks\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis has a mild but sweet flavor. Great to give a break from strong, heavy, and rich flavors, and I like it SF at 5-7%. I can taste slight vanilla, and some type of sweetness, slightly creamy, but a bright flavor. Maybe even a back note of cookie, but a very very light cookie, no heaviness? No specific fruit flavor, but a light and pleasant vape. Can't quite figure this out. I think would work very well to sweeten and brighten fruit flavors, maybe even lighter bakery flavors?\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Steep Time:** 2 Months Later\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis has ended up being a great accent to fruits, adds a boost of brightening with a slight vanilla back note. Mostly melons and fleshy fruits. Also good with sweet citrus flavors like orange and tangerine. Avoid lime, grapefruit, tart citrus flavors.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Recipe**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**OMG Vanilla Coconut Melon**\n\nIngredient|%\n:---|---:\nCoconut (FA)|1.5\nMarshmallow (FA)|0.75\nOba Oba (FA)|2\nSweet Coconut (Flavorah)|1.5\nVanilla Shisha (INAWERA)|1.5\nVanilla Whipped Cream (CAP)|2\nWild Melon (Flavorah)|1.5\n\nFlavor total: 10.75%\n\n","author":"mysticrosell","title":"Oba Oba","url":"https://redd.it/55smir","vendor":{"name":"Flavour Art","code":"FA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FA","title":"Oba Oba"}},
