    "result": {"data":{"reviewsJson":{"markdown":"**Setup:** Recoil w/ flavor barrel, Dual 15 wrap 26g 3mm Nifethal 70 coils @.15 ohms.  60w power, 450F temp limit. Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Ginger @ 1% and 1 drop per 10ml, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 10 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Fancy ginger ale syrup. Some spicier ginger top notes, but a thick, sweet, slightly syrupy base.  Close to something like [Reed's Extra Ginger](http://reedsinc.com/product/reeds-extra-ginger-brew/) which has a good amount of sweetness, but a solid ginger hit.  Seems a bit complex for a straight ginger flavor, but anything extra here works really well.  Not spooky strong, use at around .5% for an accent or up to 1.5% for a main ginger flavor.\n\nInhale is sweet, with spicier ginger top notes. Moderately dense, which is nice for a flavor that can come across as one-dimensional.  Exhale is ginger forward. Slightly spicy but not overwhelming or sharp top notes.  Sweet base, bordering on syrupy. As the exhale tails off, I get a lighter, brighter slightly bitter note a lot like lime zest.  Some lingering slighter bitter spice notes, like mulled cloves.  Still relatively full bodied and a bit of juicy mouthfeel.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  I get some complexity here beyond straight ginger. Almost tastes like a really subtle lime zest and clove note in here.  Definitely not bad, but tastes like a ginger ale.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light. Ginger is a bit aggressive, but no real throat hit beyond what you'd expect.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Good base for ginger candies.  Sweeter, deeper ginger flavor to complement the spicier top notes. Should be pretty easy to take in hard candy or crystallized ginger direction.\n\nReally good ginger for beverage applications. Mix with rum and lime for a pretty decent dark and stormy (thanks flavorah blurb writer), or take it full on ginger ale.  Also a good candidate for mixing with teas.\n\nNot really a dry bakery spice, so probably not the best choice for gingerbreads or bakeries with a spice component.\n\nWith fruit mixes, ginger should pair well apple, cherries, brighter citrus, and cranberries.\n\nMight also be a good choice for blending with creams and custards, if a ginger cream is your thing.\n  \n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, .25% has some noticeable ginger.  It's mostly in the top notes, and you're mostly getting a hit of brighter ginger. A bit dry down this low.  .5% brings in some more sweetness and body. Doesn't seem all that much spicier, but quite a bit sweeter and fuller.  Still a tad on the dry side, but not powdery like the usual holiday-spice version.  1% has quite a bit of sweetness, again not a lot of bump up in spiciness, but there's a deeper, syrupy base here.  1.5% is getting heavy and syrupy, spice level is still pretty similar but you're getting a lot more body here. 2% seems a bit blown out and muted to me.  I'd recommend using this as an accent at .5% and 1-1.5% as a stronger primary flavor.\n\nSeems fairly close to [HS Ginger](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/5sb5es/hs_ginger/) but more syrupy and further from that dry ginger spice note.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[One note on ELR, by user \"daxbender\": \"tested it at 1% and it tastes like fresh grated/chopped ginger, at 1.5% was sweeter and reminded me more of a crystallized ginger.\"](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/121201)\n\n[Heres the Flavorah product page.  Their description: \"Ginger is the fresh root with a sweet ginger ale that is brisk and bubble. Slight floral texture. Great for making beverage vapes like a dark and stormy, or for a unique and refreshing ADV. Ginger, like other spice flavors is underutilized in juice recipes.\"](http://store.flavorah.com/concentrated-ginger-flavor)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**\n\n**[Suggestions for reviews?
