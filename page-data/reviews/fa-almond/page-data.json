This flavor is something of a conundrum, I get a creamy and buttery note, along with a chalky and slightly dull note at the same time.\n\n**Relatable Flavors**\n\nThis flavor reminds me of almond milk, and eating raw almonds, as close as I've ever tasted in vapor.\n\n**Position In The Recipe**\n\nGiven its density and useful applications I would have to say this is a base note, it could also be used as an accent to bring out complex nutty flavorings in other flavors such as fa cookie.\n\n**Off flavors**\n\nThe one thing I've noticed when mixing with this flavor is I often get a strong Hospital antiseptic note, but did not perceive that in the single flavor mix.\n\n**Pairings** \n\nOther nuts, creams, bakeries, tobaccos, candies, chocolates, savory, and spice flavorings such as cardamom or vanilla.\n\n**Recipe** \n\nObviously not one of mine but I feel this recipe really highlights the flavoring well.\n\n https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/2358#vanilla_almond_milk_by_vurve\n\n**Notes** \n\nThis flavor is very strong, as are most flavor art flavorings start low and move up.\n\nIf you're interested in learning more about almonds here is a Wikipedia.\n\n https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almond\n\nAnd this is where I purchased mine.\n\n http://www.bullcityvapor.com/almond-fa/\n\n**Rating** 70/100\n\n**Please if your opinion differs, or you have another review for this flavor add it in the comments.
