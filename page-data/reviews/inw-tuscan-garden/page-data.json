Hope he doesn't mind. \n\n **Specs:**\n\n- percentage used: 3%\n\n- 1.5 months\n\n- PG/VG ratio: 60/40\n\n- vaped on Mutation X, single 26/32 Clapton; .67 ohms; ~50 watts\n\n**Type of Tobacco:**\n\n- aromatic\n\n**Flavor Properties:**\n\n- Sweet\n\n- Light\n\n- Slight bit of smokiness\n\n- Fruity\n\n**Relatable Flavors:**\n\n- Grape soda. It's kind of hard to taste much more than grape soda. Really strong in the beginning, but it's still quite up front at the month and a half point. \n\n- Smoke. After aging a while the smoke and grape soda kind of finds a balance. Hardly detectable at the beginning, it comes in eventually. It's not an FA Black Fire type of wood smoke. More like a heavily filtered flavored cigar. Think along the lines of Cheyenne cigars, if you were ever broke and desperate enough to buy those. \n\n- Cigarette shop. Not that it tastes like cigarettes, but every cigarette shop I've been in has this smell to it. Like they're all smoking in there, but they sell incense and you can kind of smell that mixed with the smoke in the air. That's the best I can describe it.  \n\n**Mouth Feel:**\n\n- medium density\n\n**Off Flavors:**\n\n- Considering Inawera describes this as a typical tobacco flavor like a cigarette, I guess grape soda is kind of out of place. \n\n**Position In A Recipe:**\n\n- I've got a feeling that this little guy is going to pop up as a top note no matter what. \n\n**Suggested Percentage:**\n\n- .5-2%\n\n**Pairings:**\n\n- tobaccos\n\n- If you're looking for a grape soda shake and vape, single flavor at 3% and get 'er gone before the smoke shows up\n\n- Anything that might taste good with grape soda? Maybe pair it with a gathering of the Juggalos? Hash tag Faygo hash tag ICP\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- I read a review that the grape goes away after a long steep. A month and a half is as long as I'm willing to wait. I have a feeling that to get it completely gone, you'd just have to wait until all the flavor molecules completely go away. \n\n- I gave it a shot in a mix, just to see. \n\nINW DNB-1.5%\nINW Garuda- 1%\nINW Tobacco Symphony- 2.5%\nINW Tuscan Garden- .5%\n\nIt tastes like a grape Cheyenne. So take that as you will. \n\n\n\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ChemicalBurnVictim","title":"Tuscan Garden","url":"https://redd.it/6ata2j","vendor":{"name":"Inawera","code":"INW"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"INW","title":"Tuscan Garden"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
