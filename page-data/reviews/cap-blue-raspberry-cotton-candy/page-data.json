    "result": {"data":{"reviewsJson":{"markdown":"**Setup:** Recoil w/ flavor barrel, Dual 15 wrap 26g 3mm Nifethal 70 coils @.18 ohms.  60w power, 450F temp limit. Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** CAP Blue Raspberry Cotton Candy@ 4%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 22 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Fluffy blue sugar, bordeirng on burnt.  It's a true commercial blue raspberry flavor, in that it just tastes \"blue.\"  No real discernible ties to actual fruit.  Again, this is cotton candy so I guess that's okay?\n\nInahle is just slightly bitter sweetness. Dense but not smooth.  Bitterness opens up on the exhale and starts to resemble spun sugar. Blue flavor on the beginning of the exhale with a lingering aspartame and almost creamy vanilla on the tail end.  Sticky sweet, dense, and dry.\n\n**Off-flavors:** I get a bitter aspartame edge to all that sweetness. \n\n**Throat Hit:** 7/10.  This is pretty rough solo.  Kind of like actual cotton candy, it's both super sweet and dense without being wet.  Both of those do weird things to my throat.\n\n**Uses:**  I'd use this an assisted primary note, or as a sweetener in a blue rapsberry juice.  Like [this](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/9179) by /u/apexified/.\n\n**Pairings:**  Hibiscus apparently, which is genius. Shoutout to /u/barkenator/ for dropping that [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/3xuh0r/cap_blue_raspberry_cotton_candy_question/)  Strong relatively artificial dark berries (FW Razzleberry, FLV Boysenberry, FW Blueberry). Vanilla or Meringue to make the spun sugar notes more pleasant.\n\n**Notes:**  This is surprisingly realistic, I'm just not 100% sure thats a good thing in this case.  This also requires a pretty decent steep.  I think this is damn near unvapable for at least a week if not two.\n\nS&V testing is challenging here.  I get a noticeable flavor all the way down at 1%.  If you're using this a sweetener I'd stick to under 2% or that sugar note is going to be popping up in weird places all over your juice.  As a primary, this works all the way to at least 8%. Plenty of people recommend this up higher, but that sweetness is almost too much for me at 8%, and anything higher just doesn't rub me the right way.  The harshness doesn't seem to be as linear as that sugar note, but this is pretty rough at anything above 3%.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[OP finds it really rough. Comments largely disagree](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/3xuh0r/cap_blue_raspberry_cotton_candy_question/)\n\n[ELR flavor notes, mostly high single flavor percentages.  Good flavor notes by Loud N Cloudy down at the end](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/12643)\n\n[Polarized opinions on ECX.  Some maniac even suggests pairing it with bubble gum.](http://www.ecigexpress.com/diy-e-liquid/diy-e-liquid-flavors/capella-flavor-drops/cotton-candy-by-capella-flavor-drops.html)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Blue Raspberry Cotton Candy","url":"https://redd.it/5fkund","vendor":{"name":"Capella","code":"CAP"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"CAP","title":"Blue Raspberry Cotton Candy"}},
