    "result": {"data":{"reviewsJson":{"markdown":"**Setup:** Recoil w/ flavor barrel, Dual 15 wrap 26g 3mm Nifethal 70 coils @.18 ohms.  60w power, 450F temp limit. Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** CAP Golden Butter@ 4%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 26 days for the solo.\n\n**Flavor Description:** This tastes almost identical to CAP Butter Cream to me, with volume turned up a bit from like 2 on the buttercream to a whopping 3 or 3 1/2. Tastes quite a bit like homemade buttercream frosting, especially as this seems noticeably sweeter than CAP Buttercream.  Waxiness is also more pronounced. I get intermittent still fairly faint dairy notes here.  Like sweet cream butter, as opposed to a richer diacteyl popcorn butter note.\n\nInhale is mostly dense sweetness.  Weird thing is, it's one the cleanest sweet notes I've got from a concentrate.  Like straight sugar syrup. Exhale brings in what I get from the dairy note.  Sweet, non cheesy butter.  Clear sweetness here too.  I could be imagining it, but the sweetness kind of has a really thin vanilla character to it.  Lingering waxy mouthfeel.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  The entire thing? For me at least this isn't really butter, but a thick unctuous sweetness. That unctuous vibe gets waxy really quick.\n\n**Throat Hit:** 0/10.\n\n**Uses:** Dense, rich, thick mouthfeel for creams and cream mixes.  If you get butter from this, then sweet cream butter notes for your bakeries.\n\n**Pairings:** If you get butter, relatively dry pastries. If you get buttercream frosting, then the world is your oyster.  Just don't expect it to translate for any given other person.\n\n**Notes:** I'm absolutely convinced there is something here that I'm not tasting.  This shouldn't be as subtle as is, both as the steeped tester and the S&V percentage testing.  Given the reaction on CAP Butter Cream, I don't think I'm alone.  I get a much clearer butter taste out of something like Cap Vanilla Whipped Cream.  As with anything, it's worth trying this as a single flavor first to see what you're getting out of this.\n\nS&V tasting, I get an almost identical level of actual dairy from this at .5% as I do at 4%.  Sweetness does seem a lot more linear, rising up to 6%. Waxiness seems to show up early, and plateaus at around 4%.  Given that I'm missing something here I would follow the recommendations in the second opinions and start low with this.  .5% to start and work up.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Seems like /u/avtomal5150/ got about the same thing from this as I did.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/4o6a74/looking_for_the_most_diketonerich_preferably/)\n\n[Differing opinions on ELR Notes, Primarily the heavy butter camp.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/1225)\n\n[Seems like some more mixed opinions on Vaping Underground](http://vapingunderground.com/threads/looking-for-a-good-tasting-butter-flavor-yes-i-know-they-have-diacetyl.121442/)\n\nSo, overall I'm stumped here.  I don't hate this as a textural additive but I'm obviously not getting something that is supposed to be there.  Seriously, YMMV.\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Golden Butter","url":"https://redd.it/5ghpty","vendor":{"name":"Capella","code":"CAP"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"CAP","title":"Golden Butter"}},
