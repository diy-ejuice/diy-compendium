    "result": {"data":{"reviewsJson":{"markdown":"**Setup:** Recoil RDA. Dual kanthal clapton coils @ 0.3 ohm. 50w power, Cotton Bacon wicks. \n\n**Testing:** INW Bubblegum @ 1%, 2.5%, and 4% 70/30 VG/PG, Steeped 5 and 12 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Authentic classic pink bubblegum. Not dry or stale enough to read as Topps baseball card gum, not chalky enough to call it Dubble Bubble, but lacking the mouthwatering quality it would need get into Bubblicious or Big League Chew territory. Some thickness, but lacking a chewy texture. Most like a gumball machine gumball in classic pink flavor. Inhale is soft pink, top of the exhale starts with a sharper pink gum flavor that quickly softens and gathers some volume, though not quite enough to be called chewy, and ends with an even softer, more powdery (but not chalky) sweetness. \n\n**Off-flavors:** None at 2.5% and below. \n\n**Throat Hit:** None.   \n\n**Notes:** 1% is a full-flavored bubblegum vape but lacks the bit of texture this picks up at 2.5%. That texture still isn't enough to sink your teeth into and chew, but it's a bit of thickness that does contribute to a more bubblegummy vape. 4% starts to bring in a weird warmth like freshly ABC gum, which is kinda gross, like kissing someone and having them leave their gum in your mouth. It's a warmth similar to what you'd get from a candy cinnamon flavor, without the cinnamon flavor. Longer steeping doesn't seem to have much effect on it. \n\n**Uses & Pairings:** 2.5% standalone for a straight up bubblegum vape. I'd experiment with additives that might give it some of that mouthwatering aspect of gum - low percentages of things like Cactus or Pink Guava or citrus flavors or Yakima Hops, for example. Or thickening ingredients like Vanilla Swirl or a marshmallow at no more than 2% for chewiness. Or sweetener, if you swing that way. Some combination of the above. \n\n1% or less with various fruits, if you want something like a fruit gumball that combines both the classic pink gum flavor and your fruit of choice. Don't expect to add this to grape and get grape Bubblicious, though. For that you want texture, this one is much more pink flavor than chewy mouthwatering gum texture, which is what you want for top-notch fruit gum. You're not going to be able to cover up the pink and get just gum-ness out of it. I hear mixing with this is tricky because it's a bully and I have reason to believe it: 2% of this added to 8% total of three FA fruits is a solidly bubblegum flavor with fruit accents in /u/drumbtr's [recipe](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/35867#blow_my_strap_on_by_drumbtr) that I initially bought this for. I had a bottle of my Mother of Dragons' Milk recipe with a 1:1 sub of CAP Dragon Fruit for the TFA version that I'd been vaping on and just for fun, just added roughly 2% INW Bubblegum (YC) to that. Shake and vape testing, definitely a bubblegum-forward flavor with a dragonfruit backdrop. It's... interesting, but tasty.  \n\nA more conservative use that likely allows other flavors to share the limelight can be seen in this [Late Night Gum](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/47809#late_night_gum_by_trandism) recipe by Trandism. \n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nNot really, but if you want opinions on other bubblegum flavors, check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1r57eRMHJM) where I talk them over with co-hosts MlNikon, CheebaSteeba, and a guest. Summary for those who don't want to watch: Everyone has their own favorite bubblegum flavor, and this one is mine. Also, don't accidentally go out in search of INW Bubble Gum (yc) and accidentally buy INW Purple Gum. It's laundry detergent. I'll do a full review on that one once I have a chance to do some lower concentration testing and see if it gets palatable below 1%. \n\n**Just for Fun:**\n\nIf you're a drinker and a bubble gum lover, there's bubblegum vodka, but that involves the embarrassment of buying bubble gum vodka. If you want to be able to show your face in the liquor store again, try a shot of 2 parts Irish cream, 1 part banana liqueur, and 1 part blue curacao. Tastes like bubblegum! \n\nBe sure to check out all of the other great reviews at \n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**\n","author":"ID10-T","title":"Bubblegum yc","url":"https://redd.it/6kp56m","vendor":{"name":"Inawera","code":"INW"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"INW","title":"Bubblegum yc"}},
