    "result": {"data":{"reviewsJson":{"markdown":"**Setup:** Goon LP, dual parallel 25g SS316L @ 0.1 ohms, 100w, full cotton wicks\n\n**Testing:** [Liquid Nicotine Wholesalers Pineapple](https://liquidnicotinewholesalers.com/lnw-pineapple.html) @5%, steeped for two days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Candy Pineapple. I was a bit disappointed that this didn't taste the way that it smelled. A whiff of the bottle made me think of canned pineapples in syrup. At 5% this tastes like pineapple Pez. There's an almost chalky dryness to this flavor that isn't bad, just not evocative of fresh or canned pineapple. Candy pineapple all the way.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Chalky dryness. Not in a bad way if you want candy. IT could be fixed with juicier flavors.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Not much, but the dryness is rough after a few hits.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:** Candy, Tropical punch (the cheap but tasty kind), another dimension to a fruit blend. This isn't the worst pineapple flavor out there by any means.\n\n**Notes:** LNW told me that all their concentrates should be used between 5-20%; I think that is crazy. this could be used lower in a recipe as an accent. I wouldn't go above 7% solo.\n\n**Second Opinions:** these are new flavors, so there is nothing else out there yet...","author":"PerennialPhilosopher","title":"Pineapple","url":"https://redd.it/68c6hx","vendor":{"name":"Liquid Nicotine Wholesale","code":"LNW"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"LNW","title":"Pineapple"}},
