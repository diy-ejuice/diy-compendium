This flavour can be mixed with other cold beverage flavours to create your own unique flavours.\" They suggest MIXED 2-5% SOLO 5-9%.\n\n**Notes:** When I mixed it I tasted it on the back of the hand it is tasted like you just sipped some room temperature Scotch, but when vaped fresh it had a pretty strong chemical note. With some woodiness and some scotch on the end of exhale. It also left a lingering taste of scotch. After 14 days on the nose is smells very woody and scotch like. When vaped chemical note is still there on the inhale, but the exhale is all barrel aged scotch. It does have a WS-23 like coolness on the very end of exhale.\n\n**Pairings:** Obviously cocktails, would be great with  tobaccos, could be used with bakeries if you wanted a woody scotch/whiskey note.\n","author":"ebc88","title":"Scotch Whiskey","url":"https://redd.it/8fsa3z","vendor":{"name":"Vape Train Australia","code":"VTA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"VTA","title":"Scotch Whiskey"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
