I also get a dull, bitter, dry thing going on with this flavor.\n\n**Relatable Flavors**\n\nReminds me of off-brand Cola not quite Coca-Cola but still good.\n\n**Off Flavors**\n\nA strong aftertaste not necessarily unpleasant also. extremely harsh until about 3 weeks out.\n\n**Position In The Recipe**\n\nThis could be a very useful drink base, or used as an additive to dry out other more wet flavors at low percentages.\n\n**Pairings**\n\nDark berries ,some fruits such as Apple, vanillas, tobaccos, a few cream flavorings such as vanilla bean ice cream, and a handful of spices like nutmeg, cardamom, and cinnamon.\n\n**Recipe**\n\nhttps://alltheflavors.com/recipes/share/4da7a438-bd0d-4831-83f2-f9b7e6370ecc\n\n**Notes**\n\nAs always here is a Wikipedia on Cola I personally found very interesting I'm drinking a lot of this garbage and never knew what actually went in it.( outside the obvious sugar )\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cola\n\nAnd a link to where you can find it.\n\nhttp://www.ecigexpress.com/diy-e-liquid/diy-e-liquid-flavors/inawera/fruit-and-sweet/cola-by-inawera-10ml.html\n\n**Rating** 75/100\n\n**Please if your opinion differs, or you have another review for this post it in the comments. Will help the master list with multiple reviews in one spot.**\n\n","author":"Chrisdvr1","title":"Cola","url":"https://redd.it/4wlwav","vendor":{"name":"Inawera","code":"INW"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"INW","title":"Cola"}},
