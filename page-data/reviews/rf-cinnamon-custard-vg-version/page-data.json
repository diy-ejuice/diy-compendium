If anyone knows anything I should do differently feel free to let me know. I promise I won't cry ;) Maybe...lol\n\n&nbsp;\n\nPlease understand these are just my opinions, and I have only been mixing for about 8 months. I hope it helps. These flavors really do need at least a 4 week steep to fully develop the flavors. VG just doesn't carry the flavor like PG. However, even using higher percentages, if they are single flavors it's not using any more flavoring than they usual 15-20% of combines flavors that is commonly used with a lot of flavoring. These are not super concentrated like INW or FA.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Cinnamon Custard**\n\n- Tested 10% @ 1 week steep. I'm in love! Even at only 1 week steep! Delicious warm sweet vanilla pudding with freshly ground cinnamon. As others have said, this is the same cinnamon as in their bread pudding. This reminds me very much of rich rice pudding with cinnamon, minus the rice. Creamy, thick, warm, OMG ADV stand alone flavor. Can't wait to try this at a 4-8 week steep, I can only imagine. I need to make a lot of this or none will make it to a full steep. Did I mention I'm in love ;) You must get if you are a custard lover like me. Or if you want an amazing cinnamon.\n- At a 4 week steep. I am still in love. This has thickened slightly, and the cinnamon has really settled in.  This is a cinnamon heavy custard, not just a hint. Very well balanced, not overwhelming, and the fresh ground cinnamon flavor has survived the steep. A very unique and one of a kind custard. I will be using this in many bakery/dessert recipes, as well as a SF.\n","author":"mysticrosell","title":"Cinnamon Custard VG Version","url":"https://redd.it/4rhepj","vendor":{"name":"Real Flavors","code":"RF"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"RF","title":"Cinnamon Custard VG Version"}},
