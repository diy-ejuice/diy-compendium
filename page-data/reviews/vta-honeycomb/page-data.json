With some bakery style notes.\n\n**6%:** Getting some slight harshness. Very buttery bakery type notes. fairly sweet guessing thats the honey part because i do not get a distictive honey taste. Medium bodied mouthfeel.\n\n**7%** Bakery notes are more at the front now. Still got some buttery sweetness. The harshness is no worse than it was at 6%.\n\n**Final Thoughts:** VTA's suggested percentages seem about right to me. I didn't get any werid off notes. Did get the slightest bit of harshness the higher i pushed it. This should have a wide range of useages in just about any bakery recipe. Although i didn't get any distinct honey flavor, so if you are looking to use it for a honey note in a recipe you will have to look elsewhere. This should pair up nicely with FLV milk & honey to give that honey note though. This at a fairly medium body mouthfeel at all the percentages i tested it. All & all this is a pretty solid flavor & made a pleasant single flavor vape. \n","author":"ebc88","title":"Honeycomb","url":"https://redd.it/88vwm5","vendor":{"name":"Vape Train Australia","code":"VTA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"VTA","title":"Honeycomb"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
