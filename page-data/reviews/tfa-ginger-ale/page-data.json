It's not thick or dense, but almost a little \"sticky\" or \"viscous\" if that makes sense. I get little to no effervescence, which I was hoping would be present. Overall I enjoy the flavor, but it misses the mark to be an all inclusive ginger ale, so things like liquor, champagne, spices, etc. may be desired in a mix. Slightly sweet, not so much so that additional sweeteners would be unwarranted. Although the flavor is prominent, it is slightly in the back, so if you want it to be more present you may need to use a higher % in a mix.   \n\n**On the Nose**  \nMostly very sweet ginger, slight hint of spice\n\n**Recommended Usage**  \n*Stand alone*: 4-8%\n\n*In a mix*: 2-6%.  \n\n**Throat**  \nMild, very mildly effervescent feeling\n\n**Ideal Pairings**  \nCitrus, other spices, liquors/cocktails, menthol/cool, dark berries\n\n**Avoid**  \nI would think like melons probably.\n\n**Steep**  \nPretty Good right away. I don't notice much of a difference from 1 day - 2 week steep  \n\n**Recipe Idea: Spiked Ginger Ale**  \n*Steep:* S&V\n*Ratio: 20PG/80VG*  \n  \n* TFA Ginger Ale @ 4%  \n* (Insert Desired Liquor here at appropriate %) *FA Jamaican Rum @ 1.5%*  \n* TFA Champagne @ 3%  \n* TFA Koolada @ 0.75% (to taste)  \n\nSo here I think the Ginger Ale is definitely the star of the show, getting a little boost from your desired liquor and benefitting from the sort of \"watered-down\" effect from the champagne as well as a slightly more present illusion of effervescence. I like the Koolada to add \"ice\" to the drink which I feel is necessary. You should be able to use just about any liquor here that you like (bourbon, brandy, whiskey, etc.) and have good results; I went with Jamaican Rum since I wanted the ginger ale to be a little spicier and have that boozy tone to it. \n\n*Please if your opinion differs, or you have another review for this post it in the comments. Will help the master list with multiple reviews in one spot.*","author":"CheebaSteeba","title":"Ginger Ale","url":"https://redd.it/4uteqk","vendor":{"name":"The Flavor Apprentice","code":"TFA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"TFA","title":"Ginger Ale"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
