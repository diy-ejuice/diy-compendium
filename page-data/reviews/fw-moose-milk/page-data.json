    "result": {"data":{"reviewsJson":{"markdown":"**Setup:** Plume Veil RDA; dual parallel @ .35Î©; cotton wicks; 45W\n\n**Testing:** FW Moose Milk @ 3%; Aged: 15 days\n\n**Flavor description:**  Sugary pastry with a dusting of cinnamon and very light vanilla.  Had a hint of chocolate initially, but it is not present after a steep.  This flavor seems very light and gives an airy sensation after steeping at 3% with no milky nuances to me.\n\n**Throat hit:** 2/10\n\n**Uses:**   Adds a subtle sugary cinnamon pastry note without being too over-powering.  An option in bakery or pastry recipes.\n\n**Pairings:**  Apple, biscuit, cookie, other pastry or bakery flavors\n\n**Notes:**   Purchased as a recommendation in a clone I was working on.  \n\n****\n**FYI: THIS FLAVOR CONTAINS SUGAR SYRUP.**\n****\n  [Source](http://juic.org/flavors/concerning-flavors/) thanks to /u/abdada.  Please research the effects of vaping sugar syrup and use at your best discretion.  \n\nEDIT: [Link to all of our flavor reviews in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)\n","author":"wh1skeyk1ng","title":"Moose Milk","url":"https://redd.it/54zj23","vendor":{"name":"Flavor West","code":"FW"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FW","title":"Moose Milk"}},
