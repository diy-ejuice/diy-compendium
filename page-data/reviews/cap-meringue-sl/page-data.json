Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Capella Silverline Meringue, 4% and 8%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 10 days.\n**Flavor Description:**  Crunchberry cereal milk?\n\nThe meringue here feels more like mostly sweetness and texture rather than any real distinct flavor. Light maltiness more than a distinct bakery flavor. Capella says this is a cross between meringue and a meringue cookie, but I’m missing any real cookie notes. Fluffy and moderately dense, with a prominent sweetness.  Light dairy note here but it tastes more milky than creamy.  A lot closer to something like FA Fresh Cream than a richer dairy flavor. Doesn’t feel particularly crunchy, and nothing that tastes like a more toasted baked meringue.\n\nSo, that thing where people use FA Meringue for a cereal milk vibe?  It seems like Capella wanted us to hold their beer and they added crunchberries to it.   There’s something fruity in here and it really does taste a lot like that kind of generic red berry fruitiness of said crunchberries.  Nothing really distinct enough to nail down to a specific kind of red fruit, but that fruitiness kind of pervades the entire vape.  If this is a meringue, they steeped the thing with crunchberries before whipping the egg whites. \n\nSweetness level overall is fairly high.  Capella does say this has sucralose in it, and it could be the power of suggestion, but I do a get of a sweetener edge.  Just going off MSDS, this is 90-100% propelyne glycol, so it’s under 10% sucralose by volume.  For what it’s worth, I didn’t notice much real coil gore or wick carnage after vaping around 15ml of this. \n\nComparing this FA Meringue, I feel like the SL version seems a bit softer overall.  FA meringue has a drier “crunch” to it, and while this has some of the fluffy texture it doesn’t seem as dry to me.  FA meringue seems to have a more eggy taste and a clearer vanilla.  This feels a bit more netural except for that red fruit thing.\n\n**Off-Flavors:**  Generic red fruit flavor.  Sucralose pre-installed, so that might be an issue.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light? Doesn’t feel particularly dry but there is something a bit throaty with that berry thing.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 4%,  this doesn’t really come together for me.  Thinner, with a dry berry and malt taste. Doesn’t really feel full or fluffy. \n\nAt 8%, this is working substantially better.  A bit heavy on the sweetness, but the texture is working quite a bit better and soaking up those berry and malt notes well.  Doesn’t feel too dry or crunchy.\n\nJust based on these tests, this seems to be working quite a bit better higher.  Sucralose is a bit more prominent, but I’d be using this a base flavor somewhere between 8-10%. \n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  So, the cereal milk thing.  I’m not sure this has the “crunch” for the outside of cereal like FA Meringue, but it has some of the same malty vibe and that berry note is going to work well for fruitier cereals.  The thickness is also going to work for a milky or creamy profile.\n\nDoesn’t really feel dry enough for the powdered sugar on bakeries thing that FA Meringue does, but it feels like the texture would carry something like a pavlova or other meringue based desert with heavier bakery notes around it.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  Nothing much via the google yet. \n\n[Here is the product page from Capella.  Their description: “Light and fluffy with the perfect mix of egg and sugar, this is a combination of the soft fluffy meringue on a pie and the airy crunch of a meringue cookie.”](https://www.capellaflavors.com/meringue.html)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Meringue SL","url":"https://redd.it/8i4rvd","vendor":{"name":"Capella","code":"CAP"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"CAP","title":"Meringue SL"}},
