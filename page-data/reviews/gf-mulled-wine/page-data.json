Fairly dense I give it a 7/10\n\n**Throat Hit**\n\n 4/10 I'm assuming this is from the spice mixture.             \n\n**Flavor Properties** \n\nSweet red wine, spiced with clove a hint of cinnamon, a little anise, Ginger and citrus I'm assuming Orange. ( this could also just be the ginger it can take on citrus note depending on where it is grown )There is probably a little nutmeg in there as well considering that this is traditional but I'm not picking it up.    \n\n**Relatable Flavors** \n\nThis tastes like a sweet dessert wine with plenty of extras to give it character. \n\n**Position In The Recipe** \n\nBase or top note. This flavore should be easy to build on, and the spices are really going to take the top note in most recipes.\n\n**Pairings** \n\nMost citrus fruits in particular tropical and orange will pair nicely, also thinking that a mint will really bring this flavoring to life. Should also play nicely with tobacco's and dessert flavorings such as cake.\n\n**Recipe**\n\nhttps://alltheflavors.com/recipes/7027\n\n**Notes**\n\nThis is a pretty fantastic standalone flavoring with plenty of punch at 5%. Was hoping for more of a dark red wine not a big fan of sweet wines, may need to pick up something bitter to push it to that dry dark red wine place.           \n\nhttp://www.vaperstek.org/mulled-wine-aroma-flavor/            \n                            \n**Rating** 85/100                \n\n*Please if your opinion differs, or you have another review for this post it in the comments.
