The first pull after shaking was very chocolate forward. Almost like melted dark chocolate, with a hint of tobacco to follow. It feels like the balance is off here somewhat, a more robust tobacco note would be really welcome here to pair with the dark chocolate.\n\n\n**After a week:**      \nThat chocolate forward flavor is still very present, the tobacco has started to become slightly bolder but it still feels like it needs help. The richness and heaviness of the chocolate notes haven’t changed much if at all.\n\n**Off notes:**      \nI don’t see it as an off note, but nothing led me to believe that there would be chocolate here until I smelled it. I can’t imagine it’s unintentional though, and they did a good job of leaning into a dark chocolate without somehow ending up in the realm of waxy artificial chocolate. .\n\n**Throat hit:**   \nMilder than expected, minimal “bite”\n\n**Suggested pairings:**      \nRich vanilla custards, dark fruit, whiskey/bourbon, more robust tobacco, caramels. I don’t think you can totally get away from the tobacco undercurrent, but it feels as though it will lend itself well to embracing the flavor for what it is and transforming it to your needs.\n\n\n[DIY_Ejuice’s Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)","author":"Foment_life","title":"Old Captain","url":"https://redd.it/cf8bof","vendor":{"name":"Super Concentrated","code":"SC"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"SC","title":"Old Captain"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
