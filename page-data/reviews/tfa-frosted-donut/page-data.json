    "result": {"data":{"reviewsJson":{"markdown":"**Setup:** Plume Veil RDA; dual parallel @ .35Î©; cotton wicks; 45W\n\n**Testing:** TFA Frosted Donut @ 5%; Aged: 6 days\n\n**Flavor description:**  Very sweet and cakey.  Not an overly dense cake, but not too airy either.  I would almost pass the \"frosted\" part off as more of a melted powdered sugar on the tongue if you will.  Definitely more of a cake than a donut though.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  I don't taste anything off at 5%.\n\n**Throat hit:** 4/10.  \n\n**Uses:**  I can see this working as a cake, and it would likely play well in any bakery or dessert recipe. \n\n**Pairings:** Fruits, creams, nuts.  Could potentially benefit from the addition of a thicker cream.\n\n**Notes:**  To me, this comes off as more of a cake than a donut, but still a good one to have in your arsenal if you're trying to develop a tasty bakery recipe.\n\nEDIT: [Link to all of our flavor reviews in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)","author":"wh1skeyk1ng","title":"Frosted Donut","url":"https://redd.it/4o4j1y","vendor":{"name":"The Flavor Apprentice","code":"TFA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"TFA","title":"Frosted Donut"}},
