Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Vape Train Mango Juice, 3% and 7%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 14 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Fairly mellow and thick mango flavor.\n\nThe mango here seems a bit flat to me, but that’s probably the profile for a mango juice.  More of a dull sweet mango than anything really bright and intense.  Feels fairly close to a generic yellow peach flavor with some mango accents.\n\nFairly un-piney as far as mangoes go, but it’s there.  The top notes have a light to moderate underripe mango greeness.  It’s not overwhelming at all, but it seems to be at least present especially in the higher sample.  I don’t think it’s green enough to be a “deal-breaker” but it’s a component of the flavor. \n\nThere’s something buttery in the base here that doesn’t quite fit with a fresher or nectar type of mango.  Seems maybe just a bit buttery, but not a rancid type of butyric. Feels like the heavy, rich part of an overripe mango without the funkier, muskier parts.  It sort of reminds me of some of CAP Sweet Mango without the heavier rotten note.\n\nMouthfeel overall is moderately full.  Feel fairly thick, but not really juicy.  Actually starts to feel a bit dry with extended vaping.   Sweetness level seems pretty on point for a mango nectar.  Sweetened, but not candied.\n\n**Off-Flavors:**  Duller mango, mouthfeel is a bit dry for a mango juice.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light.  Seems to get a bit dry but nothing super harsh or unexpected.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 3%, this is fairly thick but indistinct.  I’m getting more mouthfeel than actual mango.  Not a lot of pine, but i’m missing any brighter, vibrant mango.  A little bit of that richness.\n\nAt 7%, the mango is clearer but still not really bright.  Still dense, almost feels a bit buttery.  Light to moderate pine notes.  Seems to be getting a bit dry.\n\nVape Train suggests mixing this at 3-5% or standalone 5-10%.  That’s probably in the ballpark, but I don’t dig this as a standalone.  Just based on these tests, I’d probably go with 4-6% to thicken up another mango or peach.  \n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Out of the 3 vape train mangoes I’ve tried, this probably does taste the most like mango nectar.  Shisha Mango is brighter and sweeter, and green mango is definitely green.  With that said, I’d still probably grab FLV Mango for a mango nectar type flavor, and given the relative strengths the value proposition isn’t markedly different.\n\nThat richness here seems better suited for backing up another mango instead of using this as a primary mango flavor.  I’d use it to thicken up and reinforce a brighter mango like VT Shisha Mango without making the whole thing feel too overripe like CAP Sweet Mango.  It could probably pull the same trick with more realistic peach flavors, getting you to a fuller peach that doesn’t taste like candy.\n\nPairing this, should work well with the usual suspects for a mango.  Strawberry, Pineapple, Coconut, Guava, etc… \n\nI could also see working this into something like a mango cream.  I don’t think the relatively lighter pine notes are going to really show up against a richer cream flavor and then the thickness and almost buttery richness is probably going to be an asset.\n\nAlternatively, this could be a really interesting mango to pair with tobaccos if that isn’t completely over by now.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  Again, coming up empty handed on second opinions.\n\n[No description, but here’s the product page from Vape Train.](https://www.vapetrain.com.au/shop/vt-concentrates/cheesecake-flavour-concentrate-diy-for-e-liquid-recipe-making/)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Mango Juice","url":"https://redd.it/8essa0","vendor":{"name":"Vape Train Australia","code":"VTA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"VTA","title":"Mango Juice"}},
