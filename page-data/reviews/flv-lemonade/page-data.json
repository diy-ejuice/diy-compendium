{"componentChunkName":"component---src-components-review-js","path":"/reviews/flv-lemonade","result":{"data":{"reviewsJson":{"markdown":"**Setup:** Plume Veil RDA; dual parallel @ .35Î©; cotton wicks; 45W\n\n**Testing:** FLV Lemonade @ 3%; Aged: 7 days\n\n**Flavor description:**  Very sweet lemony flavor, sugary, and rather dense on the tongue even at 3%.  Has some tang/tartness, but not too much.  Dry initally, but seems to develop some wetness after a steep.  Reminiscent of a lemonade powder mix.  More of a \"Country Time\" lemonade powder than say \"Crystal Light\".  \n\n**Off-flavors:**  None noticed.  \n\n**Throat hit:** 5/10. \n\n**Uses:**  Obviously a staple in a lemonade or even a tea type mix. (Think Arizona's Arnold Palmer)  Could be used to sweeten up a bitter lemon or any bitter citrus for that matter.  Would also work well in a lemon dessert with the help of something like FA Lemon Sicily to tone down/round out the sweetness factor.\n\n**Pairings:** Light fruits, citrus fruits, bitter fruits, tea, meringue, champagne, possibly some lighter creams.\n\n**Notes:** Not bad as a 3% standalone flavor, but seems to become more interesting at a lower % when mixed with other fruits.  There are probably endless possibilities to its uses with other fruit flavors.  \n\nEDIT: [Link to all of our flavor reviews in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)","author":"wh1skeyk1ng","title":"Lemonade","url":"https://redd.it/4oae32","vendor":{"name":"Flavorah","code":"FLV"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FLV","title":"Lemonade"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
