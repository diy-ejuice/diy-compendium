Very rich, lots of butter, silky butterscotch and cream. I don't taste any pie crust but rather I get all delicious filling. This is a very sweet and decadent flavor. \n\n**Off-flavors:**  None to speak of. \n\n**Throat Hit:** None here, super smooth flavor\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I can see this flavor being used at low percentages to add some complexities and creaminess to caramels or at higher percentages to be the main butterscotch note in a custard or bakery. Basically, anywhere you want a butterscotch flavor this would work very well, except maybe if you were going after a hard crack/candy like butterscotch. \n\n**Notes:** I am noticing a pattern with WF that I personally like, and that is that their flavors are very sweet. I am not sure if these are supposed to be one shot type of concentrates or not but so far everything I have tried has been very good but very sweet. Some people may not want to add a lot of sweetness in their mix. If you are going for a tobacco or dryer type of bakery these flavors may not be the ones you want to reach for first. \n\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"mlNikon","title":"Butterscotch Cream Pie","url":"https://redd.it/5pk7sl","vendor":{"name":"Wonder Flavors","code":"WF"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"WF","title":"Butterscotch Cream Pie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
