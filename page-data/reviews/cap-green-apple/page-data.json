    "result": {"data":{"reviewsJson":{"markdown":"*English is not my primary language, so bear with me*\n\n**Setup:** Original Hadaly, 70W, fused clapton, 0.2 ohms, cotton bacon, 3 weeks steep, tested at 3%.\n\n*Freshly mixed:* \nCandy green apple with a good body.\nLemon off notes on the inhale that overlap the apple itself.\nSweet and floral, but i can't identify what kind - they just get buried under all that lemon. Low throat hit, medium dryness. Without peel notes or pulp. Acetone off notes.\n\nDuring the steep the lemon tastes oxidized. Not fresh at all, like some cheap wiping floor detergent.\n\n*After steep:* Strong lemon flavor, oxidized, just not as unpleasant. Very sweet, no acetone off notes,\nstill no peel. The apple flavor got a little faded away, it will need layering here. The lemon notes still overpower the apple itself. Some floral notes, just not as evident.\n\nOverall its still somewhat of a good pick for a green apple candy, considering the options out there in the market.\nBut it haves downfalls and still needs some tweaks to drive it where you want it. Mixing it with INW Anthon apple or\nFW green apple will just bring the acetone to unbearable levels. This would be my best pick for a green apple candy, till i found FM green apple.","author":"KillScreen-","title":"Green Apple","url":"https://redd.it/84r5el","vendor":{"name":"Capella","code":"CAP"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"CAP","title":"Green Apple"}},
