From a lot of \"US Red\" and similarly named flavors I tend to get kind of a harsh, Sweetart kind of taste. I think they think this makes them taste like Marlboro Reds for some reason. This one is a bit more mellow. The smell in the dripper has a bit of a maple vibe to it, but it's not really sweet. I tend to taste a bit of a fruity thing going on in a lot of HS tobaccos, but I'm glad to say I don't get this here. It's a bit dry. To summarize: dry, cocoa, maple-ish, tobacco leaf. \n\n\n**Recommended Pairings**\n\nI'll just summarize the \"Most Commonly Used With\" from ELR:\n\nRY4 flavors \n\nAcetyl Pyrazine\n\nSweeteners\n\nCreams/Marshmallow \n\nButterscotch\n\nDirty Neutral Base (probably the only one I'd use with)\n\n**Off Notes**\n\nFor what I'd imagine is supposed to be a cigarette flavor, I wouldn't expect cocoa and maple. But it's not a bad flavor. \n\n**Notes**\n\nAs far as HS tobaccos go, this has probably been my favorite so far. That said, I will still probably be grabbing other things for tobacco mixes. It's not very strong, even at 5%. My experience would tell me that I'll need a bit more in a mix so that it doesn't get lost. It's not bad, not great. I've seen a lot of praise for HS tobaccos, so I'm hoping someone else will be able to tell me why it's great.
