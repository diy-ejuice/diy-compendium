After 3 weeks, the spice really comes out and turns a bit thicker, almost like a hint of real molasses.  This flavor has kind of an overall woodsy taste, but isn't \"woody\".  Kind of like walking through a forest during a drought.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Reports of alcohol or perfume at higher percentages.  Personally, I get nothing \"off\" here @3% unless you were expecting \"7 leaves\" to be a green plant with 7 leaves :)\n\n**Throat hit:** 6/10, dry, but still mellow\n\n**Uses:** Decent shake and vape by itself at a lower percentage if you enjoy a bag of Bali Shag rolling tobacco or something like Drum or Top in a can with a subtle sweetness.  Also good as part of a cig tobacco base.\n\n**Pairings:**  Other tobaccos, nuts, AP, maybe a touch of your favorite fruit or cream if you prefer.\n\n**Notes:**   This definitely works well as a shake n vape if you're after something resembling rolling tobacco.  It is very light and mellow, but steeps into something slightly thicker, remaining fairly mellow.\n\n[Link to all of our flavor reviews in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)","author":"wh1skeyk1ng","title":"7 Leaves Ultimate","url":"https://redd.it/5iybf2","vendor":{"name":"Flavour Art","code":"FA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FA","title":"7 Leaves Ultimate"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
