I have been doing reviews for commercial liquids as well as hardware for over a year and a half and I wanted to do something a little different. Over the course of the next few weeks I'll bring reviews ,recipes and notes on Wonder Flavors, Flavorah, FlavourArt,Liquid Barn and Flavor Monks. So stay tuned! \n\nI was sent 15 flavors from the amazing folks at Flavor Monks in Belgium and I can honestly say, these are some really, really top notch flavors. I'll be posting more as often as I can until they're completed. I have also chosen to feature a recipe that I've been working on which compliments this featured flavor as well as some other flavors from Flavorah, FlavourArt and a couple TFA. I hope you enjoy it! Suggestions and feedback are 100% welcome. \n\n**Setup**\n*Lost Vape Therion DNA 166 with an Augvape Druga RDA running dual framed staples(6*.5 Ribbon, 26GSS frames and 40GN80 Wrap)*\n\n**Tested Percentage**\n*10% as recommended on the bottle*\n\n**Main Tasting Notes**\n\nI was a hesitant to mix this at 10% but I figured it was best to stick with the recommendation on the bottle,10% worked really well but the high percentage of stand alone does not translate into a mix the same as I'd treat CAP or TFA. I used this at 2% in a recipe and it was real strong and dominant. I will start off by saying that the authenticity of this Blackberry is astounding, it's unlikely any I've had and I fear of ever running out of it. \n\nOn the inhale I get this real big and juicy dark berry taste. When I say juicy, I mean it. Its this juicyness that had me mixing it into a recipe to try and capture that texture and mouthfeel. The Blackberry hits really quick, as soon as you've noticed that juicy texture the Blackberry is right there with it. The only way that I can describe the taste is via Wild Blackberry. We have them growing all over our farm and I load up on them in the late summer. \n\nTheir taste is distinct and different from a normal Blackberry. They are considerably juicier, much sweeter and have a very strong Blackberry flavor. When I took that first inhale off this, I was instantly reminded of Wild Blackberry. The flavor rolls off your tounge really smoothly on the exhale and the Blackberry forms a bit of tartness but only the slightest,some may not even notice it. The Blackberry after taste lingers for a few second after the exhale than fades.\n\n**Off Flavors**\n Absolutely none, the only thing I am getting here is a really genuine and authentic tasting blackberry. \n\n**Pairings**\n\nThis can fit into just about any fruit mix, keep in mind that even though the solo % is 10%, in a mix this stuff comes across pretty strong so I'd look at .5% for soft background notes and perhaps 1-1.5% for more Blackberry forward notes. \n\n**Recipe**\n\"The Great Grapesby\"\"\n\n- FA Bilberry-0.25%\n- Flavor Monks - Blackberry- 1%\n- FLV Blueberry-0.15\n- TFA Champagne-0.25%\n- FA Fuji-1%\n- FLV Grape-1.75%\n- TFA Marshmallow-1.5%\n- FLV Moscato-0.25%\n- SugarDaddy Sweetner-0.75%(or sweetner of choice)","author":"Lampburglar","title":"Blackberry","url":"https://redd.it/7crthe","vendor":{"name":"Flavour Monks","code":"FM"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FM","title":"Blackberry"}},
