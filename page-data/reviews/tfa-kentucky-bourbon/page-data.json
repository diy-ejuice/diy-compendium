It doesn't.  It tastes more like sugar with a slight hint of alcohol that fades out after a few days, with the remaining flavor being comparable to the scent of a night club at 10 o'clock the next morning:  stale beer and spilled drinks.  Having been in these places the morning after, this flavor brings out a feeling of nostalgia I never realized I possessed until now.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Not bourbon.  Sugary taste, and stale spilled drinks on carpet.  See above.\n\n**Throat hit:** very slight. Maybe 2/10\n\n**Uses:**  ~~You can probably skip this one unless you're looking for a light sweetener that tastes like the bottom of a glass of vodka and sprite long after the ice has melted.~~  I have not played around with this flavor enough to find a use for it, however [Drunken Pears](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/4dcjoj/drunken_pears_v_20/) by /u/matthewkocanda and [Bangin Bourbon Bread](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/3o809o/new_autumn_adv_bangin_bourbon_bread/) by /u/skiddlzninja are 2 fairly popular recipes here where I have seen it put to good use.\n\n**Pairings:** Maybe some fruits if you want to give them a dirty fermented effect, ~~otherwise the trash can or \"remove from cart\" button on your next order.~~  I paired it with 4% FA Torrone, and it was OK.  I would assume tobaccos would go well with it as well.  I will continue to play with it and report back if I find other decent pairings.\n\n**Notes:** Maybe I need to try a different percentage, but this flavor seems too sweet to be considered \"Kentucky Bourbon.\"  I'm an avid drinker of all types of whiskey, and this doesn't resemble the taste of whiskey by a long shot. \n\n**Rating:** ~~0/5 stars.  Sorry TFA, this flavor was a huge let down to me judging strictly on taste vs product description.  I can only hope FA Whiskey does a better job on resembling whiskey.~~\n\nEDIT:too\n\nEDIT 2:  I apologize for the rather \"bitchy\" rating.  I have since stopped rating flavors with stars.  I understand taste is very subjective, and I hope someone adds a better review in the comments.  I did mix this with some of my standalone FA Torrone today, and was rather impressed.  I see that it has it's place in a recipe, and is not meant to replicate whiskey 1:1.","author":"wh1skeyk1ng","title":"Kentucky Bourbon","url":"https://redd.it/4nyw0h","vendor":{"name":"The Flavor Apprentice","code":"TFA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"TFA","title":"Kentucky Bourbon"}},
