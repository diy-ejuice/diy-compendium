Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Apple Pop @ 1% and 1 drop per 10 ml (about .25%), 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 9 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Not really a full apple flavor. More like sweetened apple peels. Based on other available concentrates, I'd call this a mashup of that drier, sweetened powdered instant cider note from HS Apple mix, the candy sweetness I get from FA Fuji, and the spicy peel note from TPA Quince.\n\nInhale has a lot of volume with slightly dry, sugary \"apple juice\" kind of candy sweetness.  Exhale has a deep sweet candy red apple base.  Pronounced spicy dry peel notes.  Again, lots of volume without being very dense. Sweetness has a powdered instant cider character to it. Lingering sugar lips and dryness from the peel here.\n\n**Off Flavors:** The peel / skin note is pretty pronounced and a bit spicy. Fairly accurate, but a bit jarring in a sweeter apple flavor.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light, more from the dryness of that cidery apple sweetness and the spicier peel.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:** Flavorah suggests this to add dimension to complex apple flavors, and that seems like a pretty decent idea.  I've used TPA Quince to add a realistic peel note to an apple, but this seems like a better fit. It's a fuller at low percentages, and the apple here has a clearer, brighter flavor. Should work well to complement a crisper apple flavor.  A bit sweet, but should have the same effect with pears.\n\nGood way to add some apple juice sweetness to a fruit mix.  I'd watch the peel and avoid dryer fruit flavors, but should work well in the background of brighter, juicy fruit flavors.\n\nA bit too much peel to work well with creams as a primary fruit note.\n\n**Notes:**  S&V concentration testing, keep this low.  At .25% I get a softer apple sweeteness and a pretty restrained dry, spicy, peel note. .5% has a more candy edge to the apple, but that peel note is ramping up pretty quickly. .75% is drier and spicier than .5% without much added depth or sweetness. By 1% the peel is pretty dominant, although the apple underneath is still a prety mellow, sweet candy flavor. 1.5% takes that dry peel note too far.  I'd start with this at .25% for an accent note for other apple flavors, and .5% for an apple flavor in a fruit mix without another prominent apple flavor.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nNot a ton.\n\n[/u/chewymidget/ posted a downright opulent strap-on using all flavorah.  It includes Apple Pop.  Here are the notes:  \"Apple pop seems to be a cross between a Fuji apple and a candy apple. This very strong and is incredibly juicy... You can almost taste the skin at 1% but it over takes the whole mix so .75% is where I have it sitting.\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/5wygtq/march_2017_recipe_thread/dfaepsp/)\n\nNo ELR notes, BCF or ECX reviews.\n\n[Heres the description from Flavorah: \"Sweet red apple notes.
