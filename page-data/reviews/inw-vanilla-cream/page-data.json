The vanilla notes are light and sweet. Mouthfeel is weird, it leaves a sweet, fatty feeling.\n\nOff-flavors: Feint floralness, not existent at 1% and below\n\nThroat hit: None, maybe a bit dry  \n  \nToughts:  \nA very light flavour that that should read as \"Vanilla **Cream**\", the creaminess is pronounced and its a very mixable falvour, not a good standalone.  \nI tried  \n\n*  1% Vanilla Cream IW  \n*  1.5% Spearmint Cap  \n\nAnd love it.  \nAlso very good milk/cream base, no need for meringue/sweet cream mixes, this one does good.","author":"ihatetoridethebus","title":"Vanilla Cream","url":"https://redd.it/5ytvn8","vendor":{"name":"Inawera","code":"INW"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"INW","title":"Vanilla Cream"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
