{"componentChunkName":"component---src-components-review-js","path":"/reviews/fe-avocado","result":{"data":{"reviewsJson":{"markdown":"**Setup** RDA/ Derringer Clone/ 7 wrap 24g N80, 3mm ID 25-30 watts\n\n\n\n**Testing** Steep Time/2 days and a week % Used/ 4% PG-VG/ 65/35 Nic 1mg\n\n\n\n**Description**\n\nIndistinct creamy thing. Almost buttery in aroma and mouthfeel. I can't say I have had a cream flavor like this. It has no dairy or vanilla or real butter taste to it. Doesn't feel oily in the mouth nor has it got any vegetal notes. I can't put my finger on what it really tastes like. It's not earthy, floral, nor green. It feels delicate and very decadent. If I had to describe this in one word it would be 'elegant.'  A complex aroma that seems like it would fit in more places than not.\n \n**Recommended Pairings**\n\nThis could be a cream base on its own at 3-4%, could see this boosting other cream profiles around 1-2%. \n\n\n* basil\n* butter\n* cucumber\n* this would make an excellent boost to any cream/custard flavor\n* tropical fruits (lychee, mango)\n* citrus fruits (thinking grapefruit or lemon or lime, yum) definitely the more zesty/juicy type flavors\n* some nuts (walnut?)\n* maybe orange/tangerine\n* I wouldn't pair a real avocado with vanilla but this flavor would work with most vanillas out there to make them creamier\n\n**Off Notes**\n\nI cant say anything is really off. It doesn't taste exactly like avocado but nothing is off about it. Avocado is a subtle yet complex sort of buttery thing: this concentrate is that. \n\n**Notes**\n\nI don't know what else to say about this one. This single flavor test is very enjoyable. It's an extremely comforting vape that doesn't attack your palate but rather it caresses it. It's creamy and smooth like a damn avocado. Does not change much over a short steep.\n\n**Second Opinions**\n\n\nseriously could not find anything. please go try this. If I didn't make it clear, this shit is yummy and weird but in the best way\n\n\nEdit: I'm going to just add on that I think this may go with almost any fruit, especially berries. To test this I will be mixing this with blueberry and reporting back.","author":"HashSlingingSlashur","title":"Avocado","url":"https://redd.it/6j29c3","vendor":{"name":"Flavor Express","code":"FE"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FE","title":"Avocado"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
