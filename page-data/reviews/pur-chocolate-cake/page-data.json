If any dry notes occur while vaping this flavor, a simple added cream will resolve the issue!\n\n**Manufacturer Suggested Percentage:** 5-10%\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Aroma:** Chocolate, cake.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Flavor Description:** This does taste similar to chocolate cake. It reminds me of a light chocolate cake or cupcake, although it seems slightly dry. An authentic cocoa type flavored chocolate, not dark and bitter, nor sweet like milk chocolate. I'm not getting any frosting, just the cake. I'm not getting much in the way of mouth feel, I do feel it needs a longer steep.The chocolate isn't strong enough for a fully flavor saturated chocolate cake really, just too light. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:** None\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit:** 2/10\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Uses:** It would be a good base or additive to work with for any chocolate cake, especially good with Purilum Chocolate Cherry to create a solid base for a black forest cake. It needs moisture, some type of cream maybe? Would be great with Flavorah Chocolate Deutsch to add more depth. Would be  to help add body in creating chocolate puddings, creams, or custards.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Notes:** Very mild chocolate, I'm not sure increasing the percentage will really help strengthen it. I'm afraid it might also increase the dryness. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Other Opinions:** From louiesquared on ELR: This is a really great Chocolate Cake. I cranked the heat up on this one and it got even better. It has a bit of a Brownie taste but not quite as rich… It’s more of just a slightly under cooked cake.","author":"mysticrosell","title":"Chocolate Cake","url":"https://redd.it/75esal","vendor":{"name":"Purilum","code":"PUR"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"PUR","title":"Chocolate Cake"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
