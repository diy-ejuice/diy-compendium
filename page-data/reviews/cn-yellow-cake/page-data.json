I would describe it has having a fluffy/cakey density.\n\n**Throat Hit** 1/10\n\nExperienced no throat hit.\n\n**Flavor Properties**\n\nNice fluffy and slightly moist cake taste with the sweetness having a slight caramel taste to it. The taste is slightly darker/heavier than a real yellow cake.\n\n**Relatable Flavors**\n\nMost similar to the taboo FW Yellow Cake but this also has some similarity in texture and taste to FLV Cupcake Batter. \n\n**Update**: to get most similar taste and to substitute for FW yellow cake use this at 2-3 times the % called for FW yellow cake in a recipe. Not quite as potent as FW yellow cake but just as good IMO. \n\n**Off flavors**\n\nWhile I wouldn’t consider it an “off” flavor it does have a slight caramel taste to it which may just be how I am interpreting the sweetness.\n\n**Position In The Recipe**\n\nWould make an excellent base note for bakeries.\n\n**Pairings**\n\nCreams and fruits. Could see this working well in a parfait recipe or taking the direct replacement at 2-3 times the % called for FW Yellow Cake.\n\n**Recipe**\n\n**Bronuts SANS FW Yellow Cake**\n\n7% CAP Glazed Donut\n3-4% ChemNic Yellow Cake\n.75% INW Biscuit\n.75% FA Joy\n\n**Notes**\n\nI was eager to try this newly released flavor to pt it against the venerable FW Yellow Cake that has yet to have a “safe” replacement. ChemNic recommends 10-15% of this flavor as a standalone so I started with 10%. It can stand on its own at 10% but it is very simple yet still enjoyable as a single flavor. First thing I set off to do with it was subbing it for FW Yellow Cake in my old favorite Bronuts (props to /u/enyawreklaw). The short of it is that this flavor works as a FW Yellow Cake replacement. Comparing original Bronuts to the subbed version I seem to be noticing less of the “waxy” chocolate taste. That you /u/chrisdvr1 for the formatting I borrowed from. I am a complete n00b for flavor notes as you may have noticed from some of my other posts but got to start somewhere I suppose.\n\n**Rating** 95/100\n\nClose enough to replace FW Yellow Cake\n\nhttps://www.chemnic.com/DIY-E-liquid-Flavoring/ChemNic%20Flavoring/Yellow-Cake-Flavoring","author":"R08U57","title":"Yellow Cake","url":"https://redd.it/4vi08m","vendor":{"name":"ChemNic","code":"CN"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"CN","title":"Yellow Cake"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
