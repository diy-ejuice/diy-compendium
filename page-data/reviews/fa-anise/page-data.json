This tastes like a slightly wetter and less strong version of TFA Absinthe.  It has a very smooth yet unmistakable fluffy black licorice taste with a light and slightly creamy mouthfeel.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Nothing completely unexpected, although one could argue it is a bit creamy and sweet.\n\n**Throat hit:** 3/10 pretty mellow and light\n\n**Uses:** Great for adding some body along with a dark star anise sort of flavor.  Has a tendency to \"cool\" recipes at lower percentages.  Maybe try this in place of Koolada for a less menthol sort of approach. Above 1.5% it really starts to come alive.  There are [ramblings of it being fairly linear even above 4%](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/48) which is rather uncharacteristic for an FA flavor.\n\n**Pairings:**   Dark fruits, citrus fruits, chocolate, herbs/spices, caramel, even some mints, and possibly some tobaccos would pair well here.\n\n**Notes:**  This could definitely be a love/hate type of flavor.  If you don't like black licorice, you can probably pass on this.  If you're like me and don't like black licorice but are trying to acquire a taste, this might help bridge that gap with it's forgiving sweet and creamy properties.  If you love black licorice, check out [TFA Absinthe](https://redd.it/5lppmx), which carries a darker, dryer, and a bit more harsh and true to life anise flavor.\n\n[Link to all of our flavor reviews in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)\n\nedit: fixed link\n","author":"wh1skeyk1ng","title":"Anise","url":"https://redd.it/5lpfzd","vendor":{"name":"Flavour Art","code":"FA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FA","title":"Anise"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
