It's pretty accurate to how I imagine a yellow watermelon to be. Can taste it's a bit different to a red watermelon. It's more mellow, although doesn’t lack flavour, and has an almost honey-ish note. Has a nice juiciness and I get a little bit of rind. Overall it's pretty refreshing. I also get some lingering watermelon flesh and rind after exhaling. \n\nMouthfeel/ Texture: its pretty juicy. I pick up on a bit of graininess/ mealiness, like watermelon flesh. \n\nOff Notes: none\n\nThroat Hit: none\n\n% Testing: at 2.5% it's pretty full flavoured. I’d probably use it a bit lower in a mix. Maybe around 1% as an accent, 2% as a main note? \n\nUse and Pairings: anywhere you want a more mellow, less aggressive watermelon that is going to sit a bit further back in the mix, rather than being right up front. Would be good in a melon mix or fruit mix. Or a cocktail/ beverage. \nBecause it's pretty refreshing I'd like to try pairing it with other refreshing flavours, maybe something like cucumber or citrus to make a nice summery vape.","author":"-DixxleRoo-","title":"Watermelon (Yellow)","url":"https://redd.it/hp4ixa","vendor":{"name":"Wonder Flavors","code":"WF"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"WF","title":"Watermelon (Yellow)"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
