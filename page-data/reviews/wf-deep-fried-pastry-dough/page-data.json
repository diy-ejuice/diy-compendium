Steeped for 4 weeks and tested once a week. Flavoring was purchased from GREMLIN DIY\n\n\nWonder Flavours Description:\nA deep fried pastry dough with light notes of spice. They suggest mixing 1-4% \n\n\nFreshly mixed:\nOn back of hand taste sweet and doughy. Vaped it doesnâ€™t have much flavor at all. \n\n\nWeek 1:\nGetting a strange borderline rotten fruit note and some oiliness. \n\n\nWeek 2: \nFruit and oil are both still there and are over taking any dough like notes. Also the spices WF mentions in the description are coming through. \n\n\nWeek 3&4:\nBoth off notes are still there and seem to have gotten stronger. Taste like someone had some raspberries that were about to rotten. Breaded them and put some all spice or nutmeg on them. Then deep fried them. Threw the raspberries away then decided to vape the left over oil. Sorry not trying to sound like    \n/u/id10-t but that is the best way i can describe what i am tasting. \n\n\nI rate this 2/5 i would of rated this lower but \n/u/mlNikon made it work very well at 1.5% in the recipe i tested this flavor in. \n\nhttps://alltheflavors.com/recipes/64495#guava_empanada_by_mlnikon","author":"ebc88","title":"Deep Fried Pastry Dough","url":"https://redd.it/84s9cu","vendor":{"name":"Wonder Flavors","code":"WF"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"WF","title":"Deep Fried Pastry Dough"}},
