Hard to pick out individual berries, but if I had to try, I'd say blackcurrant, blackberry, blueberry, maybe a hint of raspberry. I don't notice any medicinal or off flavors with it. It's not very tart, like you might expect from a mixed berry blend. You can really go a lot of different directions with this one. I have been wanting to do a fruit tart and I think this flavoring would play a very important role in that. \n\n**On the Nose**  \nBerries. lul. \n\n**Recommended Usage**  \n*Stand alone*: 5%\n\n*In a mix*: 2-4%. I've actually seen this be used successfully as high as 7%, but it was overcoming a strong mint\n\n**Throat**  \nModerate to Harsh; sharp. Calms down significantly with steep, and can be tamed with creams or other volatiles.\n\n**Pairings**  \nCreams, other fruits, mint, melon, Citrus, chocolate, tobaccos. \n\n**Avoid**  \nNot too sure here, berries go pretty well with just about everything.\n\n**Steep**  \n2 days. Noticed significant reduction in throat after 1 week\n\n**Quick Recipe: Berry Creamy**  \n*Ratio: 15PG/85VG*  \n*Steep: 4+ days* \n\n* FA Forest Fruit @ 2-4% (I like it at 2%) \n* FLV Cream @ 1%\n* TFA Marshmallow @ 2%\n\nHere you really get an idea of what Forest Fruit tastes like, while giving you some creaminess to tame the throat and provide some body/balance, and some sweetness that I feel it needs.
