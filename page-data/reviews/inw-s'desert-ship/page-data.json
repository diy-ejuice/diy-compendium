Some clove in there too. On the floral side of things, but not offensive. There may be some tobacco leaf somewhere in there, but it's masked pretty well behind the herbal/floral notes. Leaves a kind of numbing sensation on the tongue like clove cigarettes. Not completely different than FA Desert Ship. Maybe not as strong. \n\n**Off-flavors:** If you're looking for an herbal/spice/floral tobacco, there's nothing off about it. \n\n**Throat hit:** Pretty mellow. 3/10\n\n**Uses:** Could be a primary flavor or a backing note. I think this one is pretty versatile depending on what you want it to do. \n\n**Pairings:** Other tobaccos, fruits (personal experience with INW Peach is a good experience), basically anything you can think of that would work with a licorice and clove flavor. \n\n**Notes:** I'm usually not a fan of herbal and floral notes in my mixes, but this one I can make an exception for. If you're having a hard time with FA Desert Ship, try this one. I think it's more forgiving at higher percentages. I could never go above 2% with FA, but this one will blend with the other flavors in your mix even at 4%. \n\n**Bonus Recipe**\n[My Peach tobacco](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/recipe/1115562/New%20Money)\n\n\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ChemicalBurnVictim","title":"S'Desert Ship","url":"https://redd.it/5mr1jr","vendor":{"name":"Inawera","code":"INW"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"INW","title":"S'Desert Ship"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
