Flavor rounds out to a more typical guava/papaya flavor. Pretty much spot on papaya. It reminds me of a tropical starburst sort of flavor/mouthfeel with a twist of ripe as fuck peach thrown in. \n\n**Off-flavors:**  Typical papaya funk at the end, but if you enjoy papaya you'll enjoy this.\n\n**Throat Hit:** 1/10\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Thinking this could stand up to some boozy or minty pairings. Might play well with Kiwi or Cactus. Maybe a papaya lemonade would work.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nI'm afraid to push this over 1% as it is a very strong flavor. I could see this being a polarizing flavor with some finding the weird peach notes a turn off. Call me weird, but I kind of enjoy it. As previously mentioned, it does have that papaya musk finish.\n\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n[Echoing the musky finish](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/25lj65/tfa_papaya/)\n\n[The reason I actually picked it up was to make this fairly well reviewed Monster Melons clone.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/recipe/127149/Mikes%20Melons%20\\(Cuttwood%20Monster%20Melon%20Clone\\)#)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"vape_account","title":"Papaya","url":"https://redd.it/5shx5q","vendor":{"name":"The Flavor Apprentice","code":"TFA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"TFA","title":"Papaya"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
