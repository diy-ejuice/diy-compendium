This creamy mixture of fruits can be used for some of the most unique recipes!\n\n**Manufacturer Suggested Percentage:** 5-10%\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Aroma:** Pineapple, coconut, cream.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Flavor Description:** Creamy sweet coconut. It's like the Coco Lopez Cream of  Coconut, not fresh coconut or milk. Great body and thickness to the cream.  Medium strength artificial pineapple, not as prominent as the coconut, but still a good blend. The pineapple has no acidity or bite that usually is present with fresh pineapple. I'm getting a very slight floral background note occasionally, not strong enough to be bothersome. It tastes very much like a very creamy and sweet virgin pina colada. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:** Very faint perfume occasionally, not offensive.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit:** 2/10\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Uses:** I can see this making a great pudding or creamy dessert component for cakes or danishes, cookies, shakes, blended beverages, fruity cocktails. Ice cream or sherbet with a little koolada or WS-23. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Notes:** Good strength for a single flavor around 6-8%. Maybe 2-5% in mixes.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Other Opinions:** From louiesquared on ELR: Nice creamy blend of pineapple and coconut with a hint of citrus on the exhale. I really like this. It’s very clean and fresh tasting. It’s been at least 20 years since I’ve eaten Ambrosia but this nailed the profile quite well. I recognized the flavor right away.","author":"mysticrosell","title":"Ambrosia","url":"https://redd.it/75ek7u","vendor":{"name":"Purilum","code":"PUR"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"PUR","title":"Ambrosia"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
