Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Bubble Gum @ %1 and 1 drop per 10ml (about .25%), 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 7 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Nothing too complicated, pretty much just bubble gum. Normal, chalky, and pink bubblegum.  Dense, dry mouthfeel with a tiny bit of spearmint-like cooling. Pleasantly boring, actually.\n\nInhale is dense and dry, with some sharper pink bubble gum flavor.  Flavor opens up a bit on the exhale.  I get just that basic pink bubble gum taste up front, but you start to pick out a bit of floral vanilla and a spearmint coolness as the exhale goes on. Just a tiny bitter edge to the top notes, accurate to pink bubble gum. Mouthfeel is dry and dense, bordering on chalky.  Not crazy sweet, but has an authentic level of candy sweetness in here. Some lingering spearmint and almost a really light clove or something similar.\n\n**Off-flavors:**Not really.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light. Fairly harsh as a S&V, but seems to calm down fairly quickly.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Bubble Gum, mostly. Flavorah suggests mixing with top heavy flavors, and I'd have to aggree.  You want something relatively dry to maintain the texture here. The actual flavor isn't too overwhelming, so should work well as a generic bubble gum base. I'd stick to brighter flavors like candy watermelon, Strawberry, or Kiwi. Good place for slightly floral flavors like Raspberry and Peach. Anything too juicy is going to moisten up your bubble gum base too much.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, .25% is too weak. Thin, unsaturated and a bit sour. .5% is better, giving you a more clear bubble gum and filling out the concentrate. Mouthfeel is still a bit weak here though. 1% has a heavier mouthfeel, and doesn't really have an overbearing pinkness to it. 1.5 and 2% still don't have any weird off-flavors, but that chalkyness is getting a bit pronounced.  The cooling here is also starting to get fairly noticeable. By 2% you're getting almost a wintergreen altoids vibe in there with the pink bubblegum. 3% is probably a bit too far, as the vape is getting a bit too dry and harsh and the pink flavor is getting sharp and chemical. I'd suggest starting with this at 1% and working up.  If you're starting with a juicier flavor that you want to dry out a bit, try starting at 2%.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Heres the FLV Product Page. Their description: \"Taste reminiscent of baseball dugouts and bubble tape, or Bazooka Bubble gum sticks. Vapes as expected, with a friendliness for berry or anything top heavy and purfume like. \"](http://store.flavorah.com/concentrated-bubble-gum-flavor)\n\n[One note on ELR, pretty much saying it's a bit harsh but solid.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/98751)\n\n[JBird has a recipe up for a flavorah melon gum on ATF. Their notes: \"FLV nailed this profile. A very good base to add your favorite fruits to. No chalkiness like I get from TFA and not as harsh as FW.\"  I do get a bit of chalkyness, but I think it's a fit for the profile.](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/35898#honeymelon_bubble_gum_by_jbird)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Bubble Gum","url":"https://redd.it/64wl07","vendor":{"name":"Flavorah","code":"FLV"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FLV","title":"Bubble Gum"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
