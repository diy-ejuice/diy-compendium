If you've ever tasted Dulce de Leche ice  - cream (Haagen Daaz) you'll understand why this flavor is so popular. -   \n\n* **ACCURACY :** &nbsp; &#128308; &#128308; &#128308; &#9898; &#9898; &nbsp; CLOSE - BUT COULD BE BETTER  \n\n----------  \n**&#128313; Flavor Description &#128313;**  \nMongrel RDA SS316L 3*28/38 3mm ID spaced 5/6 wrap.\n\n1% Very slight sweetness with the typical Sucralose after taste. Nasty bitter, light and airy milk nothingness. Poor flavor of not yet burnt sugar that’s almost caramelized. \n\n1.75% Slightly sweet, cooked milk and caramelized sugar is starting to really come out now.\n\n2.5% Cooked milk and burnt sugar notes are more pronounced. Seems to be muting itself leaving a weak caramel note mixed with too much air. Getting a waxy chocolate off note that’s not very good, like the cheap children’s chocolates that have been sitting in a mom and pop’s store since when their first grandchild was born.  \n\n**&#128313; Comments &#128313;**  \nContains Acetoin and Acetyl Propionyl (Custard ingredients)\n\n1% Throat hit 3/10.  Itchy on the throat. Astringent, slightly acidic and bitter. Percentage is too low to be of any use other than to ruin a mix with a dark caramel for support.\n\n1.75% Throat hit 4/10. Same as above except this is probably the percentage to start with in a mix. Still getting a fairly metallic-like Lactic Acid\n\n2.5% I wouldn’t use this in a mix past this percentage.","author":"kuri_sanTou","title":"Dulce De Leche","url":"https://redd.it/ojv2zo","vendor":{"name":"The Flavor Apprentice","code":"TFA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"TFA","title":"Dulce De Leche"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
