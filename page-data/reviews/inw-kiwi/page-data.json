This is my first actual flavor review, so if you have any questions or think I should have added something, please let me know!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSetup: Wasp Nano, Nichrome Alien at .3 ohms , organic japanese cotton wick\n\nTesting: Inawera Kiwi @ 2%, 5%, and 8% steeped 1 day and 1 week (3% nicotine for all)\n\nFlavor Description: \n\n⦁\tDay 1 at 2%, I get a faint sweet kiwi that is fairly authentic. When I bumped the percentage up to 5, it startied tasting a bit more on the candy side. Still not that overpowering. Initial reaction is that this would be good as a offnote, but would easily get overpowered. Likely pairs well with other tropical fruits. The sweetness is still there which may be good for people who are looking for sweetness but do not want to add any actual sweeteners. 8% did pretty much what I expected. Same thing as 2% to 5% except more intense; I am getting a lot more candy than authentic kiwi now. Barely any throat hit even at 8%.\n\n⦁\tAt one week not a whole lot has changed across the board. 2% is still a really nice sweet kiwi. 5% and 8% still have a nice flavor to them, they just became more candy-like.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPairings: I think this one is pretty straight forward. I think at low percentages, INW Kiwi could add sweetness and another fruit to tropical vapes. I also think this would go very nicely with a yogurt or cream base as well.","author":"UnappreciatedRobot","title":"Kiwi","url":"https://redd.it/bnrebf","vendor":{"name":"Inawera","code":"INW"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"INW","title":"Kiwi"}},
