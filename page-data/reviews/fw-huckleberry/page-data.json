Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FW Huckleberry@ 3%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 35 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  A dark, sweet berry base that tastes like artificial blueberry with a hint of a darker blackberry.  Some balanced tartness and lighter perfumey top notes.  A bit of cooling herbal mint and anise kind of bite.\n\nInhale is all deep, almost syrupy dark candy blueberry. Dense and heavy with just a bit of harshness. Exhale is sweet, with blueberry syrup right up front. Higher, floral blackberry notes with a slight cooling herbal mint tinge and a spicy anise / basil bit of spice.  Fairly subtle blackcurrant tartness and funk. Sweet, but reads as mostly natural with no aspartame edge.  Dense but just a bit dry, lacking a really juicy, syrupy edge.  Lingering spicy, dry notes and a bit of waxy mouthfeel. \n\n**Off Flavors:** Light cooling spearmint / anise on top. Not ovewhelming, but it's there.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Nothing major. Those top notes get a little floral and harsh over 2%.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Good, relatively complex base for a blueberry mix.  Seems like a punchier version of TPA Blueberry Extra. Heavy enough body to stand up as a good primary note in mixes.\n\nGood candidate to provide most of the body for a blueberry cream or custard mix with some help from something like FA Bilberry for a more realistic blueberry or FW Blueberry for a candy blueberry.\n\nIn bakeries, I think this should work as a kind of commercial \"blueberry\" kind of flavor. With some added liquid amber or a jammy fruit in the mix it should do a good job of pulling off some of the deeper sweet flavor of a blueberry jam.\n\nGood candidate for a blueberry-esque berry note for a dry sweet tobacco. Strong enough to stand out, but not juicy enough to swamp a mix.  Doesn't seem to have any of that red berry woodiness or heavy syrupy texture.\n\n**Notes:** S&V concentration testing, seems to be best between 1.5-2%. I get a fairly weak flavor at .25 and .5%. Just some light indistinct berry sweetness. 1% has a fairly full flavor, but it lacks some definition. 1.5% is good, with a nice mix of sweetness and a clearer dark berry flavor. 2% has those cooling herbal mint show up, but as a light accent to the blueberryish depth here. 3% is a bit sharp and floral, still workable but I'm getting some harshness. 4% is pretty solidly floral, and the berry sweetness isn't really any better or stronger than 2%.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Good reviews on BCF. Suggested pairings with creams and grainier pastries like FA Cookie, INW Biscuit, rice crispies.](http://www.bullcityflavors.com/huckleberry-fw/)\n\n[More good reviews on ECX. Cream pairings suggested again.](http://www.ecigexpress.com/diy-e-liquid/diy-e-liquid-flavors/flavor-west/huckleberry-by-flavor-west.html)\n\n[Pretty short and to the point, but /u/SadPandaVapes/ posted up a huckleberry ice cream recipe using FW Huckleberry. The recipe note: \"Huckleberry FW to me is a stronger, richer blueberry flavor.\"  Later clarifies that it is, indeed a \"normal flavor\" unlike the ultra potent TFA Huckleberry and the usage percentage is 1-4%.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/3gx014/feel_like_contributing_here_is_a_huckleberry_ice/)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Huckleberry","url":"https://redd.it/624uvo","vendor":{"name":"Flavor West","code":"FW"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FW","title":"Huckleberry"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
