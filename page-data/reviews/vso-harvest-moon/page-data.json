It’s not quite a ‘Pumpkin Spice’, but it is very similar to one.  There’s alot going on here, but at @ 14% it comes together really well.  The Pumpkin is very accurate (for once), and the Spices are well-chosen.   Since it’s made with natural extracts, there pretty much no off-notes...  which is quite an accomplishment.  I can’t tell you how many other pumpkin-spiced flavors have either destroyed my tank or laid waste to my taste buds.\n\nIf you‘re looking for a more natural pumpkin vibe, go with VSO’s straight-up *Pumpkin* flavor.  If you’re looking for a more cream-forward experience, *OSDIY Pumpkin Spice Cream* is an absolute killer.  But if you want a delicious, complex vape to go with your morning coffee, Harvest Moon is the way to go.  One thing’s for sure - VSO knows how to rock a Pumpkin.","author":"DeeeGenerate","title":"Harvest Moon","url":"https://redd.it/jllz9p","vendor":{"name":"Vaping Swag Originals","code":"VSO"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"VSO","title":"Harvest Moon"}},
