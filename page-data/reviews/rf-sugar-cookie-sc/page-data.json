Single SS Clapton 26g/36g, 6 wrap/3mm id (30-40 watts)\n\n\n**Testing**: RF Sugar Cookie 2%, aged 1 day and 11 days\n\n\n**Flavor Description**: \nThis is more like sugar cookie batter than a finished sugar cookie. Got a real birthday cakey taste. Not very buttery though. Very sweet, you can almost taste sugar granules on the exhale. It’s lacking any crunch to it but the whole thing is really well done. This is a very good place to start for a sugar cookie base or to add a little something to your cakes/cookies. If I had to say this reminds me of something it would be a no name sugar cookie you’d find at a supermarket with a decent bakery section. No huge change in flavor with a steep, I had no problem S&V this.\n\n\n**Off-flavors**: Tastes like cookie batter/dough so I guess that’s a little off.\n\n\n**Throat Hit**: Nada\n\n\n**Uses & Pairings**: \nThe sky’s the limit here imo (I guess bakery is the limit in actuality). Add some FA cookie or JF biscuit for that crunch and you’re half way to a Royal Dansk butter cookie. This is going to be a great sub for cake batter/cake batter dip that contain DA/AP for those who are averse. I really can’t see where this wouldn’t fit considering it’s a sugar cookie and you kind of know what you’re signing up for. \n\n\n**Notes**: \nI need to test this at lower % especially in some mixes to see what it can add. I feel like this is kind of what I wanted from CAP/JF yellow cake, I know that sounds weird but this kind of has that yellow taste you get from cake batter / sugar cookie batter. I can really see this working in a lot of recipes and I am sure many have picked it up when it was free a couple weeks back. \n\nObvious comparison is CAP sugar cookie, this RF is truer to what I expect from a sugar cookie. Where CAP is buttery and has amazing mouthfeel, this one is brighter and sweeter with a little less body. This won’t be as versatile as CAP’s just because for me Capella Sugar Cookie v1 is just not a straight sugar cookie. Capella’s is like some delicious buttery bakery beast that can be molded into other things like waffles, cakes, cookies, pies, cereals, custards and even ice creams. The RF sugar cookie is plain and simple a sugar cookie and will be slightly more limited in use. \n\n\n**Second Opinions**:\nCouple notes on ELR about the VG based one, one states: [Real Flavors recommend 8-10% going by my past experience I mixed this at 12% as I find I need a little higher personally.Shake and Vape , Deep Water Ti build .006 ohms at 55.0 watts.Nice strong , very sweet sugar cookies as in the homemade kind with lots of sugar on top.Nice doughy feel , best sugar cookie flavor I have found.Good enough standalone but can see lots of possibilities with this one.I would drop it in the 8% range though for a mix .](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/80848)\n\nNotes on ELR about the SC version: [Very nice Sugar Cookie flavoring authentic taste. Not enough depth for stand alone. Use as a base in bakery profile Eliquids. \nWorks well at 2.5%, Shines at 3% of mix](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/129244)\n\nNot a lot else out there. Here’s a link the to Real Flavors Page and their little blurb:\n[Soft, moist holiday cookies with a sugary coating…there’s nothing better to enjoy with a hot beverage. Now you can get your fill of these classic baked treats without the calories.]( http://www.realflavors.com/shop/sugar-cookie-super-concentrate/)\n\n**They ain’t wrong** I would recommend this to anyone.\n\n\n[Link to all flavor reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)\n\n\nedit: this is tested at 30% PG and 1.5mg nic","author":"HashSlingingSlashur","title":"Sugar Cookie SC","url":"https://redd.it/6ebahw","vendor":{"name":"Real Flavors","code":"RF"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"RF","title":"Sugar Cookie SC"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
