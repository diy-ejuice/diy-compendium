The inhale is the best part of this one, like smelling a freshly sliced mango. The exhale is where it gets slightly weird, it starts off great and kind of fizzles out. Its got a lot of the mango top notes, which is good, but its lacking anything juicy or nectar like. I’m getting a decent flavor in the beginning, slightly floral/sweet/bright/creamy but on the exhale I lose a lot of those positive notes and I’m left with a lightly mangoed, slightly creamy vg taste. This one lacks any real body or juicy factor to it.\n\n**Off-flavors**: Not a 100% spot on mango, maybe it’s just weak but the VG peeks through, also just a smidge floral but not overwhelming at all (possibly expected even)\n\n**Throat hit**: Smooth, almost nothing.\n\n**Uses**: This can pair with many fruits to provide nice mango top notes, IMO it’s weaker so I’d start at 3% as an accent in mixes and maybe go up to 6-8% as a mango base. TBH, I would start somewhere else if you’re looking for mango, I’d give this one a 70/100.  I don’t think I would pair this with creams as it would probably get lost. \n\nAs of now the only other mango I have is INW. This doesn’t work well with INW, they’re both a bit floral so not a great mix. I’d pair this with a more sweet nectar / meaty mango flavor like CAP sweet mango, TFA Philippine mango, or HS mango.\n\n**Pairings**: Most fruits, other mangos. Maybe cream but I haven’t tried. \n\n**Notes**: Works as a shake and vape doesn’t change much, I actually had an older bottle and I mixed it again to make sure but the older bottle (maybe 2 months) didn’t taste much different. Again, I’d look to another concentrate for mango stuff but this one worked nicely for me with strawberry and pineapple and a little EM. Have not messed too much with it but I will give it another try after I pick up some other mango flavors to mix it with. \n\nIf this were anything I’d say it’s a mango juice or maybe the flavor of like a mango slushy, just not as sweet. Lacks any real meat to it.\n\nMight get the job done in certain mixes.\n\n**Second Opinions**\n\n[Good reviews on ECX,  one touted it as a strong and true mango flavor, maybe they used it at a higher % or maybe I’m broken]( http://www.ecigexpress.com/diy-e-liquid/diy-e-liquid-flavors/flavor-west/flavor-west-naturals/natural-mango-by-flavor-west.html#review-list)\n\n\n[Some notes on ELR one saying “natural, but not fleshy; little sweet”]( http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/25461)\n\nedit: grammar, % used\n\n[FW site says natural citrus flavorings will vary from batch to batch](http://m.flavorwest.com/item/333232)","author":"HashSlingingSlashur","title":"Mango","url":"https://redd.it/5vtm01","vendor":{"name":"Flavor West","code":"FW"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FW","title":"Mango"}},
