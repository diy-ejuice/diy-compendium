Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Brie Cheese @ 3%, 70/30 VG/PG, Steeped 2 weeks.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Moderately dense. Really light subtle flavor, actually.  Some light aged cheese rind flavor.  Maybe a bit of smooth slightly sour cream.  The smell of the lingering cloud is definitely cheesy, but I'm not getting much from the actual vape.  Maybe a hint of mustiness.\n\n**Off-flavors:** You're vaping brie.  So none that you wouldn't expect.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  0/10.  None that I can find.\n\n**Uses:**  Sour cream frosting if you add sweetness.  Your own vapable cheese plate.  I can't believe I'm typing this, but adding some yogurt if you want a funkier cheese flavor.\n\n**Pairings:**  Green Apples, Bright pears, Plums, Figs, Grapes, drier bakery bases like FA Cookie and INW Biscuit. \n\n**Notes:** I was expecting calamity.  Sheer terror, now in vape form. I didn't get that. I actually don't get a strong flavor at all. I've vaped through my entire 20ml tester and I'm digging this.  I even went back and just tried the back of the hand test with the concentrate thinking I had fucked up my tester labeling and I'm still not getting the pungent notes I was expecting.  I even switched to my testing base for a 3% mix that I had sitting around and confirmed that there definitely is a concentrate in there.  Moving up to 80w/500F and I'm still not getting anything offensive. Hell, just tried a shake n' vape at 3% and the same kind of vibe, but a sort of a chemical mess.  Switched atomizers to a Troll with a single stapled fused clapton and It's not giving me rancid or particulary cheesy, both with the aged sample and a 5ml S&V at starting at 1 drop and moving up.\n\nI've tried clearing my palette a half dozen ways with fresh wicks and It just doesn't strike me as particularly assertive or weird.  Maybe this a function of the steep, but this is downright pleasant, as I'm not a huge fan of yogurt vapes, and I was expecting that assertive almost rancid vibe you get from FA Yogurt.\n\nI have three possible theories:\n\n1)My taste buds are completely shot or I can't taste something in this flavor.\n\n2)I got a bad batch of concentrate, although I ordered directly from Flavorah and not a re-bottler.\n\n3)This is actually pretty subtle, and kind of good.\n\nI'll leave it to second opinions to figure out which one of these is right.\n\nI'm 100% ready to admit that I'm wrong here, but I ain't mad at it.  I would wait for a some second opinions before ordering this, because I'm mystified.\n\n[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)\n\nEDIT: I came back to this one.  I was thinking my taste buds were at least partially shot, and I was right.  A day later, after literally sucking on lemons for a while, this is stronger than I initially though.  The flavor isn't as subtle as I initially tasted.  The cheese rind flavor is definitely there.  Here is the thing though, I don't find it rancid at all, which was my big concern.  I'm still a fan, but yeah, the parmesan is there.  What isn't there is that butryic acid clusterfuck that you get in some yogurts and DX flavors.  So, less subtle, but it's a pretty decent slightly aged creamy cheese flavor.  I don't think it would change my use of the flavor substantially.  I'd like to apologize for being relatively hasty on this.","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Brie Cheese","url":"https://redd.it/5c328a","vendor":{"name":"Flavorah","code":"FLV"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FLV","title":"Brie Cheese"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
