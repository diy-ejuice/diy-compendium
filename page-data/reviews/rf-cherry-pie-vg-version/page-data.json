There seems to be a very tiny bit of a vanilla note as well. The cherry part is reminiscent of the cherry pie filling I ate out of a can as a kid.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Rather harsh spice that I cannot quite explain.  It's a very subtle taste, but could potentially irritate a sensitive throat.  \n\n**Throat hit:** surprisingly strong 8/10. \n\n**Uses:**  Dessert recipes.  Decent standalone flavor as well.\n\n**Pairings:** Ice cream, whipped cream, sweet and light fruits, maybe a little graham cracker if you find the crust part isn't quite enough. \n\n**Notes:** Rather muted at a lower %.  Being a VG based flavoring, it will take a bit more steep time to fully develop depth, and also requires a higher than normal % to really shine.\n\nEDIT:  I just blended this with some 1% TFA Cheesecake Graham Crust, and it totally loses the throat hit.  Only problem is that it mutes the cherry taste.  I think a light cream at a very low % could potentially tame the harshness of this flavor.\n\nEDIT: [Link to all of our flavor reviews in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)","author":"wh1skeyk1ng","title":"Cherry Pie VG Version","url":"https://redd.it/4oggzn","vendor":{"name":"Real Flavors","code":"RF"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"RF","title":"Cherry Pie VG Version"}},
