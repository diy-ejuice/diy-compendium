Moderate throat hit.                      \n \n**Flavor Properties**- Raw coconut with out the natural sweetness or sugars found in coconut.\n\n**Relatable Flavors** - Something like chewing on a raw piece of coconut husk and all.\n\n**Off Flavors** - Extremely Floral and as mentioned before a little husky. ( I'm sure I'll get told I'm testing at too high of a % going to try it at 1.25 )\n\n**Position In The Recipe** - Should make a decent accent, or top note or pair with a sweeter coconut like Flavor Arts should round out for a very realistic coconut.\n\n**Pairings** - Other coconuts, chocolates, fruits, tobacco's, and given its extremely Floral taste I'm thinking a few tea flavorings would work really well.","author":"Chrisdvr1","title":"Coconut","url":"https://redd.it/4nxi7m","vendor":{"name":"Hangsen","code":"HS"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"HS","title":"Coconut"}},
