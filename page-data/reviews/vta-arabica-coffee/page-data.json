Introduction into bakery, candy and even desserts will be screaming for the use of VTA Arabic Coffee.\" They suggest MIXED: 3-5% SOLO: 5-9%.\n\n**Notes:** This tasted pretty full flavored to me at 3% I seen no need to push it to 5 or 9% like VT suggests. When freshly mixed it had a slight chemical like note with some faint musky coffee in the back ground. After it steeped for 14 days. On the nose it smells like the coffee filter after you brewed the coffee. When vaped it seems gritty like campfire/cowboy coffee. Does leave a lingering coffee taste in your mouth. A slight musky note is in there as well. \n\n**Pairings:** Hazelnuts, Chocolates, Creams, Tobaccos, & Bakeries. This would go really well with VT Coffee with Milk Froth. \n","author":"ebc88","title":"Arabica Coffee","url":"https://redd.it/8fs3ks","vendor":{"name":"Vape Train Australia","code":"VTA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"VTA","title":"Arabica Coffee"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
