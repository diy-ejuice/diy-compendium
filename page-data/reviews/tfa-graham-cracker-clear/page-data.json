It is dry and crispy without too much honey flavor. Not as buttery as biscuit but does have richness to it. Probably one of the more generic graham crackers out there. It does have an underlying sweetness to it that doesn't get in the way of any other flavor you mix this with\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Not a one\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Just a little throaty due to the dryness of this flavor, nothing overbearing by any means and when thrown into a mix gets diminished very fast\n\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  The obvious usage would be as a crust in cheesecakes but it is also good to add some depth and richness to cookies or I even like to add just a touch to creams to add body. If you are doing a tart or other bakery this plays really well with inw or jf biscuit for a crust also. It is very grainy and a bit nutty and can be used to add maltiness to milkshakes or even in a granola mix.\n\n\n**Notes:**\nThis is such a versatile staple to have in your arsenal. It is used quite a bit in a lot of situations. I am glad I single flavor tested this because, while common, I didn't actually know what it was bringing to the table\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[ELR Notes](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/7088) are basically all copies of the same note which talks more about how it is a good supporting flavor but isn't complex enough to stand on its own.\n\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**\n\nIf you have different opinions on the flavor or any ideas on how to use it please post them in the comments.
