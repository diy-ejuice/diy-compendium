Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Cream and Cookies @ 1% and 1 drop per 10ml, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 12 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Flavorah pitches this as a cookies and cream ice cream, but not I'm not getting much in the way of ice cream here. Tastes a whole lot like a less rich version of the non-dairy hydrogenated shortening type filling in oreos, with that chocolate-esque oreo kind of cookie taste.  No real richness or dairy in there to truly come across as an ice cream though.  Reasonably accurate flavor overall, but I'm missing mouthfeel. Not the ultra-concentrated kind of Flavorah, suggested usage between 1.5 and 3%.\n\nInhale has that dry, semi-sweet kind of oreo chocolate taste higher up.  Moderately dense, without a lot of thicker body, but a bit of a hollow ice cream taste down low.  Exhale has that same, fairly accurate oreo chocolate cookie / animal cracker type of flavor up front. Flavor is okay, but there's no real grainy texture there. Back of the exhale has some of that creme taste.  Again, taste is fairly accurate, but I'm not getting much mouthfeel or accurate fattyness to it.  Lingering higher slightly flat cocoa notes.\n \n**Off-flavors:** Balance is an issue depending on percentage, but nothing that shouldn't be there.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Nah. \n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  A fairly distinctive flavor that's going to need some help to get where it's going. To go full oreo, you'll probably need a crispier bakery like INW/JF Biscuit or FA Cookie to get some grain back into that cookie. Then you'll probably need a richer, thicker frosting concentrate to fill in creme note like FLV Frosting or maybe one of the whipped creams.\n\nThe lack of texture is probably an asset in something like a Cookies and Cream Ice Cream flavor.  Using this at 2% and above, then adding your ice cream base of choice will probably get you in the ballpark.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, I don't get a whole lot out of this at .25% and .5%.  A trace of a chocolate flavor, and a flat frosting note.  !% has slightly more definition, but still kind of tastes like oreo cookie ice milk, all homogeneous and lacking richness. 1.5% is better, you can start picking out some discrete cookie and frosting flavors but it's still on the light side.  2% is pretty linear with 1.5%, same kind of vibe, just a bit fuller flavor, still lacking richness. 3% has a pretty defined cookie flavor, if not texture. Chocolate here is reading as distinctly oreo, and you get full creme flavor without the body I'd expect.  At 4% that chocolate seems a bit blown out and weird, and there is still the same lack of body.  I'd recommend starting with this at 1.5% as an accent and going up to 2.5% or 3% as a primary flavor.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nI can't find much.\n\n[Heres the Flavorah product page.  Their description: \"Cream and cookies is a milky, ice cream with black oreo and white fudge filling. Can be fortified with other dairy flavors or used selectively as a base. This is not a vanilla cream, so it will not wash out other flavors as much with a vanilla note, but rather it will work with other dry cookie, dairy or sweet and frosting flavors.\"](http://store.flavorah.com/concentrated-cream-and-cookies-flavor)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Cream and Cookies","url":"https://redd.it/66xdc8","vendor":{"name":"Flavorah","code":"FLV"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FLV","title":"Cream and Cookies"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
