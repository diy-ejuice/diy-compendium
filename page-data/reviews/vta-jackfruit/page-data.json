It instantly made me gag. What the flying fuck is that stench! I really wanted to discard it, I don't know what made me say \"yeah this sounds interesting and there aren't any reviews might as well give it a shot, who knows I might be the first person in the world to try it\" and I hope I am because this smell should be banned. \n\nNow honestly, jackfruit when ripened/cooked doesn't smell nice too. It smells like shit. But this is concentrated, focused on bringing down your self esteem and making you give a pig a rimjob. It's not good at all. \n\nI learned a while ago not to judge by smell however. It's a bit like with some eastern cuisine, it might smell absurd and horrid to a person who doesn't know what's coming, but once you have it in your mouth you're absolutely in awe at how amazing it is. \n\nThis was quite the journey which almost made me puke and my stomach is still upside down when I think about my first toke of Jackfruit and how much it improved afterwards.\n\nTested on Falcon King, bamboo fiber, 75w M1+ coils yada yada.\n\n1% flavour, SNV, steeped a day, steeped 3 days, mixed.\n\nHonestly, it doesn't change with steeping, just the smell sort of goes in the background. Fancy!\n\nThe inhale is one of the best feelings I've had in my entire life. I don't know what those (definitely) crazy people over at VTA are doing but holy shit it's insanely good how well this feels to vape. It's a nice solid thick throat hit which sort of lingers in the upper back of your throat without itching or feeling uncomfortable. The inhale itself carries a nice, pleasant taste, very exotic, very comforting in a way. Think of how the aftertaste of the outside of a pineapple feels like aftertaste wise and you can sort of feel it. It's nice, subtle, sweet (even sweeter since I vape 80% vg), just all round super pleasant. My tongue was tingling in such a fascinating way it was almost magical. And the best part is how this feeling persevered during the slight steep I gave it. It never changed. \n\nThe exhale can go fuck itself though, it's literally like I'm giving reverse birth to a shit-smeared pig. It's horrendous. Imagine eating vegan pulled pork made with jackfruit instead of pig (it's a real thing and it's delicious) and puking it out, that's how it feels, fuck that exhale. It made me gag so many times but I needed to persevere in order to provide information to the community which gave me so much.\n\nThere's an additional review over at Chef's Flavours [here](https://chefsflavours.co.uk/blog/jack-fruit-vta-flavour-notes/). Shame that whoever wrote it didn't proceed to mix it up with some other flavours because this is where this flavours shine. \n\nYou NEED something to fix the exhale's sharp notes. I personally used CAP Double Apple at 4% but any apple/kiwi or anything with a dominant sharp note will fix it. And holy shit it's absolutely amazing. Think of VTA's Jackfruit as if it's that one awesome postman, the perfect delivery man who knocks on your door/rings the bell and waits patiently for you, smiles at you despite you being 2-3 mins late to the door still in your pjs and messy hair and wishes you an amazing day. It is thick, it is perfectly juicy without any super thick and syrupy feelings (looking at you INW Cactus SNV), it's just amazing. And now that the high notes of the exhale are covered by the apple (or whatever you prefer to fix those notes) it's absolutely genius. \n\nI went through a good 30ml in one day just like that, it's addicting. I'd recommend pairing it either with sharper notes for thickness and juiciness and that amazing inhale, or going with some not so juicy exotic tastes (INW Pineapple comes to mind). Hell, you can even go further with a succulent pulled pork recipe if that's what you fancy with some cinnamon and mango. There are just so many options once you adjust that exhale note that it's crazy. \n\nI wouldn't vape it as a standalone tho. Absolutely not. That exhale is gag inducing on its own and the smell is absurdly bad as expected from a ripened fruit like this one. But hot damn is this amazing. Great job VTA.\n\nP.S: Recommend it at 0.5% for less intense/dominant fruits, 1% for sharper more sour fruits\n\nP.P.S: [The recipe I used to make it awesome](https://e-liquid-recipes.com/recipe/3381942/Apples+and+pig%2527s+ass)","author":"RoninVX","title":"Jackfruit","url":"https://redd.it/e98k62","vendor":{"name":"Vape Train Australia","code":"VTA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"VTA","title":"Jackfruit"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
