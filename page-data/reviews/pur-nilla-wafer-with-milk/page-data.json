Definitely getting the milk from this with a vanilla malt back note. I'm not getting vanilla wafer from it at this percentage. I am getting a slightly sweet, mildly creamy milk with a faint hint of cookie dipped in milk. Nice body and fullness in the mouth feel as well. Also similar to the milk left in the bowl after eating cereal. I will have to try this out at a higher percentage to see if the Vanilla Wafer flavor comes out more. Very interesting malty flavor that I think will be very versatile in adding different things to a recipe depending on what you mix it with.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:** Malt?\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit:** 1/10\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Pairings:** Shakes, cookies, cakes, cereal, creams, custards, nuts, tobaccos, pudding, toffee, coffee.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Notes:** This is not a SF for me, probably 1.5-6% in blends.","author":"mysticrosell","title":"Nilla Wafer with Milk","url":"https://redd.it/5mx5lf","vendor":{"name":"Purilum","code":"PUR"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"PUR","title":"Nilla Wafer with Milk"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
