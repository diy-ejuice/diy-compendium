Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Passion Fruit @ 3%, 70/30 VG/PG, Steeped 10 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** A dryer passion fruit syrup. Not juicy or bright.  Almost a muted richness and some minor hints of an earthy peel type flavor.\n\n**Off-flavors:** I think the peel part of it is interesting, but if you weren't looking for that it counts as an off flavor.  It's subtle though.\n\n**Throat Hit:** 7/10. Relatively harsh for how muted the flavor is.\n\n**Uses:**  The relative dryness of this concentrate may be an asset.  It would work as unobtrusive background noise for a tropical flavor.  A small addition to CAP Passion Fruit would probably round out the bottom end of a passion fruit. \n\n**Pairings:**  Guava, Mango, Pineapple, Cherimoya, Guanabana... basically anything tropical. Would add an interesting note for a brighter fruit like cherry, raspberry, or strawberry.\n\n**Notes:**  Kind of reminds me of a lighter version of TFA Mango.  It's a slightly earthy duller flavor. It kind of felt like my wicks weren't broken in even after dripping 15ml of it.  I like it more than FA Passion Fruit, if only because it doesn't have some of the medicinal, perfumy notes and it seems more forgiving.  CAP Passion Fruit is still my favorite for a juicy passion fruit.  I'm not going to call it useless, but It it isn't a main note and It isn't a fantastic backup either.
