Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FA Guava @ .25% and %2, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 30 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  @ 2%, like vaping Right Guard. Intensely musky. A warm floral, actually kind of tastes like sandwalwood.  @.25% not a whole lot better. Same kind of warm musky notes, but I can maybe taste some juicy guava underneath there. There is a pretty subtle warm sweetness in there, but that top musk note sure is distracting.\n\n**Off-flavors:** This tastes nothing like a fruit, guava or otherwise.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Not really I guess?\n\n**Uses & Pairings:** None. There is none. Don't screw with me here...\n\nOr maybe, I guess, used at a super low percentage the musk note here isn't too super aggressive. It kind of reminds me of the slight musk you get off a green papaya salad.  It may have a niche role if you want to well and truly nail a melon vape that kind of feels like eating, or at least having your face buried in. the rind.  I'd use this about as low as you can measure for that. Like .05%, so it might be dilution time if you're dead set on capturing that melon musk.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nYes virginia, it really is that gnarly. It's an interesting kind of gnarly... so that's something. It's probably the first concentrate I've had that reads this musky. It's like a cologne flavor, as weird as that is.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[The FA apologist, HIC:](http://mamajsflavorshop.com/headinclouds-my-notes-on-flavor-descriptions/)\n\n\"This seems especially strong to me, with an aromatic (ok, floral) effect that permeates other flavors. When you drink the original “red” Hawaiian Punch, there is a distinctive aromatic flavor as you finish a sip - that’s this flavor. I think it’s best used as the only aromatic touch in a blend of tropical fruits - and then at <1%.\"\n\n[Theres some talk here about using this to include some skin or pith on a fruit](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/42424d/fa_guava/)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)** ","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Guava","url":"https://redd.it/5t2fuw","vendor":{"name":"Flavour Art","code":"FA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FA","title":"Guava"}},
