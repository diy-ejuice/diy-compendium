Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** CAP Cinnamon Danish Swirl v1 @ 4%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 27 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Tastes like a slightly sour flat snickerdoodle. I don't get a lot of richness or butter here, but that may be an issue with me not picking up whatever capella uses for butter. Definite bakery cinnamon.  Some dry bready notes here.  No yeast or richness, but a fluffy dryness.\n\nInhale is moderately dense, sour bakery cinnamon.  Fluffy but not rich. That cinnamon stays with you on the exhale, losing most of the sour character. Fluffy grainy exhale. I get a thin icing flavor towards the end of the exhale, with a bit of lingering sourness.  I'm saying sour at lot, but it's manageable here.  Some extra cream or butter should take care of most of it.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Slightly sour, especially at lower temperatures.  I think it's the cinnamon here.  I catch the same thing off of CAP Graham Cracker.  Sourness eases up as you increase power.  I get in mostly on the inhale and the very tail end of the exhale.  FA Fuji, a common pairing seems to amplify the sourness overall.  If you're getting an extra sour harshness, try cranking your wattage or temperature up a bit.\n\n**Throat Hit:** 4/10. Really smooth for being cinnamon heavy.  What gets you is the overall dryness.\n\n**Uses:** Pastry and desert style bases.  Cinnamon can be used for ciders. Tobacco enhancement.  Check out the winners of the first round of the mixxed contest if you need some inspiration.\n\n**Pairings:** Apple, Strawberry, Blueberry, Bananas, Creams, Tobaccos, Butter, Frosting. Probably a whole lot more depending on who you ask.  I will say this doesn't seem to work well with acidic fruits like a realistic pineapple.  I also don't see this working with harsh citrus or floral fruits like most peaches. Marshmallow can help with the dryness.\n\n**Notes:**  Lots and lots of use on this one, no actual flavor review.  So this was an attempt to remedy that.  Attempt being key here.\n\nS&V concentration tasting, this plenty recognizable at 1%.  If you're layering in other bakery flavors, start here.  The cinnamon and dryness just scales up from there.  2.5%-3% gives you a pretty recognizeable bakery base and anything above that seems to just get too dry and the sourness on the cinnamon gets weird.\n\nIf you're planning on using this for a bakery, you've got to address that dryness somehow, either with a more buttery bakery like INW Biscuit, or just some kind of additive for richness like CAP Vanilla Custard v1.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Some discussion of the off-flavors and usage](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/42pqt5/capella_cinnamon_danish_swirl/)\n\n[Seriously, the mixxed competition has brought out almost every possible use of this concentrate.
