Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Green Apple @ 1% and 1 drop per 10ml, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 8 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Tart and sweet green apple, leans a bit toward candy but not straight jolly ranchers. Dense apple body, with a fair amount of juiciness depending on percentage.  Moderately harsh and sharp.  Use at around .5% for an accent and closer to 2% for a primary flavor.\n\nInhale is a bit sharp and tart, with higher green, slightly acetone candy notes and a deeper juicy base.  Moderately dense, and on the sweet side. Exhale has green apple up front, somewhere between jolly ranchers and a crisper, tart realistic green apple. Top notes are a bit grassy, and have a touch of that same acetone off flavor. Sweeter full base.  Exhale feels a bit dryer and fuller than inhale, but I'm missing a bit of the juiciness that you get on the inhale. Flavor feels just a bit disjointed, like the more aggressive top notes aren't quite meshing into the base. Moderate amount of harshness.  Lingering sticky mouthfeel and some higher, astringent parts of the top notes.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Acetone and grassy notes in the top notes, but that seems pretty par for the course for green apples. At higher percentages, I'm getting a bit of a dairy funk in the base.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Pretty harsh as a S&V, seems to die down a bit with a steep.  Still ends up moderately harsh.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Pretty standard green apple flavor. Leans a bit toward candy, so it'll probably be good to mix with sweeter, fuller fruit flavors for a candy spin on a fruit mix.  If you want to keep a fruit mix brighter and fresher, use this a lower accent instead of a primary flavor.\n\nA bit sharp for cream mixes, but it can probably be done with a heavier cream or custard base.  This is going to push around lighter creams.\n\nGood, sharper accent for juicier apple flavors.\n  \n**Notes:**\n\nConcentration testing, .25% doesn't feel like a full flavor. Higher sour, tart notes come through pretty clearly but there isn't much of a base to it. .5% is actually pretty good, that base apple flavor is coming through a bit clearer. Not super aggressive and full down that low, but pretty well balanced.  1% is mostly sweeter than .5%, Tarter, sweeter, and those top notes are getting fairly aggressive.  1.5% is a bit rounder and sweeter than 1%. Tartness seems to be dying back down a bit, but i'm getting some clearer, sharp acetone and grassy flavors in the top notes. Sweetness is getting a bit juicy again.  2% is fuller, and juicier, but I'm getting some yogurt tang in there. 3% seems like too much on this flavor, getting a bit bitter and chemical.  Percentage recommendations are going to be based on how up front you want this flavor. Seems like it works as a pretty solid accent at .5%, and a fuller up front green apple with a candy edge at 1.75-2.25%.\n\nWill FLV Granny Smith be a crisp, realistic green apple? The suspense...\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[My only friend, the deleted user:](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/311eab/my_flv_tasting_notes_green_apple/)\n\n\"More apple juice than fresh apple. Subtle sour apple notes. Juicy â€” stimulates salivation (again - is that slight acidity??). A lot of ester-y fruitiness on the front of the tongue but not big in your face apple flavor. Well-balanced with no odd flavors.\n\nVery pretty with a drop of spearmint as a bright, simple ADV. Try as a carrier fruit flavor under more volatile fruit flavors. Try in delicate mixes. Try in ciders. Try with dry tobacco flavors.\"\n\n[ELR Page page is a little thin, but a couple useful notes on there.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/33045)\n\n[/u/skiddlzninja/ included some notes on recipe post in a FOTW for Apple:](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/3oi0dx/flavor_of_the_week_apple/)\n\n\"FLV Green Apple is more like the caramel apple lollipops that are handed out for Halloween, and seem to have a shelf-life that makes one feel uncomfortable just sharing the same spot in the universe as them. A delicious candy, and an unsettling anomaly. Nonetheless, it's a great tart candy-like apple flavor, and I'm using it here to gear Fuji closer towards a Granny Smith apple.\"\n\n[u/cannibalcastaway/ included a short note in a post of FLV tastings:](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/3qlxx6/a_few_flavorah_tasting_notes/)\n\n\"Green Apple - I had really high hopes for this, but since I am accustomed to the fantastic FA Fuji Apple, I shoudlnt be suprised that this didnt measure up. I do add 1% of it to the mix in my Sour apple Gummi bear recipe, which has become very popular among my circle of friends and juice-dependent associates.\"\n\n[Heres the Flavorah product page.  Their description: \"A familiar apple flavor. This is a crisp and aromatic candy apple, not the caramel apple type. This flavor blends well with other soft fruit flavors, like banana and cantaloupe. It is also a good fruit flavor along with menthol, custard, or tobacco.\"](http://store.flavorah.com/concentrated-green-apple-flavor)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**\n\n**[Suggestions for reviews?
