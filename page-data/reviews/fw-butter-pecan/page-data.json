Heavy on the tongue, with no throat hit.   \n\n**Flavor Properties**- Rich butter with a hint of cream, and a great pecan aftertaste.\n\n**Relatable Flavors** - As if you took movie theater butter and covered toasted pecans.\n\n**Off Flavors** - Slightly chalky.\n\n**Position in the recipe** - This is going to be a very versatile flavor should work well as a top note, and base, and at lower % an accent.              \n      \n**Pairings** - Versatility is the key word here. Should work with most creams, bakeries , other nuts, chocolates, and most fruits. The only thing I would avoid  is citrus fruit flavorings, such as pineapple, and lemon-lime.","author":"Chrisdvr1","title":"Butter Pecan","url":"https://redd.it/4lts82","vendor":{"name":"Flavor West","code":"FW"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FW","title":"Butter Pecan"}},
