I get some prune notes from it off the top instead of raisin. It's more if the muskiness of a prune than the sweetness of a raisin. On the back end there is a kind of sweet anise candy thing going on. Very much hitting the black licorice candy button. \n\n**Off flavors:** Anise? That sweet anise candy thing that's going on? It's not unpleasant, it's just not supposed to be here. \n\n**Throat hit:** None at all really at this percentage. It's very smooth. \n\n**Pairings:** This may do really well as an element in a cocktail that needs that anise note. I could see this adding a much needed layer to whiskey or dark rum concentrates. It might also be what you're looking for if you are looking for a weak black licorice note. I did some quick recipes with different tobaccos and it pairs very well with the Inawera For Pipe Concentrates. It's not very up front it just gives a bit more complexity to the tobacco at 1.5%.\n\n**Quick recipe:**\nDank Bowl\n- INW Black for Pipe 2.5%\n- TFA Raisin 1.5%\n- FA Caramel .75%\n\n**Conclusion:** I eat raisins at least once a week and this is not them. It will however be useful to layer into tobaccos, booze and darker fruits to get more complexity and that \"certain something\". I like what it brings to darker tobaccos a lot. BTW when I ordered all I could get was a 30ml =D. If a couple of other flavor reviewers would like a little so we can get some decent second opinions please message me and we'll see about getting you some to test. \n\n**Second opinions:**There's not a lot out there.\n\n- ELR - [57Ghia notes] (http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/1731) \"Prune/Plum w/a Grape Candy Aftertaste\", others with the same notes confirming that low percentages work well with tobaccos. \n\n- ECX reviews - [one review] (http://www.ecigexpress.com/shop/diy-e-liquid/diy-e-liquid-flavors/signature-flavors/signature-sweet-flavors/raisin-flavor-signature.html) from fishdude that notes \"Not sure this flavor tastes like raisin exactly, but id does approximate it. It was fruitier than I expected based on the smell. I think it could really work well as a complementary note in tobacco mixes. I had read that this flavor is really strong, so I diluted 1 parts Raisin to 2 parts PG (or vg). I used the diluted raisn mix at a couple drops per 10 mL in a pipe tobacco recipe using ECX's Captain with a little Black Mile and Signature French Vanilla. Its like huffing a freshly opened bag of vanilla cavendish. Tobacco enthusiasts should add raisin to their arsenal today!\"\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews] (https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"kindground","title":"Raisin","url":"https://redd.it/60iqhx","vendor":{"name":"The Flavor Apprentice","code":"TFA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"TFA","title":"Raisin"}},
