It is sweet and can definitely taste the granules of sugar in the dough. This flavor has a nice thick mouth feel. It even has a greasy note to it that packaged cookie dough has.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  If you count the grease, but I think it adds to the authenticity of the cookie dough\n\n**Throat Hit:**  This flavor is moderately harsh on its own.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I can see this flavor being used to thicken up some mixes as it has a very nice full mouth feel. I would also use this with sugar cookies for a \"wetter\" note.\n\n**Notes:**\nAt 1% I get a very full flavor, I would maybe go as hi as 1.5% but nothing higher. I've seen this flavor being used at 3% with bad reviews and I would even use this at .5% to enhance other mixes. \n\n\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**\n\nIf you have different opinions on the flavor or any ideas on how to use it please post them in the comments.
