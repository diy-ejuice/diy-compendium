Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FW Reindeer Poop, 2 and 4%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 9 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Flavorwest describes this as \"Warm Cinnamon Roll Topped with Vanilla Ice Cream and Chocolate Syrup Flavor.\" Why is it called reindeer poop? Googling for said reindeer poop points to chocolate covered peanuts.  It is a mystery.  This basically tastes like a softer chocolate cinnamon roll.  The vanilla ice cream component of this ends up making the drier cinnamon roll base taste a little softer and a bit richer, but not really doughy.  Bakery cinnamon is pretty similar to straight FW Cinnamon Roll and actually pretty well balanced without drying out the vape.  Chocolate is interesting, I'm not getting a discrete layered kind of chocolate syrup.  Tastes more like their was some sort of cocoa powder in the actual cinnamon roll dough.  The flavor description makes it sound layered, but it's all kind of a big lump of flavor. It's all fairly well executed and not a bad solo flavor, but I'm sort of at loss about what to do with because there is already quite a bit going on here. Seems to need about 6% to get going.\n\nInhale has some pretty solid AP type of vaguely acidic bite to it, which is odd because I don't get much distinct breadiness through the entire vape. Some building chocolate and cinnamon underneath that.  On the sweet side, but not too cloying for a cinnamon roll.  Exhale has bakery cinnamon up front, with some higher cocoa note. Medium dense but softer cinnamon roll body without any real bready or yeasty notes but still a bit of grainy texture. Tail end of the exhale is mostly a light vanilla and a heavier chocolate. No real frosting or topping that I can tell. Just kind of an amorphous (but pretty good) wad of chocolate cinnamon roll.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Inhale is a bit odd overall. No real off flavors on the exhale, but it doesn't seem layered in the way that the description would make you think.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Not a lot on the exhale, but this has a sharp inhale like overflavoring with AP. No heavy corn-chipish flavor like I'd expect with that level of sharpness, but it's still a bit odd.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Again, I'm not even sure. It's pretty busy and full already.  It's not a bad bakery base if you need both chocolate and cinnamon for something. I could see maybe adding some softer caramel or nut flavors to this, but it's a pretty distinct chocolate cinnamon roll.  Maybe add some tobacco?\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, 2% seems like mostly bakery cinnamon and texture without much other flavor. 4% has a clearer chocolate flavor shot through the entire vape. Cinnamon doesn't seem much heavier and the the texture feels a bit more like an actual baked good. 6% has a sharper inhale, chocolate feels a bit more filled out. Bakery cinnamon still feels pretty well in balance. Texture is still soft, but it has some actual flavor attached. The inhale at 8% feels a bit too sharp, chocolate has filled out nicely and is taking over any of the cinnamon roll underneath it. 10% has a really sharp inhale, probably a better with a long steep but feels almost too heavy on the chocolate.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[The ELR Page. One note from user \"SunnyD\": \"Used at 12% and got a cinnabon taste from the vape. Needs a cream to add a little to it. Very impressed with the taste on its own.\"](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/43877)\n\n[User \"Teresa P\" on VU says: \"I love reindeer poop! There, I said it, I have no shame....lol! It's sweet and bakery \"cinnamony\", but not like Caps cinnamon danish swirl. It's more sweet than rich, if that makes sense. If you like bakery vapes, you'll like it.\"](http://vapingunderground.com/threads/anyone-try-flavor-wests-reindeer-poop.204704/)\n\n[Moderate to positve reviews on BCF, an unknown user calls it \"Christmas in a bottle with Christmas sparkles flying out soon as you twist the top off.\"  Seems a bit odd, but okay.](http://www.bullcityflavors.com/reindeer-poop-fw/)\n\n[Largely positive reviews on ECX.
