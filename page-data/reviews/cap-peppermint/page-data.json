Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** CAP Peppermint @ 1% and 4%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 16 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** At 1%, not much of anything.  Don't use this at 1%.\n\nAt 4%, light mentholated inhale with building sweetness. Mentholation peaks in the inhale, exhale is mostly sweetness.  Some thicker, non-dairy creamy notes on the exhale. Really clean exhale.  Lingering peppermint flavor, if a bit flat. At 4% I'm left wanting more peppermint and more candy. Higher percentage S&V testing is pretty linear up to 10%.  Flat candy sweetness.  Nothing natural tasting here.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Nope.  Pretty sweet, but I'm taking this as a peppermint candy flavor.\n\n**Throat Hit:** 0/10.  Smooth as all hell.\n\n**Uses:** Candy peppermint.  Peppermint Patties, Milkshakes, Ice Creams.  I'm not a fan of peppermint with fruits, but the relative weakness of this concentrate would lend itself to easy mixing in those applications.\n\n**Pairings:** Vanilla, Chocolate, Creams. More aggressive mints. \n\n**Notes:**  Another fairly weak Capella flavor.  Nothing wrong with this one, per se.  Just surprisingly weak.  S&V tested all the way up to 10% and it's still not overbearingly minty or sweet. I'd mix all the way up at 6% and add extra menthol and sweetness.  Kind of defeats the purpose. Decent all in one candy cane up in the 10% range.\n\nCheck /u/thedirtyprojector/ 's [FA Peppermint review](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/5b9d95/fa_peppermint_flavourart_peppermint/).  Same kind of creamy candy notes, whole lot stronger.  I'd go that direction.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[/u/discchord/ tried TFA, FA, and CAP for a peppermint patty recipe. Goes with CAP Peppermint as relatively gentle.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/4d8f7b/marcie_easily_the_best_goddamn_peppermint_patty/)\n\n[ECF users find cap peppermint weaker than cool mint, but a better candy cane flavor.
