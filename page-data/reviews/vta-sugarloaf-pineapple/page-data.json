Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Vape Train Sugarloaf Pineapple, 3% and 7%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 14 days.\n**Flavor Description:**  Bright, tart pineapple with some candy sweetness.\n\nPretty straight ahead pineapple flavor.  Manages to capture the acidity of a fresh pineapple without being tropical battery acid like TPA Pineapple.  Fairly tart, but not overwhelmingly harsh or acidic.\nBrighter than something like pineapple juice, at least at higher percentages.  I do get a sort of flatter, sweeter candy base here, but the tartness really carries it and keeps this from tasting too much like white gummy bears.\n\nSome juicier texture here in the base, although not quite ripe pineapple juicy. Juicier than any pineapple concentrate I’ve tried with maybe the exception of CAP Golden Pineapple.   Moderately full texture but not really fleshy.  More of a dense, syrupy fullness and the higher sweetness level sells that in a bit harder. \n\nThis tastes quite a bit like a brighter, more saturated version of INW Pineapple to me.  At similar percentages, this feels sweeter and fuller than INW Pineapple, while still keeping a good balance between tartness and candy sweetness.\n\n**Off-Flavors:**  Not really.  Has just the tiniest hint of a sulfur note present in pretty much all pineapple concentrates I’ve tried.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Moderate to harsh, but it’s really not bad for a bright, tart flavor.  Maybe a bit harsher than INW Pineapple or CAP Golden Pineapple but nearly as harsh as TPA Pineapple.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 3%, this feels a bit flat.  I’m getting a slightly duller pineapple flavor with less tartness and acidity.  Feels a bit like a sort of mid-grade pineapple candy flavor or a pineapple juice.  Fuller than 5% INW Pineapple though.\n\nAt 7%,  this is a lot bigger and brighter.  Tart pineapple top notes on top of that candy sweet base.  Also feels a bit juicier.  Getting maybe a bit harsh, but pretty solid overall.\n\nVape Train suggests mixing with this at 2-5% and standalone from 5-9%.   That doesn’t seem that far off.   Just based on these tests, I’d start as an accent around 3% and use this closer to 6-8% as a primary flavor.  Just for laughs I mixed this up at 10% and it’s maybe a bit too acidic so I’d watch the high end on this.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This seems like a pretty good fit most of the places that you’d use pineapple.  Should work well in most fruit profiles, adding a good hit of sweetness and tartness to anything you throw at it.  Good, bright tropical flavor to accent mango, banana, coconut, or papaya.  Might get a bit harsh next to citrus though.   Should also work well in most fruit based beverage profiles.\n\nNothing here that wouldn’t work with creams, but it may come across a bit artificial.  Seems too bright for a more realistic cooked pineapple or canned pineapple usually used there.  In a similar vein, probably wouldn’t be my first choice for bakeries or other darker, layered profiles. \n\n**Second Opinions:**  Not a lot out there via the google.\n\n[Here is the product page from Vape Train.  Their description: “a sweet and juicy white fleshed pineapple. We’ve created this pineapple flavour for those e-juice recipes that need a sweeter and juicer type of pineapple. Great flavor as a mixer or even use it as a standalone.”](https://www.vapetrain.com.au/shop/vt-concentrates/sugarloaf-pineapple-flavour-concentrate-diy-for-e-juice-recipe/)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Sugarloaf Pineapple","url":"https://redd.it/8i4rl6","vendor":{"name":"Vape Train Australia","code":"VTA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"VTA","title":"Sugarloaf Pineapple"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
