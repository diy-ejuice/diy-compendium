Temp at 370Â°F, power at 140W.\n\n**Testing:** TFA Espresso @ 2.5%, steeped 12 days\n\n**Description:** Well this is not what I expected from an espresso flavoring. I thought it would be a very, very strong coffee almost to the point of being overpowering. However, like the curse of most coffee vape flavors, it doesn't really taste like coffee. Rather,  I almost get a taste reminiscent of mud with a few randomly placed coffee notes on the exhale.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Mud/dirt. Also a strong chemical note in any recipe I've mixed this in, down to 0.5% which only gets worse with steeping.\n\n**Throat hit:** 4/10, as expected with an espresso\n\n**Uses and pairings:** You could maybe use this in a bakery flavor as a coffee note but I wouldn't go above 0.25%. If you're interested in making a bleach flavored ejuice, this flavoring would be useful as a main note to capture that chemical bleach taste.\n\n**Notes:** I picked up a 10ml of this when I started mixing a few months ago. I have more than half of it left. This is by far the worst flavoring I've tried and it absolutely kills any recipe it is in. Unless you already have some, I would not recommend buying it. If there's anyone here who can actually make use of this flavoring, I am curious to know how because I find the chemical flavor so strong it's unbearable.\n","author":"182plus44","title":"Espresso","url":"https://redd.it/5xh8nj","vendor":{"name":"The Flavor Apprentice","code":"TFA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"TFA","title":"Espresso"}},
