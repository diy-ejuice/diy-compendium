I can't say it tastes like Coke or Pepsi, but it is reminiscent of some sort of dark cola.  Strangely, this flavor seems more \"bubbly\" than some champagne flavors I've tried.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  I'm getting a slight plastic taste, and the citrus note bothers me a bit simply because it seems like it shouldn't be there.\n\n**Throat hit:** 7/10\n\n**Uses:**  Due to it's nature, this flavor will play into a soda type of mix very well.  It could also be used to give a slight \"carbonated\" effect.  I would stay under 3% or it could get perfumey.\n\n**Pairings:**  Booze flavors (Rum seems to be very common), preferred fruits (FA Black Cherry seems to be the most popular), Koolada.\n\n**Notes:**   This is a clear flavoring and seems really nice on your coils.  As stated, I do taste a slight citrus note, but that may be due to how the flavor smells too. *I'm really on the fence about the nature of this flavor, so I'm hoping for some added input in the comments.*\n\nEDIT: [Link to all of our flavor reviews in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)","author":"wh1skeyk1ng","title":"Cola","url":"https://redd.it/59bs68","vendor":{"name":"Flavour Art","code":"FA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FA","title":"Cola"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
