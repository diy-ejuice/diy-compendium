A special blend that takes you straight to the top of all strawberries.   \n\n* **ACCURACY :** &nbsp; &#128308; &#128308; &#128308; &#128308; &#128308; &nbsp; EXACTLY LIKE THE DESCRIPTION  \n\n----------  \n**&#128313; Flavor Description &#128313;**  \nFresh of the shake it has an impressive smell. I would buy any Strawberry direct of the shelves smelling like that. It’s exactly the smell of strawberries when they’re fully juicy and don’t need to ripen anymore. A hint of sweetness is in the air.\n\nA strawberry in great standing, I taste a light sweetness. There’s a hint of the typical acidity which could also turn a little greenish. Realistic representation of a strawberry so far of the shake.\n\nAfter 3 days the sweetness is more coming through and I taste a fully bodied ripe strawberry without any off notes and the fruity acidity is mellowed in. The juiciness is exactly what I expect from a realistic strawberry.\n\nIs it the ultimate strawberry? I can't say, but it gained enough of my love to work a little bit more with strawberries in the future. It is for sure one of the better ones and can be easily used in recipes over 4%, where I like it most.  \n\n**&#128313; Comments &#128313;**  \nAt the moment I have only seen it at Flavorjungle.com and in 30 ml  (and bigger) size.\n\nThere have been discussions if this can be used by strawberry mutes, which I can't judge and I didn't read any confirmation. If you have tested it and were able to taste it as a strawberry mute, please leave a comment since this would bring this concentrate even more to the top of the list of strawberry flavors.","author":"Steve-TC","title":"Ultimate Strawberry","url":"https://redd.it/qj6ubl","vendor":{"name":"Jungle Flavors","code":"JF"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"JF","title":"Ultimate Strawberry"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
