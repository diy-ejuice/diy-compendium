Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** TPA Ruby Chocolate, 3% and 6%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 20 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Semi-sweet and dry chocolate with a slightly juicy raspberry fruitiness.\n\n[TPA calls this a \"A smooth chocolate taste with bursts of yummy fruitiness. Similar to the taste of those candy chocolate cherries.\"](https://shop.perfumersapprentice.com/p-8541-ruby-chocolate-flavor.aspx)  \n\nThis delivers on some of that fruitiness.  Actual fruit flavor in here tastes kind of close to Acai, but that may just be flavor association from the proximity to chocolate.  Indistinct berry fruitiness, I'd call it closer to raspberry than cherry but it's a bit difficult to nail down.  Tastes a bit vague but fairly realistic.  Not a heavier solid candy type flavor.  Lightly tart but nothing intense enough to come across as sour or as clashing with the chocolate.  Some moderate juiciness and vibrancy. Fruit feels like an accent here, sort of sitting in the base of the flavor, while the top seems more chocolatey.\n\nI get quite a bit of cocoa out of this.  Drier, semi-sweet type of chocolate flavor.  Nothing off about the chocolate, but it doesn't really have the creamy depth of a milk chocolate. Seems a bit dry but it doesn't do the tootsie roll thing that TPA Double Chocolate Clear does. Feels like a slightly less dark version of HS Australian Chocolate, more of a cocoa rather than a full chocolate.\n\n[So, ruby chocolate is apparently a thing (kind of awesome breakdown, btw).](https://thechocolatejournalist.com/ruby-chocolate/)  Based on the descriptions, it's basically pink and lightly fruity white chocolate without much of an actual cocoa taste.  Based on that description, I'd guess this is substantially off-profile.\n\nMandatory coil gore report is mostly positive.  Doesn't seem any harder on wicks than TPA Double Chocolate Clear. Starts to taste a bit flat and muted after a couple ml, but I haven't gotten anything that tastes like straight burnt chocolate solids.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  So, apparently not like actual ruby chocolate. Nothing really unpleasant though. Not a tootsie roll or bandaid type chocolate flavor.  Could use some more creaminess for a full chocolate.\n\n**Throat Hit:** I'm not getting anything harsh.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 3%, feels a lot like cocoa dusted raspberries. No real richness to the cocoa notes.  Solid tartness to the fruit underneath that cocoa. Mouthfeel is a little thin.\n\nAt 6% I'm getting more chocolate.  Still distinctly fruity but that chocolate fills in a bit and comes closer to actual chocolate.  Still needs some help to have the depth of an actual chocolate.  Still nothing off or really unpleasant.\n\nJust based on these tests, I'd probably use this around 6-8% as a primary note in a mix where that chocolate is going to be filled in.  I'd use around 2% as a lighter cocoa accent in a fruity profile.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Good base for flavors that need both berries and chocolate.  I don't think you'll be able to mix around either component and just use one.\n\nCherry cordials would work here, or a fruitier truffle type flavor.  Would probably need some supporting cream to add some depth and richness to the chocolate base. Alternatively would work well with some AP to make that chocolate a bit more solid and hit harder.\n\nAs is, would work well in an ice cream or maybe some specialty bakery profiles.\n\nGood backup flavor for FLV Acai to boost the cocoa notes already there.\n\n**Second Opinions:** None that I can find.\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Ruby Chocolate","url":"https://redd.it/7u0c1k","vendor":{"name":"The Flavor Apprentice","code":"TFA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"TFA","title":"Ruby Chocolate"}},
