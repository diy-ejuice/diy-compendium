Moderately dense for a bakery flavor I would give it 6 out of 10. Mouthfeel is a little dry.\n\n**Throat Hit** 4/10\n\n**Flavor Properties** \n\nA bready flavor with a significant maple flavoring, also getting some vanilla, and butter. Very sweet with a slightly Savory bitter note.\n\n**Relatable Flavors** \n\nFlavoring does remind me of waffles with a light maple syrup.\n\n**Position In The Recipe** \n\nThis flavoring is all over the place, the very sweet note is definitely coming through in the top position. Along with having a weird burnt butter and waffle flavoring that sits in the background. \n\nI don't see this being very useful as an accent. I think its primary use is going to be in the base, being aware that the sweet maple flavor is going to take the top notes.\n\n**Off Flavors**\n\nOkay here's the problem with the flavoring it taste like you're licking a hot iron, which I have never done but, we have all smelled  that  dry  hot iron smell and that is the flavor time getting. I get that burnt butter that I would associate with frying waffle batter but it is way too prominent.\n\nThe weird thing is the aftertaste is really good, after the exhale, and you let your palate rest for a minute. you get waffle covered in maple syrup. During the act of vaping this hot iron, burnt butter, flavor is coming through loud and strong.\n\n**Pairings** \n\nOther bakeries, fruits, berries, and Maybe tobacco's. Candy flavorings like caramel, and  butterscotch. Could also see vanilla working well. My feeling is it definitely needs some help maybe a little Joy, or AP could bring out the bread notes.\n\n**Notes** \n\nI believe this is an attempt at a single flavor mix, but IMHO it definitely needs a little help. This flavor could be a great addition, to a french toast, or waffle recipe. As a standalone it's lacking in bakery flavor. \n\n**Rating** 65/100\n\n**Please if your opinion differs, or you have another review for this flavor add it in the comments. This will help the master list with multiple reviews in one spot.**","author":"Chrisdvr1","title":"Waffle","url":"https://redd.it/58pnkw","vendor":{"name":"Flavor West","code":"FW"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FW","title":"Waffle"}},
