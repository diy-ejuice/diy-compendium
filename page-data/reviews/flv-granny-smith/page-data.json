Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Granny Smith @ 1% and 1 drop per 10ml, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 9 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  This tastes a lot like [FLV Green Apple](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/67rq50/flv_green_apple/) but a little less on the candy side, sweeter, a bit crisper, and a good bit harsher.  First part of the exhale is a pretty legitimate granny smith apple, but the inhale is a bit of a mess and the tail end of the exhale borders on straight unpleasant.  I'd relegate this accent duty, using it under .5% to add some realism and crispness to juicier, full apple or pear base.\n\nInhale is sharp and acidic with a sweeter but slightly dry green apple candy base. Moderately dense, with some top end bitterness and grassiness.  Beginning of the exhale is promising, with some crisper green apple peel notes and a even a bit of a denser, sweet fleshy texture. Back half of the exhale is pretty rough. Those top notes get bitter, astringent, and sharp and dominate the sweeter, dense candy apple base.  Bitterness really sticks on the top of your palate, and I'm getting a pretty prominent throat hit. Lingering bitterness and sticky, sugary mouthfeel.\n\n**Off-flavors:** This has a lot of that grassy, green apple acetone kind of taste. It dominates the back end of the exhale and you get a lingering bitterness.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  I get a pretty healthy throat hit from this.  It's definitely on the harsh side.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This is rough enough that I think it's pretty well relegated to a supporting player at low percentages.  I wouldn't want to try to turn this into a full apple flavor, I'd rather use this to accent a juicier apple concentrate.  Would work to sell a bartlett pear as well.  This definitely needs a fuller, juicier base to work from.\n  \n**Notes:**  .25% is bright, tart bordering on sour, and a bit crisp.  Not a lot of body to the concentrate down here, but a crisper texture and taste. .5% adds some sweetness to the back end, although it doesn't really taste like a full apple flavor.  Acetone notes are definitely present, but not completely overwhelming. 1% is sweeter and has a clearer apple taste and texture.  It's a good deal more bitter and harsh in the top notes.  1.5% is about as much sweetness as I want out of this.  Body is getting a bit dry for a fruit. Those off-flavors are still definitely in charge here.  2% is drier, even sweeter, and fairly astringent.  I don't think this is a good fit for a primary note. I'd recommend using .25-.5% pretty strictly as an additive to crisp up a fuller, flat, apple or pear based juice.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nI can't find anything relevant.\n\n[Heres the Flavorah product page.  Their description: \"Strong green apple, with candy apple volume. Vibrant apple skin notes and familiar hard candy appeals to either crisp real fruit apple blends, or something that is candy and green like a jolly rancher. A must have for getting the right apple pie or apple struddle.\"](http://store.flavorah.com/concentrated-granny-smith-flavor)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**\n\n**[Suggestions for reviews?
