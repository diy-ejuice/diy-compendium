Keeper!\n- This is one of those, \"omg, I taste tobacco!\" type flavors.\n- It reminds me of Black Note's Legato which is a NET made from Kentucky tobacco.\n- If you're a serious tobacco head, this NEEDS to be in your collection. Get it.","author":"T_Mace","title":"Black for Pipe","url":"https://redd.it/5rjoja","vendor":{"name":"Inawera","code":"INW"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"INW","title":"Black for Pipe"}},
