Very heavy on the tongue with no throat hit. I would give it a 9 out of 10 in density.      \n\n**Flavor Properties** -  Nice and creamy dairy, moderately eggy, very buttery without being greasy with a smooth Rich vanilla, and in my opinion the perfect level of sweetness.\n\n**Relatable Flavors** - If you ever made custard ice cream it's a lot like tasting the custard before you put it in the ice cream maker, or a  homemade vanilla pudding.\n\n**Off Flavors** - Just the lightest greasy flavor.\n\n**Position in the recipe** - Should work as an accent or in a base at low percentages. A strong flavor that should be able to take the top in any cream recipe.\n\n**Pairings** - The list is really endless here I have yet to find a flavor but doesn't work on some level with this flavoring.\n\nWorks well with creams, chocolates, fruits, bakeries, and savory flavors such as coffee I think I'm going to try it with a little bit of I anice fa for a creamy black licorice.","author":"Chrisdvr1","title":"Vanilla Custard V1","url":"https://redd.it/4l7jeg","vendor":{"name":"Capella","code":"CAP"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"CAP","title":"Vanilla Custard V1"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
