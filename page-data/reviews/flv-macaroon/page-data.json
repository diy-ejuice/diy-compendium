It actually does a great job of representing a MACAROON. The \"off\" flavor I was tasting I can now pinpoint as coconut. Sorry for any confusion!  \n*Summary*  \nKind of an odd flavoring. I feel like this is FLV's answer to \"Cookie.\" It's got a bit of texture, but not as much texture or dryness as you might expect from a macaroon or a cookie. I find it gets weird on me over 1.5% (~~almost smokey?~~ *EDIT: Coconut, maybe toasted coconut?*). Below that, it does provide a nice sort of nutty, cookie-like dryness to a recipe. It's definitely an accent. I single flavor tested this at 2% and am not a fan (~~not good, not bad~~ *EDIT: Good as a macaroon, bad as a macaron*), but I did enjoy how it accented certain aspects of mixes. Certainly not an end-all-be-all cookie, but it's an interesting nutty dry accent to bakeries or cookies. Kind of reminds me of a diluted INW Biscuit + FA Cookie. ~~I want to say I detect vanilla or something but it's such a mild tone it's hard to pick up on it~~ *EDIT: It's coconut*. \n\n**On the Nose**  \nDry, nutty, plastic or vanilla or something, having a tough time describing this aspect of the aroma (EDIT: It's coconut). \n\n**Recommended Usage**  \n*Stand alone*: 1.5%\n\n*In a mix*: <.5-1.25%\n\n**Throat**  \nNone; mild.\n\n**Pairings**  \nNuts, cookies, caramels, butterscotches, maybe tobacco *EDIT: Marshmallow is good too*\n\n**Avoid**  \nHard to say, I'd say leave it out of recipes that aren't \"bakery\"\n\n**Steep**  \n2-3 Days\n\n**Quick Recipe: Pecan Pie Filling**  \n*Ratio: 10PG/90VG*  \n*Steep: 3 days* \n\n* FLV Pralines @ 2.25%\n* FLV Macaroon @ 1.25%\n* FLV Vanilla Custard @ 1.5%\n* FLV Caramel @ 1% \n\nWhat this flavoring does really well here is accent the nuttiness of the pralines as well providing some texture to the pecans, and giving a sort of dry, cookie-like base ~~for a crust~~. You can see here it does bring some texture, but may need some help from other ingredients to bring a crust flavor/texture more forward if that's what you're looking for. \n\n*Please if your opinion differs, or you have another review for this post it in the comments. Will help the master list with multiple reviews in one spot.*","author":"CheebaSteeba","title":"Macaroon","url":"https://redd.it/4qelel","vendor":{"name":"Flavorah","code":"FLV"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FLV","title":"Macaroon"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
