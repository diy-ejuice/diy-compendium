All I get is an overwhelming sensation of dark sweetness with some hints of chocolate. At 7 days, it's more chocolate than tobacco. A dark chocolate more than anything else, I think it's safe to say I undershot this at 2%, at least by a percent or two. I tried one squonk full of this after vaping a chocolate cookie recipe and I almost couldnt tell them apart except for that I had lost the cookie part. Nothing too ground breaking here. This is the chocolate version of tobacco caramel that ry4 is or can be. I wouldn't run out and get this, myself as I'm not the most fond of chocolate flavored Tobaccos, but if you want that note, or even a tobacco sweetener, this could be the one for you.\n\n*Suggested percent:* 3+ main note i just dont see that being something I want per se, 1 - 2% accent.\n\n*Pairing ideas:* I'd probably want to use this for a musky chocolate note as part of something darker like a cigar styled mix. Or even as a part of an ry4 styled vape that had some AP/cookie or coffee notes. I dont know, maybe I'm just numb to the baccos so I guess I could say dessert tobaccos or even maybe just a simple mix of this and a custard? \n\n - SC Black Mile 3%\n - FLV Vanilla Tobacco 2%\n - Vanilla Ruyan Custard 2%\n\nand call it Blaccostard? Add 1.5% FLV Virginia for a bit of a drier blend. Just a guess...\n\n[Noted Review with u/ChemicalBurnVictim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QGyxqZz8Mw&t=501s)\n\n**Second Opinions**: \n\nELR user Leilani writes:\n> 2/2018 2/2018 Rin ♥️  \n> Formerly \"Black & Mild\"  \n  \"Some people say that Black Mile tastes like a popular blend of American pipe tobacco cigars. With their strong chocolate flavor and a hint of vanilla aroma, Black Mile comes on strong and goes away smooth, making it a great flavor to include in your DIY e-liquid for a relaxing after dinner vape.\" - http://www.ecigexpress.com  \nSuggested Usage Rate: WARNING: this tobacco flavor is highly concentrated. Start at 1%, and then adjust to taste.\n\nELR user Kinnikinnick:\n>This tobacco is in the black and mild pipe tobacco family; very satisfying dark tobacco with notes of caramel, dark chocolate and a touch of licorice (very faint). Primarily used as an adder tobacco when a chocolate note is needed, I find adding it in with cigar liquids quite nice. Tested at 5%, somewhat strong, reduce percentage when mixing with other tobaccos.  \nPreferred single flavor mix: 3.0%\n\n\nI dunno, this makes a lot of sense to me, actually. If it were rebranded from Black & Mild, I could see this as part of some imagined sweet cigar where the Black portion is a 'chocolate' sweet (if that's what the real thing tastes like, idk, never had one) but you'd still need the 'Mild' to finish it off. I would maybe recommend this for anyone who likes a chocolate note in their tobacco as a supporting flavor or to wet up dry tobaccos that could use some dark sweetness.","author":"isuamadog","title":"Black Mile","url":"https://redd.it/r2k9qt","vendor":{"name":"Super Concentrated","code":"SC"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"SC","title":"Black Mile"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
