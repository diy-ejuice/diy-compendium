Lemon concentrate diluted with water. This is almost flavorless at 7 weeks. I will have to try it freshly mixed to see if it's different.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:** None\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit:** 1/10\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Pairings:** To be honest, I'm not going to recommend any pairings right now as the flavor is so faint I believe it will be dominated by any additional flavor.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Notes:** This is probably another victim of the all too familiar lemon flavor fade. At a guess, I would say use this in less than 2 weeks after mixing or not at all. Further testing required.\n\n**EDIT:** They have changed the name of this flavor to Lemon Sicilian. It is the same though.","author":"mysticrosell","title":"Lemon Sicilian","url":"https://redd.it/5mx1ac","vendor":{"name":"Purilum","code":"PUR"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"PUR","title":"Lemon Sicilian"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
