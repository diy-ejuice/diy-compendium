    "result": {"data":{"reviewsJson":{"markdown":"**Setup:** Velocity 2 Clone, Dual 15 wrap 3mm Nifethal 70 coils @.18 ohms.  45W-80w power, 500F temp limit. Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Cherry Filling @ 3%, 70/30 VG/PG, Steeped 2 weeks.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Artificial cherry flavoring.  An astringent, bitter taste that builds into a sort of gummy mouthfeel.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Dead on for the same kind of bitter, mouth-numbing taste I got off [FLV Papaya Punch / maybe Peach Rings.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/5a8f1h/flv_papaya_punch/)  Its worth nothing that this get less unpleasant with more wattage and heat.  It isn't rubber or plastic, tastes a lot more neutral than that.  \n\n**Throat Hit:** 4/10. That bitter flavor is pretty mellow in terms of throat hit.  The cherry is just a bit harsh.\n\n**Uses:**  Cherry gummy candy.  Almost a gummied maraschino cherry vibe, so a slight accent anywhere you'd want that like a thick milkshake base or even an ice cream.  It would probably work for a cherry cordial.  Somebody said tobacco on FLV Rainier Cherry, so tobacco blends?\n\n**Pairings:** Candy texturizers. At a small percentge, heavy creamy flavors like Cap Vanilla Custard or TFA VBIC. Sweet chocolate. \n\n**Notes:**  So, what if the problem with cherry concentrates is an attempt to create a bright cherry note? I tried FLV Cherry Filling looking for a more subdued cooked cherry.  Maybe a little sweet and jammy with that comparatively subtle cherry note.\n\nThis is no way tastes realistic.  It's way too artificial and bright for a real cherry filling.  It's a too light and one-note for even a cheap hostess fruit pie neon red fruit filling.  It really does taste quite a bit like cherry gummies and whatever they are using for mouthfeel reinforces that.  It leaves a mouthfeel like cheap gummy bears, as opposed to either a nice rich pectin heavy natural filling or a corn starch thickened neon \"cherry\" filling.\n\nI'd say its a mostly competent cherry candy concentrate.","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Cherry Filling","url":"https://redd.it/5artw1","vendor":{"name":"Flavorah","code":"FLV"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FLV","title":"Cherry Filling"}},
