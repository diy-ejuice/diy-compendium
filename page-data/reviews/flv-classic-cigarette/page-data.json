Use sparingly.\n- Imo, this is a flav in a similar category to Black Fire, Dirty Neutal Base, etc. It's a tobacco additive that will bring the vibe of burning tobacco.\n- I'll say again, this is a down and dirty bacco additive and I recommend it for serious tobacco enthusiasts only who are looking to experiment and develop that real cigarette taste.","author":"T_Mace","title":"Classic Cigarette","url":"https://redd.it/5fkk13","vendor":{"name":"Flavorah","code":"FLV"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FLV","title":"Classic Cigarette"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
