I was warned ahead of time that if I were to vape this straight, my coils would only last a few rounds. Obviously, I didn't do that but the results were still quite the same. I'm absolutely in love with this flavor, it's perhaps in my top 10 of all time. The tough part is finding the balance between sweetness and flavor. \n\nAs the title states, this is part of their Sweet Betsy like which essentially took flavors from their various other lines and sweetened them up. The thing I love about this is that the sweet taste does not give off any chemical sweet tastes, it's really clean and packed with flavor. In all honesty, I refilled my dripper maybe 10 times before I had to rewick. Each time I filled, I got 15-20 good hauls off it. My coils were pretty wrecked and there was no pushing it forward.\n\nThe cookie flavor though, it's absolutely unreal. It has this really warm fresh baked feeling to it. It is quite grainy and crunchy, if that makes sense. The taste, to me is like a chocolate chip cookie, minus the chocolate chips. The cookie has a nice warm buttery texture/feel to it and complimented by the sweetness of everything, it is unlike any cookie I've had. If I had to make a comparison I'd say it's something like a combination of CAP Sugar Cookie, FA Cookie and maybe a touch of INW Biscuit. Throw in some smooth Buttery texture and that's what Sweet Betsy Cookie is. Either way you cut it, this is exceptional.\n\n**Off Flavors**\n\nSurprisingly, there are none. I thought with this being so sweet,I'd get some burnt sugars or something but the whole thing comes across really clean\n\n**Possible Pairings**\n\nOk, so here's where it gets a bit tricky. Stand alone at 10%, the flavor is really really nice. Downside is the destruction of coils. I think going down to 5% might improve it a bit but I'm getting the feeling this is more of an additive than a main flavor note. It does work really well with the Butter Cookie flavor from Flavor Monks. I placed it in there with FLV Sweet Coconut,FLV Hazelnut and a touch of INW Biscuit. I placed it at 0.75% and I could definitely pick up on its subtle notes. The sweetness was just right but the wear on coils was still a bit more than normal. Its worth noting that when I first made this mix, I used the SB Cookie at 4% and it was far too high. Overall, the flavor is amazing, just treat this as a additive like a sweetner but keeping in mind it has a flavor profile to it.","author":"Lampburglar","title":"Sweet Betsy Cookie","url":"https://redd.it/7fsh9u","vendor":{"name":"Flavour Monks","code":"FM"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FM","title":"Sweet Betsy Cookie"}},
