It does have a nice bit of sweetness to it, reminiscent of honey, but very much floral. I liken it to a floral sweetness if you ever need that in a recipe. It is very potent, and probably will never need to be used above 0.25% or 0.5%. I'm glad they called it \"Honey Bee\" because this makes me think of the bees transporting pollen (floral) to create their honey (sweet). I could see using this in a tea or spiced tea vape that requires honey, with proper steeping and flavor bending.\n\n**On the Nose**  \nFlowers. With a somewhat dark undertone. \n\n**Recommended Usage**  \n*Stand alone*: 0.5%\n\n*In a mix*: <=0.25%. \n\n**Throat**  \nMild\n\n**Ideal Pairings**  \nFlorals, tobaccos, spices\n\n**Steep**  \n5-7 Days\n\n**Recipe Idea: [Lemon Honey Cough Drop](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/6407#lemon_honey_cough_drop_by_cheebasteeba)**  \n*Ratio: 12.5PG/87.5VG*  \n*Steep: 1+ week* \n\n**Ingredient**|**%**|\n:--|:--|\nINW Eucalyptus w/ Mint|1.5%|\nJF Juicy Lemon|3%|\nFLV Honey Bee|0.25%|\n\nThe FLV Honey Bee here I feel is essential, although it's a bummer it takes so long to steep to be in a good spot (especially if you have a sore throat and need something straight-away!). It works especially well here, since they INW Eucalyptus w/ Mint is more on the end of floral vapes, and you want some sweetness and honey to really make it palatable. The honey flavor in the honeys we're used to is floral, there's no way around it, and that's usually a bad thing, but here it works well to give you both the honey you want as well as complimenting the floral aspect of this vape.
