And eGo aio with .6 oms.\n\nTested at 10%(solo) with 4 weeks steeping, 3%(solo), 0.25%(recipe) 1 week steeping. 70/30.\n\nA friend of mine gave me to try a bit of \"Tabacco Bastards No.21 Mint By FlavorMonks\". In Their site we can read:\n\n>*Flavor description:*  \n>  \n>Pure generic tobacco flavor with a natural mint taste. A perfectly  balanced medium-strong minty flavor for a refreshing throat-hit.Â \n\nAnd what i got was a super rich cream without vanilla notes with a very faint tobacco note in the background that i couldn't identify. But the cream was really \"fluffy\" and well balanced with the mint. Since they only have one mint, i thought i could had my favorite tobaccos ... and its a waste of 7 euros for a 10ml's of this. Those mother fu$&$& are expensive as shit. And this one is definitely a miss. This backstory will make sense.\n\n**Expectations:** A super creamy leafy spearmint. I mean... 7 euros for a bottle. Give me the best spearmint ever... right?\n\n**What will you get?** Eucalyptus, spearmint, cream, sweet, shit ton of coolness. Too much things going on really limiting the uses of this flavoring. At the end of the day for me in the back of my mind this is more of a one shot then a single flavor. WTF?!?!?\n\n**Solo flavor test at 3% on the hadaly:** The Eucalyptus part is what it is. I can't tell a difference about this one or vt Eucalyptus Robusta. On the inhale this is the top note that you will taste. As second note you will get the spearmint part delicious realistic. Good body to it, without any leafy notes or off notes even at this high for a RDA. I don't have SC spearmint (yet) to compare it realistic wise, but this one is definitely more realistic then flv spearmint. Under all, but blending with the spearmint we have a really sweet cream with a really great body! Its thicker then flv cream/flv whipped cream (without the vanilla, butter). The mouth feel if really rich, at this high it felt i was vaping the fluffiness of FA cream fresh at 2% without the milk notes ... just a mouthful light sweet cream. Wish they sold this cream in a separate flavor without any of those extras. And the  cooling effect is super super high. Imagine 1% of ws-5 with 0.4 of ws-23. All the flavors are really well balanced though... except for the cooling effect. Didn't noticed a difference with steeping either.\n\nMy sweet spot with menthol is  .4% of ws-5 with 1% ws-23... and 3% was unbearable freshly dripped.\n\n**10% on a eGo aio MTL:**  Yep, i get everything that i wrote up above. Really well balanced, very nice one shot for pod systems too for sure.\n\n**0.25% on a recipe:** Now here's the major problem with this flavor. Its a fucking muting monster. That's why on the \"Tabacco Bastards No.21 Mint by Flavormonks\" the tobacco is so faint. I mean, .25 of this totally vanished 1% of TPA orance cream. lol 4% inw pinnaple with 2% cap golden pinnaple? gone! .5% inw grape? gone. Either you go the your strongest single flavor top note or it will disappear. The only one that i could taste was .5% inw shisha orange in a mix... till i quite on this flavor all together.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Super smooth.\n\n**Off-flavors:** None. Zero leafy notes, peppermint, wintergreen, or any other flavors then those described.\n\n**Suggested pairings**: Pair it with a super strong top note tobacco of your choice and crank it high on your pod or MTL and you're good to go. Anything else... forget it. Pick flavors that won't mute fruits, adapt your base.  'cause the only thing this one won't mute its your frustration. Have fun making your own version of this instead.\n\nIf i wanted to mimic this flavor at 3% i would start with something like this:\n\n2% vt Eucalyptus Robusta.\n\ntry to find a good realistic spearmint and put it as much as you would put 1% flv spearmint (great spearmint, but candy)\n\n2% flv cream equivalent\n\n.2 cap super sweet\n\n1% ws-5 (ugh)\n\n.4% ws-23","author":"KillScreen-","title":"Mint","url":"https://redd.it/ddd3xa","vendor":{"name":"Flavour Monks","code":"FM"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FM","title":"Mint"}},
