Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** CAP SilverLine Whipped Marshmallow, 2 and 5%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 9 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Decent mouthfeel and a very light cereal marshmallow kind of flavor in here.  Unless I'm missing something huge, this is an extremely soft flavor.\n\nThe marshmallow I can taste is extremely faint.  I'm getting a light dry cereal marshmallow sweetness on the inhale, and just not much at all on the exhale.  There's a vanilla here, and from what I can taste of it's a bright frosting type of vanilla, but it's again really light.\n\nThere is some kind of mouthfeel here, again nothing too intense. I'm picking it up mostly as a slight thickness to the mouthfeel. It's also maybe a bit dry.  It's like a less intense version of the mouthfeel from a very low percentage of FA Meringue.  Mouthfeel seems to top out relatively quickly, it doesn't get markedly more thick as you increase the percentage.\n\nThere's a light sweetness here, along with a subtle, almost fruity tart notes in the background. I'm guessing they are only showing up because there is so little going on with this flavor in terms of an actual marshmallow taste.\n\nOf the marshmallow I can taste, seems closer to FA or FLV Marshamllow with that drier, cereal marshmallow kind of vibe. Noticeably softer and less concentrated than either.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Does the lack of flavor count as an off-flavor? I'm just not getting much actual flavor out of this.  There's also a little bit of tartness that doesn't quite seem to fit.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  There isn't much here to not be smooth.\n\n**Percentage testing:**At 2% I get a light mouthfeel, a bare hint of vanilla, and nothing else expect a little bit of a tart tanginess.  This doesn't taste like much.\n\nAt 5%, this is still lighter. I do get some cereal marshmallow on the inhale but it's weak and the exhale is almost completely flat.  Some increased density to the mouthfeel but it's not drastic.\n\nTesting this at higher percentages, I'm still not getting much here.  This at 8%, 10%, and even 15% doesn't really have a full marshmallow flavor.  I cranked it all up all the way to 25%, and was still struggling.  There is either something massive I'm missing here, or this is comically weak.  Checking out some other juices, it's not olfactory fatigue in general.  There just isn't much here, for me at least.\n\nOne of three things is true: (1)I got a bad batch, (2)There is something I physically can't taste going on here, or (3) this is incredibly weak.  Based on the other concentrates in this line and the idea that chef's generally doesn't mess these things up, I'm inclined to say it's the third option, but if you have a different experience please share.\n\nJust based on these tests, I'd probably be using this at around 8%.  I didn't notice any benefit from going higher with this.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**I'm not sure there is a compelling reason to use this over other marshmallow flavors.  It doesn't have much in the way of flavor and the sweetness or mouthfeel really isn't anything to write home about.  If you are going to use it, use in the places you'd normally use a marshmallow and crank up the percentage?\n\n**Second Opinions:**  Still fairly new.\n\n[Shoutout to ceedee99uk for linking reviews from PeegoreVapes in another thread.](https://peegorevapes.wordpress.com/2017/10/04/capella-silver-line-affordable-flavours/)  He's saying this is overbearing at 5%.
