Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** HS Green Orange @ 3%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 14 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  A full, robust tangerine bordering on orange flavor. Sweet without being overbearing and smooth for a citrus.  Moderate body, and some hints of actual fleshy citrus.  Restrained zest with some hints of lime along with the tangerine.\n\nInhale is mostly building tangerine zest.  Slightly bitter.  Could be the power of suggestion, but it does taste a little green or limey.  Very fresh tasting zest. The zest on inhale has a little orange sweetness sitting under it.  On the exhale, zest stays on the palate but you get slightly fleshy orange or tangerine.  Actual fruit flavor is medium sweet, and lacking some of the acidity you'd expect from a straight orange.  Again, more like a mandarin or tangerine.  Really lightly floral.  Some warm density on the fruit.  That zest lingers for a quite a while, staying a bit bitter but fairly realisitic.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  None.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Tiny bit harsh, but that's mostly the zest on the inhale.  Very little throat hit, especially for a citrus.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:** Mellow enough for both heavy and lighter creams.  Sweet enough for orange or more realistic mandarin candy flavors.  Would go well in sweeter fruit mixes, should blend with both bright and jammy fruits.  Floral notes are restrained enough for blending with small amounts of peaches and pears.  Zest component is relatively restrained, so maybe not a sharp flavor for cocktail vapes.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nS&V concentration testing, I get a sweet tangerine fleshy fruit flavor down at 1%.  Not quite dense enough for a primary note, but it's present and doesn't have a whole lot of zest there.  Zest just ramps up after that. Actual fruit flavor plateaus early, and you are just adding back in that sharper zest above 1%.  About 2% seems to be the sweet spot for the zest before it crosses into a bit bitter and too pronounced.  I'd mix at 1% if you just want the fruit part of this, and 2% if you'd like more of the citrus top notes for a fuller tangerine.\n\nPutting it in context, seems to take the better parts of FA Mandarin and FW Blood Orange and kind of splits the difference.  Quite a bit less harsh than both, and has some of the good full citrus notes of Blood Orange, with that mandarin sweetness.  Doesn't push into full candy like CAP Sweet Tangerine.  And it has some fleshy body and juice to it unlike CAP Juicy Orange or FLV Orange Citrus.\n\nIt's a bit indistinct as a single type of citrus and definitely more on the tangerine side of the fence, but it's a really solid realistic flavor.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nNot a whole lot to go off.\n\n[This is the closest I found to a review.  It's on vaping underground, user rchmx reports \"A nice and realistic tart orange flavor...a bit more just plucked from the tree.\"](http://vapingunderground.com/threads/has-anyone-tried-hangsen-flavor-concentrates-other-than-tobacco.287324/)\n\nSo, with a lack of other information, at least this is interesting.  [I'm guessing this is modeled on the Cam s√†nh or King Orange.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cam_s%C3%A0nh)  Apparently it's closer to a mandarin.  Never tried one, but hybrid citrus is usually pretty damn interesting.\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Green Orange","url":"https://redd.it/5iiaki","vendor":{"name":"Hangsen","code":"HS"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"HS","title":"Green Orange"}},
