Really prime as a standalone, one you surely don't want to miss out on if you like German Chocolate Cake. It's got a delectable cakey chocolate, and a tasty sweet coconut undertone to it. Even though this flavoring is great by itself, its complexity does make it somewhat more difficult to mix with. Its obvious role is going to be bakeries focusing on chocolate and coconut, not many other directions it can be taken due to the pronounced chocolate and coconut.

Bringing some caramel to the party is a great idea, as well as some coconut (TFA Coconut Candy seemed to be a good direction). I imagine HS Australian Chocolate or another good dark chocolate will play really nicely. \n\nProbably the most notable recipes I was able to find were these two:  \n\n* **[Rumpelstiltskin](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/411vh9/do_you_need_a_quick_dense_cakey_coconut_chocolate/)** by /u/InsigmaTheory  \n* **[DaMomma's German Chocolate Cake](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/recipe/138232/DaMomma%2527s+German+Chocolate+Cake)** by Alisa","author":"CheebaSteeba","title":"Chocolate Deutsch","url":"https://redd.it/4p8vx7","vendor":{"name":"Flavorah","code":"FLV"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FLV","title":"Chocolate Deutsch"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
