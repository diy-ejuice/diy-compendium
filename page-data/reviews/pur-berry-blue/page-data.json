Absolutely delicious and perfect for desserts and fruit blends!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Manufacturer Suggested Percentage:** 5-10%\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Aroma:** Blueberry, raspberry, sweetness.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Flavor Description:** Black raspberry or blackberry jam or jelly? I'm not positive on the berry blend here, but those are the ones that stand out for me. Moderate to strong flavor, it has a natural sweetness. Meaning it doesn't taste artificially sweetened, but it is sweet to the level of a jam or syrup. I don't find any artificial flavoring notes in the fruit either, tastes very authentic. It has a jammy cooked fruit type flavor. Very well layered and saturated in flavor, I know there are additional underlying berry flavors hiding there, I just can't identify them individually. They are from the seeded family though. I suspect marionberry, but I'm not positive.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:** None\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit:** 3/10\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Uses:** Because of it's cooked flavor, this will be the perfect fruit to use in baked applications. Pastries, danishes, cakes, doughnuts, pies, waffles, muffins, and coffee cakes are just a few. I would also be inclined to use this to make custards or flans, or as a fruit syrup on ice cream.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Notes:** Has a bit of throat hit, so I'm imagining it was prominent before steep, so I would recommend at least a 2 week steep. I'm hoping further steeping will help as I'm not a fan of throat hit. If not I will try a lower percentage, maybe 5% instead of 7%? Single flavor usage for me will be 5-7%, and 1.5-3% in blends.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Other Opinions:** From louiesquared at ELR: I know this one is called Berry Blue but I am definitely getting a darker berry from it. Possibly Blackberry or Boysenberry. Reminds me of Smuckers BlackBerry Jam but more of a syrup. Itâ€™s really good. I will definitely be adding this to some Vanilla Custard in the future.","author":"mysticrosell","title":"Berry Blue","url":"https://redd.it/75mii7","vendor":{"name":"Purilum","code":"PUR"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"PUR","title":"Berry Blue"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
