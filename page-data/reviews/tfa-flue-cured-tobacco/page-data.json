Although I personally feel it needs a higher percentage to really shine and for the tobacco properties to come through.\n\n**Pairings** - bakery, chocolate, liquer, dark fruits/berries/apples\n\n**End notes** - From my understanding, this flavour has been discontinued because one of the ingredients inside is facing scarcity. However, after doing some research, it seems TFA has disclosed the recipe to a few people who asked. And fortunately, my local vendor managed to procure some for whatever reason.\n\nIf you manage to get your hands on this, it's definitely worth a pick up. Again, it's more of a base ingredient but because it's so neutral, it works as a strong foundation to work off it. I have never personally tried Flavorah's Flue Cured but I've read from many that it's fairly identical.","author":"thedirtyprojector","title":"Flue Cured Tobacco","url":"https://redd.it/5d711a","vendor":{"name":"The Flavor Apprentice","code":"TFA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"TFA","title":"Flue Cured Tobacco"}},
