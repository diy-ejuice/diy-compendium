This is a fairly strong concentrate.\n\n**Pairings:** Dark fruits, creams, tea, chocolate.\n\n**Notes:**   This flavor is very powerful, it is recommended that you start at 0.5% and work up as desired so it doesn't over-power a mix.  May also require a bit more steep time to reach full potential compared to most fruits.  I plan to re-visit this one in a week or so and include any further notes.\n\n**Bonus notes:**  I had to look up what a Bilberry even was, turns out they're closely related but not quite the same as a common American blueberry: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilberry\n\n\nEDIT: [Link to all of our flavor reviews in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)","author":"wh1skeyk1ng","title":"Bilberry","url":"https://redd.it/4qd34b","vendor":{"name":"Flavour Art","code":"FA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FA","title":"Bilberry"}},
