    "result": {"data":{"reviewsJson":{"markdown":"**Percentage Used:** 2%\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Equipment Used:**  Troll RDA with a wickless single SS .8 ohm Clapton coil at 20W.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**PG/VG:** 30/70\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Steep Time:** 6 Days and 2 Weeks\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Aroma:** peppermint candy, candy cane, butter mint.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Flavor Description:** At a 6 day steep this is a smooth, sweet, candied peppermint. It's very much a butter mint with the familiar body and buttery creamy mouth texture, not the hard candy or candy cane. Although it could be taken in that direction in mixes if desired. It provides a chilly cooling sensation without being peppery or too strong. At a 2 week steep this has mellowed slightly. I don't want to say the flavor has faded, it hasn't. I guess the best way to describe it is that it has continued to smooth out and become silky. It's still a wonderful creamy butter mint. The buttery creaminess is very distinctive in a good way. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:** None\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit:** 2/10\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Pairings:** I can see this being used to provide light peppermint to gums, cookies, teas, beverages, tobacco. This will also add a very buttery minty creaminess to chocolates, ice creams, coffees, custards, cheesecakes, milkskakes. Or make flavored butter mints by adding vanillas or fruits.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Notes:** Although this did settle a bit with the steep, this was also very good as a S&V. It's just slightly stronger for the first few days, but still smooth, mouth-watering and delicious. For a SF I would probably bump it up to 3-4%, and .5-2% as an accent.\n","author":"mysticrosell","title":"Butter Mint","url":"https://redd.it/5qyqjx","vendor":{"name":"Purilum","code":"PUR"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"PUR","title":"Butter Mint"}},
