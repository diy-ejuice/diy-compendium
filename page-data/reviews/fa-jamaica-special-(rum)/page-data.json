Comes off as more of a dark rum or butter rum, but without too much of a \"candied\" nuance.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  none\n\n**Throat hit:** 4/10 rather smooth\n\n**Uses:** At 1-2%, plays well into cocktail recipes (obviously), also gives a warming or baked affect at lower (<1%) percentages to fruits in a bakery mix.  Could work as a sweetener as well.\n\n**Pairings:**  FA cola, coconut, caramel, butterscotch, coffee, preferred fruits, Koolada.\n\n**Notes:**  If you're formulating a recipe and looking to incorporate rum, this should probably be in your stash.   /u/ID10-T has some stellar cocktail recipes on ATF that feature this flavoring, check them out!\n\nEDIT: [Link to all of our flavor reviews in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)","author":"wh1skeyk1ng","title":"Jamaica Special (Rum)","url":"https://redd.it/5a173u","vendor":{"name":"Flavour Art","code":"FA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FA","title":"Jamaica Special (Rum)"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
