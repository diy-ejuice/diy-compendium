It waters the flavors down slightly and adds a super subtle, wonderful coolness. It works great as an accent to drink or cocktail recipes. One thing to note is that in using other coolants, it is much less potent -- you'll want to use it around 1-2% to get the effect you're looking for instead of 0.25%-1% (for those that go higher than 1% with TFA Koolada or something similar you will not be impressed with the level of cooling on this flavoring). This flavoring works really well with heavy/forward flavors or syrupy flavors since it does seem to subdue flavors a bit with diluted watery-ness. Where I get off flavors from things like TFA Koolada, I really get no flavor at all from this one. The best way to describe it is if you dropped some ice or ice-water in your recipe. \n\n**On the Nose**  \nNothing \n\n**Recommended Usage**  \n*Stand alone*: 3-5%\n\n*In a mix*: 1-2%\n\n**Throat**  \nNone\n\n**Ideal Pairings**  \nCocktails, sodas, beverages\n\n**Steep**  \n1-3 Days\n\n**Recipe Inclusion: [Wolf Cola](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/58269#wolf_cola_by_cheebasteeba)**  \n*Ratio: 30PG/70VG*  \n*Steep: S&V* \n\n**Ingredient**|**%**|\n:--|:--|\nDF Ice -- Original|1.5%|\nFA Cola (USA Pleasure)|4%|\nFLV Rich Cinnamon|0.125%|\nINW Marzipan|1%|\n\nThis recipe tastes like a liter a' cola you got at the drive through that's been sitting for about 20 mins; right as it's super refreshing, slightly effeversecnt still, and diluted with much needed water (ice). The FA cola obviously carries most of the flavor, gaining a nice cherry body from the marzipan and using the ice to carry the flavor into a refreshing territory. One drop of Rich Cinnamon/30mL gives just an extra touch of spice and effervesence to promote the flavor of the only cola for true refreshment, Wolf Cola: Splash in to the beast.","author":"CheebaSteeba","title":"Ice -- Original","url":"https://redd.it/6rb32z","vendor":{"name":"Delosi Flavors","code":"DF"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"DF","title":"Ice -- Original"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
