Main flavor of this is dark caramel/Maple syrup with a faint bakery note in the back.  kinda reminds me of a soggy stroopwafel. needs more of a bite to the cookie.\n\n**After 3 week Steep**\n\nI feel the flavor died a bit.  During the inhale you get some unflavored sweetness, and during the exhale you get a faded maple syrup/bakery note.  Aftertaste has a slight alcohol note.  The pancake syrup aroma after the exhale is gone as well.  I really should have tested this at a higher %.\n\n**Possible Pairings**\n\nI can see this be used as a base in a pacake/waffle/french toast/Stroopwafel recipe. it's pretty muddled and flat in each area, but that allows stronger and brighter flavors, like FA Cookie, FA maple syrup, INW waffle, to be brought in and still have a homogenized taste.  \n\n**Other Stuffs:** \n\nCame up with an idea the other day to post up my ever growing list of flavors up on google sheets so you guys can check it out and suggest what flavors I should test and post notes on.  A lot of these I bought as a sure why not add on purchase to get free shipping, so they're still untested.  I can prolly knock out around 3-5 flavors per week depending on steeping times.  you can find the list [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O5hevQU7s0fiP2aHTf11o3q9Iqgccf_POFrYiPY_KM0/edit?usp=sharing).","author":"myep0nine","title":"Cookie","url":"https://redd.it/4o09ol","vendor":{"name":"Jungle Flavors","code":"JF"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"JF","title":"Cookie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
