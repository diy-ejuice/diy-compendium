Sweetness, tanginess.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Flavor Description:** This starts with fresh naturally sweetened ripe strawberry, I'm not getting any artificial or candy tones from this one. About mid inhale the kiwi comes out to play, slightly tangy and juicy. The kiwi is also very natural flavored as well, and continues through the exhale while lingering on the tongue. This is very well balanced and both play well together. It's got a very nice body to it with great vapor production. It's naturally sweet like fresh fruit should be, not overdone at all.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:** None\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit:** 3/10\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Pairings:** Any fruit for a fruit salad or mixed fruit, watermelon, coconut, creams, custards, fruit juices and cocktails, fruit smoothies, tropical blends, koolada, sour.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Notes:** This is a very refreshing and natural fruit blend. Very simple but a great single flavor at 8%. I'd probably use 6-9% for a single flavor and 2-4% in a mix.\n","author":"mysticrosell","title":"Kigola","url":"https://redd.it/5s6njw","vendor":{"name":"Purilum","code":"PUR"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"PUR","title":"Kigola"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
