Aromatics are tobaccos that have toppings like cherry, vanilla, liquorice, etc.\n- This will blend very well in aromatic pipe tobacco mixes.\n- I prefer non-aromatic tobaccos so I won't be reaching for this often unless using it at very low percents. If you enjoy a bit of sweetness in your leaf, this could make for an interesting ingredient.\n- To be clear, it's not sweet like EM or Sucralose. It's sweet because of the molasses note.\n- If I was trying to clone Halo's Torque 56, I would definitely try putting this in there. Actually, when I think of tobaccos like Torque 56, this flavor starts to make a lot of sense.","author":"T_Mace","title":"Arabic Tobacco","url":"https://redd.it/5qoz7m","vendor":{"name":"Hangsen","code":"HS"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"HS","title":"Arabic Tobacco"}},
