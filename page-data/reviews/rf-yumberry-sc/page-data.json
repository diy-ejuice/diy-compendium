This is my first experience with yumberry, and I'm not sure what the real thing tastes like. The flavor is similar to boysenberry to me, which has been until now my favorite. That type of bright refreshing sweet berry without any perfume or tart flavor. Seems to be a good percentage of flavor. I am going to mix another tester at 1.5% to see if I can push it a little stronger without adding perfume, just to see how well it will stand up in heavier bakery flavors.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTime will tell if this stays the same strength or deepens a little with a steep. Already planning Yumberries & Cream, Yumberry Danish, Yumberry Cobbler, Yumberry Ice Cream, Waffles with Yumberries, PB & Yumberry Jam Sandwich.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nEDIT: At a 4 week steep. This flavor has surprisingly faded a little bit with the longer steep. Still bright and juicy, just not as strong. I will be using this as a S&V at around 1-1.5% as it's plenty strong as a SF. If using in something I will be steeping I would start at 1.5-2.5% SF. Starting point as a mixer for me will be at 1% and go up from there. Very refreshing, I'm liking it a lot. If you like boysenberry you will like this one.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nEDIT: Real Flavors has announced they will be changing the names of their Raw Extracts to Super Concentrates.","author":"mysticrosell","title":"Yumberry SC","url":"https://redd.it/55sipy","vendor":{"name":"Real Flavors","code":"RF"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"RF","title":"Yumberry SC"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
