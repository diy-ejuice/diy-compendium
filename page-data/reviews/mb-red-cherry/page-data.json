Tested once a week for a total of 28 days\nFlavoring was purchased from DIYVAPORSUPPLY\n\nI DO NOT suggest mixing at 7% it tastes like sweet red cherry cough syrup even after a 4 week steep. \n\n5% also tasted very much like a cherry cough syrup/cough drop\n\n4% was the sweet spot for me. Even though it had a slight medicinal cherry off note until the 2 week test.  \nAfter 4 weeks of steeping I was left with a sweet slightly candy like red cherry. It did have some authentic cherry qualities & some syrupy notes. Which is where MB gets the cherry compote comparison. \n\nI would rate this flavor 4/5\n\nPairings for this flavor would be.
