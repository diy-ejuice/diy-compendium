Cream?\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Flavor Description:** At 3 days this is definitely an authentic fresh banana. It's balanced on the edge of ripeness, just barely past the green yet not over ripe. It almost has a creamy texture to the body, but just the creamy meatiness of a natural banana and not an added cream. Not cloying at all, and not candy.\n\nAt 4 weeks this has smoothed out and become a creamy fresh banana without any hints of green. It's ripe and has natural levels of sweetness, nothing cloying or over ripe. A very balanced flavor, beyond green and before over ripe. There are no peel or green flavors in this.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:** None\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit:** 1/10\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Pairings:** Almost any fruit, especially those that pair well with banana like strawberry, kiwi, any tropicals fruits. Creams, custards, smoothies, shakes, nuts, honey.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Notes:** If you are looking for fresh banana, this is the one. I see it blending well with other fresh fruits. I don't think it would be good as the only banana anywhere you are looking for a cooked banana like bread or pastries or banana foster. In low percentages may add a bit of layering, but further testing is required to know for sure.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Comparison:** Comparing this to TFA Ripe Banana, this is much better for my tastes. The ripe banana has an over ripe almost starting to rot taint for my tastes, where as this is more of a perfectly ripened banana.","author":"mysticrosell","title":"Banana","url":"https://redd.it/62r6y8","vendor":{"name":"Purilum","code":"PUR"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"PUR","title":"Banana"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
