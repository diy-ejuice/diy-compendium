I'm vaping this on a Pulse RDA 0.25ohms 45 watts NI and KA single fused clapton. This is an excellent raspberry flavor that taste like its dipped in honey and covered with white chocolate. The raspberry and the honey flavors mixed at this percentage have no floral notes at all. Its a nice sweet and juicy raspberry flavor. The white chocolate is in the background to me but its there. Its a nice white chocolate flavor with light cocoa under tones. This is probably one of the best honey flavors I have tried to date. Most of the other honey flavors I have tried have had an offensive taste to it but this one does not. As far as the chili note I really didn't notice it until I dripped the juice on my hand and tasted it. Yep there it is. To me the chili/spicy flavor in here was almost unnoticed until I read the description. There is nothing fowl about the spicy note. It actually compliments the mix quite well! \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm kind of unsure as to using this at 6-7% because it seems perfect at 4%. I have already gone through 15ml's of this. Next time I mix this I will try it at 6%. I can honestly say this is a one shot. I don't really feel like this mix needs anything added to it. I guess if I wanted to add something to this I would maybe consider adding a blueberry, forest fruit, or black currant to give it more of a mixed berry flavor. Other than that I feel like for the description its dead on.
