I don't know what else I can say. Nothing magical about it, altho this is definitely worlds better than the rest of the coffee flavours I've tried. It's just a nice full bodied base that has just the right nose. Nothing as full bodied as a cup of Italian Espresso, more like an americano's smell. \n\nIt's good. I can see it paired with stuff like other coffees, creams maybe or some drink attempts. I am no mixologist nor am I into creamy vapes so just coupling it with other coffees. \n\n**Verdict**: 10/10 for the accurate coffee feel. As a single flavour tho I found it boring after 5 minutes and wouldn't continue like that.\n\nComplimentary recipe:\n\n3% VTA Coffee Base\n\n2% VTA Arabica Coffee\n\n1% VTA Strawberry Milk","author":"RoninVX","title":"Coffee Base","url":"https://redd.it/qctr1r","vendor":{"name":"Vape Train Australia","code":"VTA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"VTA","title":"Coffee Base"}},
