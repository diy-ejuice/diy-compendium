Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** CAP Butter Cream@ 4%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 24 days.\n\nBefore we begin here, /u/mlNikon/ and I posted reviews within 15 minutes of each other.  You should check that out [**here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/5fyj8h/cap_butter_cream/), especially because they get a clear butter flavor out of this.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  A subtle, undersweet, buttercream frosting flavor.  When I've made actual buttercream frosting I've always been suprised by how waxy and fatty-tasting it actually is.  Then I double the sugar and just go to fat-kid heaven.  This captures the feeling of an undersweetened homemade buttercream almost perfectly.\n\nDense inhale. No real discernible flavor, just a heavy richness. Exhale is more of the same. Light sweetness, dense creamy flavor without pronounced dairy notes.  I don't taste a ton going on here.  I'd classify this more as a mouthfeel additive as opposed to a flavor.  It gives the impression of buttery richness without cheesy dairy notes.  It also doesn't give me that stale cardboard taste that you can get with dense flavors that don't have a lot going on.  Finish is relatively clean, with just a lingering thick waxy mouthfeel.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Finish is a bit waxy, but not playdough / phenolic like CAP glazed donut.  It's a rich waxyness you'd get from an actual butter-cream.\n\n**Throat Hit:** 0/10\n\n**Uses:**  Dense, rich, thick mouthfeel for creams and cream mixes.\n\n**Pairings:**  This flavor is nuetral enough that your pairings should be wide open.  I added some buttercream to CAP cranberry and CAP grapefruit testers and it seems to work well with sharper fruits, so I'm going to officially say \"damn near anything\" including creams, all your fruits, bakeries, nuts, maybe even some tobaccos.  I'd stay away from anything too astringent or heavy menthol.\n\n**Notes:**  You should probably just check the second opinions down at the bottom here.  I get all mouthfeel and very subtle dairy notes.  In terms of percentages, 1-2% is the definite consensus.  I get a really noticeable change in mouthfeel as low as 1%.  I'd stay away from using this as a primary flavor.  The waxyness gets a bit much even at 4%.  If everyone else is right, and I am crazy, then the butter/dairy notes will be too pronounced at higher percentages.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nI picked this up (and I'm guessing I'm not alone here) when that Apple Buttah recipe from /u/goldfish18/ dropped.  [His description is basically straight up butter with a slight sweetness.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/4zqehv/apple_buttah_from_the_inaugural_diyordie_mixers/)\n\n[/u/thecleanvape calls it straight butter.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/3h8fnp/new_cream_capella_flavors/)\n\n[/u/RuntDastardly/ uses it a stroopwafel recipe for richness and the unctuous quality it brings to the table](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/4e7snt/dutchie_a_delicious_stroopwafel/)\n\n[ELR users pick up a strong butter taste](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/48949)\n\nSo, basically everyone else tastes heavy butter here.  I don't really.  I do get the impression of butter without the heavy dairy notes.  I'm willing to assume that my taste buds are weird, but YMMV.\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Butter Cream","url":"https://redd.it/5fybox","vendor":{"name":"Capella","code":"CAP"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"CAP","title":"Butter Cream"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
