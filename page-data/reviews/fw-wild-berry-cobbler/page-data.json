Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FW Wild Berry Cobbler, 2 and 4%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 13 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Accurate to profile, a berry cobbler. I get warm, dark, and jammy berries up front.  Berries taste closer to darker blackberries rather than something brighter like a raspberry, but they have a definite cooked, syrupy edge to them.  The cobbler in here is a little lighter and comes through mostly on the back of the exhale. Softer bakery note, tastes a little toasted but still pretty soft and soaked in that dark berry. Really solid flavor overall, and I think it pushes pretty close to a single flavor, especially at higher percentages.  Could maybe take a bit more of a soft bakery note to boost the cobbler part of this, and I wouldn't argue with some light bakery spice.  Could also go well with some whipped or ice cream.  I'd mix with this around 6% as a primary note.\n\nInhale is pretty heavy on the berries. Dark, jammy berries with a moderate but profile appropriate sweetness. It's odd, I don't really taste florals here, but I get some of that sharpness on the inhale I associate with floral notes. Berries carry through on the exhale.  Sweet, jammy black(ish)berries with a cooked warmth to them. Some more of that odd phantom floral sharpness in the top notes, but I still don't actually taste anything perfumey here. Cobbler comes through a bit clearer on the back half of the exhale. It's relatively subtle and soft, but there is some warm grain to this with maybe a hint of butter.  Almost like the muffin around the blueberries in a blueberry muffin or a legit cobbler. Beyond that sharpness, I'm not getting much in the way of throat hit, and while this is sweet it's pretty retrained. Some lingering pectin-y stickiness and and some of that cobbler bakery in the top notes.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  I don't taste florals here, but I feel them.  There is a sharpness to the way the flavor hits that doesn't really work with those warm, softer, sweet flavors. \n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light.  That sharpness isn't really a throat hit, but it keeps this from being 100% smooth.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This is really close to a single flavor. It's pretty well balanced as is.  I'm not the \"sweetener guy\" but this seems like it would be good to go with a little bit of your sweetener of your choice to soften that sharpness a bit and really saturate your palate.\n\nIf you did want to bolster this a bit, the cobbler is maybe just a bit on the light side.  A softer bakery like CAP Sugar Cookie may work to build up that cobbler a bit without any additional sharpness from a more AP forward bakery.  I also think this could stand a light touch of some cinnamon to it.\n\nIn terms of additions, this seems like a good candidate for some a la mode, with some ice cream or whipped cream. You could also add a whole bunch more creams and go for something like a blackberry cobbler milkshake.\n\n**Notes:**  This seems like the cobbler part takes a bit of a steep to come out. 2% seems a bit light. Nothing weird about it, just feels like the flavor is a bit turned down. 4% is starting to feel fairly full. Cobbler bakery is coming through a bit clearer and feels just a bit richer. 6% fresh is tasting a bit sharp, but judging from the steep at 4% should settle in pretty nicely. Berry is a bit fuller and the bakery that I am getting seems pretty solid. I'm starting to taste, as opposed to just feel, the florals at 8% and the bakery cobbler doesn't seem much better than 6%.  I'd probably stop at around 6% with this, although a longer steep and more creams would probably let you push it a bit higher.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nNah, still new.\n\n[Here's the Flavorwest product page.
