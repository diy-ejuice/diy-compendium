Very very slightly tangy but missing the sharp bite usually present with lemonade. It has a very chemical off note at first vape that fades quickly with further vaping. Very faint artificial strawberry syrup. This is a sweet lemonade versus a tart one. It's good, but too sweet and not enough sour for my personal tastes.\n\nAt 4 weeks this has steeped into a fantastic and tangy strawberry lemonade. The strawberry syrup and sweetness has mellowed a lot. While still slightly artificial, it is balanced much better with the lemonade now and doesn't overwhelm it, allowing the tartness to come through. It has developed into a nice and well layered lemonade.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:** Very slight chemical note at first draw or 2, quickly disappears.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit:** 2/10\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Pairings:** PG and/or VG? A more fresh strawberry flavor? A blend of berries.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Notes:** This is a very good and refreshing drink. Very limited on mixing possibilities though. It's of medium strength at 4%, probably 6-7% would be better for a single flavor mix.","author":"mysticrosell","title":"Strawberry Lemonade","url":"https://redd.it/62rnbx","vendor":{"name":"Purilum","code":"PUR"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"PUR","title":"Strawberry Lemonade"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
