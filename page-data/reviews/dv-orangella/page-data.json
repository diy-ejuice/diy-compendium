Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Decandent Vapours Orangella @ 5 and 10% 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 7 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** [Orangina (warning: link contains hilarious sexy animals, but there is technically a bottle of the stuff in the corner. It's just too beautiful not to share.)](http://img21.mtime.cn/mg/2010/11/30/145514.37859514.jpg) Not quite an orange soda, not quite orange juice. Kind of tastes like orange pith and Tang mixed together, but a whole lot better than that sounds. A bit sweet for straight navel oranges, with a bit of something that feels quite a bit like carbonation. Works really well as a single flavor, but feels like it would get watered down really quickly in a mix. Needs around 10% to get going, although good up to about 15%.\n\nInhale has sharper orange right up front. Not really a zest flavor, per se, but some of that same kind of peel oil brightness and just a bit of bitterness that reminds of the actual skin and pith on an orange segment. Maybe a bit bright and sweet for normal grocery store navel orange, closer to a tangerine but not too candied. Sticky sweetness underneath that, with a lot of texture if not a real density. Almost gritty, simulating some carbonation. Exhale is pretty spot on for the aforementioned Orangina. Orange zest top notes but less bitter and sharp. Base flavor tastes a lot like Tang, definitely citrus but not a whole lot of body. Still pulling off the carbonated thing fairly well. Sugary sweet but not cloying, really well balanced overall. I get some moderate harshness on the exhale, with lingering orange pith.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  I'm not sure if this was meant to be modelled on the orange version of limoncello, but it doesn't really hit that for me. It's a bit too light and sparkling for the heavy and syrupy orangella. For something pushing towards Orangina, no off flavors.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Moderate. It's definitely there. Not horrific for a citrus but still a bit harsh on the exhale.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I wouldn't mess with this too much. Between the balance of the tarter more realistic orange, the Tang-ish body, and the carbonation I don't feel like this needs a lot of help anywhere to pull off a sparkling orangeade.  I could see maybe a lime accent, or some cooling if you're feeling crazy, but adding other strong non-citrus flavors is going to to screw your balance up and I can see that Tang base getting watery pretty quickly.\n\n**Notes:**  So pretty par for the course for Decadent Vapours, this is going to end up needing a high percentage to really come through. At 5% it's thin.  You get mostly the Tang out of this, with the more realistic orange notes and carbonation way too light. At 7.5% it still feel pretty thin. More realistic orange, but still tastes pretty watery. 10% is a a bit disconcertingly light for such a high percentage, but it's starting to feel like a full flavor.  Realistic orange, Tang, and carbonation is all present. 12.5% is orangier, seems like a better single flavor option than 10%. I'm getting a pretty noticeable uptick in harshness though. 15% is fairly harsh but tastes more like an orange than Orangina.  Pretty harsh though.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\nNot a lot for the concentrate.\n\n[Here's the product page from Decadent Vapours, their description is \"A mellow, mouth-watering all-day-vape with a main body of fleshy orange and a welcomed subtle tanginess at the finish.\"](http://decadentvapours.com/shop/diy-e-liquid/flavour-concentrates/orange-flavour-concentrate/)\n\nHere are some reviews for the finished juice (probably 20% at 50/50...\n\n[An actual written juice review. They dug it: \"Fantastic flavour. The orange tastes real rather than an overly sweet cordial while at the same time manages to keep things smooth on the inhale.\"](http://www.ecigclick.co.uk/decadent-vapours-orangella-review/)\n\n[And another one... \"Very lite fresh flavours perfect for a warm summers day,  giving you a real sense of freshness with every vape. And just the right amount of sweetness at the tip of your tongue.\"](http://www.myvapingreviews.co.uk/2014/07/review-of-orangella-ejuice-by-decadent.html)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**\n\nH/T to /u/ID10-T/ for the suggestion.","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Orangella","url":"https://redd.it/6j6ork","vendor":{"name":"Decadent Vapours","code":"DV"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"DV","title":"Orangella"}},
