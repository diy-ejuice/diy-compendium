Dense mouthfeel and very nicely balanced between the sweet and savory aspects. On the exhale there’s a nice of bit vanilla peeking through. Tastes like a less dry, and overall tastier version of INW biscuit. \n\n**Off-flavors**: Nada, Zip, Zilch \n\n**Throat hit**: Smooth, very smooth.\n\n**Uses**: All the things! This will work great as a cookie or pastry type base right around 2-3%. Use at .5-1% for a nice toasty biscuit accent, adds some body with its buttery style. This is concentrated stuff just like most of JF’s line; but this IMO is not as strong as INW biscuit. I find INW biscuit to kind of become more and more noticeable after a steep to a point where its gross, JF biscuit has not had that affect on me. (i'd stay between .5-3%)\n\nI sub this for INW biscuit across the board and it works just as well, if not better, every damn time. (Usually at the same %) \n\nReally tasty with strawberry, I subbed JF for INW to make [this recipe]( https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/5rm236/podgy_a_crispy_cookie_stick_with_a_sweet_pink/) and it turned out fantastic\n\n\n**Pairings**: Cookies/Cheesecakes/Bakery Stuff, Berries, Creams, Custards, Chocolate, Nuts, Tobacco, Caramel, probably a bunch more things I’m forgetting.\n\n**Notes**: Works as a shake and vape, but I like it more after 2-3 days. Everything evens out and its just delicious. It’s kind of what I had hoped INW biscuit would be back when I first began mixing. I was put off by it though and avoided recipes that called for biscuit. INW biscuit is too dry for me and strange tasting especially after chain vaping. I am very thankful that JF answered my prayers on this one. \n\n\n**Second Opinions**\n\n/u/Trevorxgage  called it the [INW biscuit killer](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/583wf0/recipe_thankful_donut_and_a_new_donut_base/)  and I must agree \n\nExcellent reviews on [ECX](http://www.ecigexpress.com/shop/diy-e-liquid/diy-e-liquid-flavors/jungle-flavors/biscuit-by-jungle-flavors.html), the only place to buy this that I know of.\n\nOne note on ELR says “good stuff, like it slightly more than [INW biscuit](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/114089)\n","author":"HashSlingingSlashur","title":"Biscuit","url":"https://redd.it/5w1416","vendor":{"name":"Jungle Flavors","code":"JF"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"JF","title":"Biscuit"}},
