Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Clove @ .25%. 60/40 VG/PG, steeped 9 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Do you actually like cloves? Like, really like cloves? This is cloves.  Pretty damn analogous to FLV Rich Cinnamon in that it's bold, ridiculously strong, way too expensive, and pretty great. More of a djarum clove kind of flavor solo, instead of a softer baked or mulled clove. Has a bit of a drier texture and almost wood-spice kind warmth that mimics smoking clove cigarettes fairly well.  Flavor settles in after a while, but it avoids getting sour and thin like FA Clove or chemical-ish like TFA Clove.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Nah. I mean, it's a bit dry? That doesn't seem like an off-flavor for cloves though.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Nothing weird, but it's a strong clove flavor, so you'll definitely feel it.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  The super obvious one is tobacco pairing. The spicy warmth here is going to work really well with a non-green kind of tobacco flavor.  Maybe throw in some vanilla, and you are definitely approaching clove cigarettes.\n\nFor a bakery clove, you'll want to work with a dilution, as this will stomp anything too subtle unless you use a really light hand.  This could totally work as your bakery clove, though.  Works well with drier and nutty bakeries.\n\nFruit parings, I like cloves with bananas and oranges... but follow your bliss here and work with a dilution.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nConcentration testing, this is strong stuff.  At .25% I get a very rich, full clove flavor.  You may be able to work this with tobaccos up to about .5%.  Solo, flavorah suggests 1-2% but that seems crazy to me.  If you're working outside of tobaccos you will absolutely have to do a 10% of dilution, then start at 1% and work up.\n\nSo this is expensive. Like $12.49 for 15ml.  I can't imagine ever actually using the entire bottle though. It's that strong.  I picked a 5ml from gremlin for $6 and I'm pretty sure that'll last me for a couple of years.\n\nReally good stuff. Totally the rich cinnamon of the clove world.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[So i finally took the plunge on picking this one up after reading /u/shrine399/ 's report about the owner of flavorah talked about how underrated this flavor is.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/3pk3t9/tfa_clove/)  After finally getting on the Rich Cinnamon hype train, I took the plunge.\n\n[Some usage tips here, mostly just make a dilution.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/3roj7c/taming_of_the_clove/)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Clove","url":"https://redd.it/5veczm","vendor":{"name":"Flavorah","code":"FLV"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FLV","title":"Clove"}},
