Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** HS Beer @ 3%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 15 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Moderately sweet lightly roasted malted grain with a strong brandy like booziness to it.  Straight malt liquor. A malted base or fermented grape flavor to build on.  Solo, this is a lot like vaping a warm tall can of Steel Reserve.\n\nInhale is sour, with almost lambic hints of dark berries. Exhale is again slightly sour, with a moderate amount of lightly roasted malted grain.  It's definitely lightly roasted, like a blonde or pale.  I get just a subtle hint of caramel, unlike something deeper like an amber or even a stout.  Not really nutty enough for a straight barley, more like a corn blend that you get from macro beers.  The \"fermented\" part here is prominent and boozy, tasting a good deal like a brandy instead of a corn mash type of whiskey flavor with some white grape or deep apple notes to it.  I don't get any yeasty or piney hop notes here.  The dirtier fermentation and brandy notes start to drag this into malt liquor territory.  Builds into steel reserve on your palate pretty quick.  You get that brandy funk and sweatiness sticking around for a bit.  Moderate density vapor.  Sweetness feels pretty natural throughout the exhale, but it again makes you think of malt liquor.\n\n**Off-flavors:** No plastic or rubber notes, no pronounced \"chemical\" notes, or anything outright out of place.  Not too sure what else to call an off flavor here.\n\n**Throat Hit:** None? It feels weird to say, but this pretty smooth.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:** So, you're going to have to think outside the box here.\n\nSince there is no hops or other bitterness, I'd reccomend FLV Yakima Hopps if you want a fuller beer flavor.  You're also going to need something for some juiciness and water down that brandy funk, so a small percentage of CAP Cucumber or INW Cactus. Sweetness might be an issue, so FA Bitter Wizard is going to be your friend.\n\nPeople have also been cramming fruit in beers forever.  Dark berries are pretty common. Citruses are also way up there.  You then have radlers/shandies that are beer mixes with juices (especially lemonade) or ginger ale.  The brandy notes here take me more in the berry direction, but you could pull off citrus if you balanced it right.  In the same vein, people also add a lot of spices and florals into beers.  Since those tend to be pretty aggresive concentrates, balancing the recipe will be an issue. \n\nFermented malt flavor and brandy would probably be better in hard cider flavors.  FA Fuji/JF Fuji or even better FLV Apple Cider with this would take you most of the way to a boozy apple cider.\n\nThe roasted malt with aggressive brandy overtones could also have some use in more savory bakeries, although we are talking small percentages here and someone much smarter than me to figure it out.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nSo the concentration here is going to be key.  At .5-1% you get most of the malt with just a bit of than brandy note.  That hint of the brandy note is kind of thin and astringent though, so it almost comes across as cheaper and gnarlier tasting.  2% is right about the sweet spot, where that malt is still there, and the booze comes across as something more like a high abv slightly syrupy darker beer, as opposed to straight malt liquor or cheap beer.  3% or over will literally make you homeless.\n\nSo, novelty value aside, this is still pretty odd. I can't think of any other concentrates going after this profile and so it's kind of the only game in town. It's definitely not a good beer concentrate on it's own, but it may have some use if you are commited to chasing the specific profile.  Just expect to do a lot of work with it to get the good stuff out of it without crossing into tall cans and regret territory.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nNope.
