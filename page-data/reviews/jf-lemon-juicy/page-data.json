It's not necessarily tart, or bitter, or acidic; just a straight up sweet lemon flavor. It's almost reminiscent of those lemon drop candies, but less artificial tasting. I can see this working very well in bakeries, candies, and beverage flavors. The first place my palate wants to take this is like a lemon meringue pie. I've tried this at 1%, 3%, and 5%. 3% seems to be the cap, 1% was a little too weak, and 5% I didn't get anything extra out of it than I did at 3%. This flavoring oughtn't need to steep as it's a fruit, seems to be low in acids, and has an inherent sweetness about it.  \n\n**Single Flavor Testing Notes**  \n\n*5/29\nshake-n-vape* \n\nRight away I notice Juicy Lemon doesn't seem to cloud up a mix like FA Lemon Sicily or other citruses, possibly due to a lower citric acid content.  \n\nOn the nose I get kind of a sweet lemon, almost reminiscent of those lemon drop candies.  \n\n@3% this is a really nice lemon flavor. It's not bitter or tart or anything just straight lemon. Sweet too, almost like a lemon candy but not artificial.  \n\n@5% not gaining anything extra from it than I did at 3% so I'm thinking 3% is going to be a cap for this flavoring  \n\n@1% The lemon is just barely there, not prominent enough to be noticeable even in a mix methinks. \n","author":"CheebaSteeba","title":"Lemon Juicy","url":"https://redd.it/4lk0bi","vendor":{"name":"Jungle Flavors","code":"JF"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"JF","title":"Lemon Juicy"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
