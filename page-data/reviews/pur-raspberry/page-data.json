Juicy and refreshing without any off or perfume flavors, I can almost taste the berry bursting in my mouth. Not overly sweetened nor artificial at all. Very, very good. Compared to other flavors, I think this is closest to INW Raspberry with it's realistic flavors, but without the slightly bitter/perfume I can sometimes taste with INW. Compared to TFA Sweet Raspberry, this is not as sweet and artificial and doesn't taste like candy at all. I would positively buy this before either of them.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:** None\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit:** 2/10\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Pairings:** Apples, other berries. Cookies, cakes, creams, pastries, custards, nuts, chocolate, jams or jellies, cobbler, oats, vanilla.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Notes:** Great at 7% for a SF, I am thinking 1.5-3% for blends.","author":"mysticrosell","title":"Raspberry","url":"https://redd.it/5mx6ma","vendor":{"name":"Purilum","code":"PUR"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"PUR","title":"Raspberry"}},
