Now you can satisfy your juicy melon cravings any time…without the seeds. Crisp, mouthwatering flavor will soak your senses!\n\n**Flavor description**: Wow, first impression is this stuff is incredibly sweet. This is possibly the sweetest flavor I've ever vaped. Not in a bad way. This stuff tastes exactly like eating some watermelon sour patch kids. The sweetness isn't artificially chemical tasting. Almost get the feeling of it lingering on your lips. This is definitely a candy watermelon flavor but the best damn one I've tried yet. Nothing like a real tasting watermelon as they described. No rind notes or anything outside of just a straight watermelon candy. No chemical or artificial off putting notes either. It has almost a gummy flavor to it without actually being able to taste anything gummy related. It has a lingering moist and juicy taste to it not like that dryness you get from LA and TFA Watermelon. Similar to the effect you get from INW Cactus. I'm getting some sour at the end of the exhale. It's not that noticeable but it's there. For how simple a flavor like this they hit every single note to make a very \"authentic\" artificial tasting candy watermelon flavor. Colored me surprised on how delicious this flavor is.\n\nThis seems to be more of a PDO dominate flavor. I'm making the assumption that they are putting PDO in there. They do sell concentrates based in PDO. I'm picking up no alcohol flavors or harshness. The viscosity appears to be inline with a semi diluted PG type flavor. I could be wrong here so take it with a grain of salt.\n\n**Throat hit**: Nothing of note/ incredibly smooth\n\n**Off-flavors**: Nothing outside of a candy watermelon\n\n**Uses**: .5%-1% seems to be a good starting point for more of a background note or going against some lighter fruits.  1.5%-2% for the top note. Going this high with it might make the sweetness over bearing/sickly sweet. I can see this being very useful for adding sweetness in lower percentages in candy recipes that seem to lack that 'brightness' you want. This will pull anything you make into more of a candy profile. This could, in a lot of recipes, be exchanged for LA Watermelon at, obviously, a lower percentage as this does it better IMO. Mixing this with a light non-dairy cream such as TFA Whipped cream would be good if you want to try to take it into a sherbet flavor because of the shear amount of sweetness this has.\n\n**Rating**: 9/10\n\nI'm rating this high because it is what I hoped LA/TFA Watermelon was. This flavor is exactly what I have been wanting from a candy watermelon profile. It's concentrated and right in your face. Will have many uses around a fruit/candy type profile without having to go up to 9% to achieve it.\n\n**Second Opinions**: \n\n> [ELR](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/114919) - Mixed at 2.5% and let it sit a week. This is pretty authentic watermelon flavor. It reminds me of summer months eating fresh watermelon. It's sweet and juicy! I think that 2.5% is probably a little high and would be better at 1.5-2%. Overall it is still a really good watermelon flavor. \n> \n> Preferred single flavor mix: 2.0%\n\n \n","author":"chewymidget","title":"Watermelon SC","url":"https://redd.it/5zum53","vendor":{"name":"Real Flavors","code":"RF"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"RF","title":"Watermelon SC"}},
