Slightly sweet, light vanilla but it lacks that cakey-ness that something like JF yellow cake has. Reminds me more of box vanilla bean cake than a box yellow cake, not far away from the taste of these without butter: https://www.amazon.com/Trader-Joes-Vanilla-Cake-Baking/dp/B00DZDHBBK \nCompared to JF yellow cake, this one has less body and is slightly less concentrated.\n\n**Off-flavors**: Nothing to note.\n\n**Throat hit**: Smooth, nothing.\n\n**Uses**: I have actually never used FW yellow cake, I have used both this and JF yellow cake as subs. I find this one to work quite well as a substitute for FW, in the recipes that call for FW I use it at a 1:1 ratio. I’ve used it in many popular mixes that call for FW and all ended up fantastic. \n\nThis could be used as the base of a cake/cupcake/muffin recipe at 4-6%.\n\n(I am of thinking using this and JF yellow cake in a 2:1 ratio (CAP:JF) for a cake base.)\n\nThis can be used as an additive like FW yellow cake from 1-2%\n\n**Pairings**: Creams, bakeries, fruits, cereals, caramel, butterscotch, nuts, cinnamon and some spices, almost anything that pairs with vanilla or somewhere to add moist/airy mouthfeel. \n\n**Notes**: As a shake and vape the flavor is great, not noticing a huge change from day 1 to day 7 or day 30 for that matter. This is not a strong or overbearing flavor to begin with and doesn’t get much more pronounced or mellow with time passage. Maybe it’s just me but I get vanilla here so that could limit pairings somewhat.\n\n**Second Opinions**\n\n[Some people on ELR like it, others say at 10 and 15% no flavor]( http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/123437)\n\n[Mostly good stuff on Bull City, except one guy who likes FW, nothing on ECX]( http://www.bullcityflavors.com/yellow-cake-cap/)\n\n/u/Arpeggiator8472 says it’s the [FW yellow cake killer](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/58l48m/cap_yellow_cake/) i can't agree because i've never had FW but i agree through him.\n\n\n/u/xxoonn uses it in a [nice looking donut]( https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/5i4i59/the_chocolate_glazed_doughnut/)\n\ncoop also utilizes it for a [yummy cinnamon roll]( https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/25482#simply_rollin_by_coop34)\n\npretty versatile ingredient and it's being utilized more and more from what I see","author":"HashSlingingSlashur","title":"Yellow Cake","url":"https://redd.it/5vffe1","vendor":{"name":"Capella","code":"CAP"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"CAP","title":"Yellow Cake"}},
