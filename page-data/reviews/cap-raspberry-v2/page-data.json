Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** CAP Raspberry v2 @ 1%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 31 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Unpleasantly floral raspberry. Base raspberry taste is like INW Raspberry, but quite a bit weaker and a lot more floral.\n\nInhale is warm and floral. Some syrupy raspberry, but the bitter florals are making it read robitussin-y.  Exhale definitely leads floral with some flashes of a greener note. Syrupy, warm, raspberry base. Has that thing that INW Raspberry has where it kind of tastes like a blow-pop that's already been in someone's mouth.  Overall vape is moderately dense, although the florals make the entire thing taste fairly light. Lingering bitterness from those florals, reads almost medicinal.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Very floral to the point of being bitter and medicinal. Some higher green astringent notes in there too.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Light, nothing too major.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Because the actual raspberry here is so similar to INW Raspberry but with the added floral drawbacks, I'm not seeing an actual situation where this would be my first choice.  I've had issues mixing with this just because those green and floral notes tend to dominate whatever you put it in.  I personally haven't had any success with it, although you could probably press it into service wherever you'd want a raspberry, probably with a huge wollop of cream or a softer fruit base like FA Pear to soften it quite a bit.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nS&V concentration testing, 1% is weak. Florals are under control, but their isn't all that much raspberry there.  Pretty flat and cardboardish. 2% is still floral forward with some realtively weak syrupy raspberry candy behind it.  3% is heavily floral, but that raspberry is getting more pronounced. 4% and 5% are pretty much the same. The raspberry and the florals seems to be scaling up at about the same rate. \n\nIt's been a while since I've had Capella Raspberry v1, but I this doesn't seem drastically different than my previous experience. My notes on it were very brief and talked about a syrupy raspberry that went way too floral.  I figured I'd give the v2 a shot because I'm a big fan of raspberry and figured it could be decent.  I'd personally avoid this one, although it would make a decent sub if you can't get the CAP Raspberry v1 for whatever reason.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Some comparison between v1 and v2](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/3kebew/cap_raspberry_v1_vs_v2/)\n\n[Not a lot of help on ELR, some people calling it fresh tasting, some people calling it candy.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/17649)\n\nCouple glowing reviews on [ECX](http://www.ecigexpress.com/diy-e-liquid/diy-e-liquid-flavors/capella-flavor-drops/raspberry-v2-capella-flavor-drops.html#review-list) and [BCF](http://www.bullcityflavors.com/raspberry-v2-cap/). Can't say as I agree, but YMMV.\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)** ","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Raspberry V2","url":"https://redd.it/5tjbkb","vendor":{"name":"Capella","code":"CAP"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"CAP","title":"Raspberry V2"}},
