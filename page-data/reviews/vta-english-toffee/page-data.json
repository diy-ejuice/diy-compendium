At low percentages this would make an ideal sweetener for desserts, bakery based recipes. At higher percentages it can be widely used in candy style ejuice recipes. A definite must have flavour to bring sweetness to your recipes or simple mix as a single profile mix and enjoy on its own.\" They suggest mixed 2-4% solo 5-10%.\n\n**Notes:** When I tested it freshly mixed it had a bit of chemical note too it, but after 14 days it has steeped out. It's a pretty straight forward flavor. The main note is a fairly sweet toffee with some creaminess. Wasn't much throat hit or harshness to speak of. The creaminess gave it a smooth decent bodied mouthfeel. \n\n**Pairings** Bakeries, cream, tobacco, & candies. Could be used at a low percentage along side of VT Toffee Ice Cream to boost the overall toffee note.
