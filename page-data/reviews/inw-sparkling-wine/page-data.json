And I feel as though I'm getting a light background Apple flavor.\n\n**Relatable Flavors** \n\nReminds me of my grandmother's homemade grape juice, with just a little extra fizz.             \n\n**Off Flavors** \n\nNothing really off here the syrupy aspect does leave a slight\naftertaste but not unpleasant, and there is no alcohol warmth coming from this flavor which I expected from the name.\n\n**Position In The Recipe** \n\nBase, if you're looking to make a grape anything. Should work well as an accent brightening up other fruits along with adding sweetness, and when using with creams believe it will come out as a top note.\n\n**Pairings** \n\nFruits, berries, tropical fruits, and savory flavors.\n\n**Notes**\nIn my opinion this is more of a grape flavoring.\n\n   http://www.ecigexpress.com/diy-e-liquid/browse-flavorings/beverage-flavors/sparkling-wine-by-inawera-10ml.html\n\n**Recipe**    \n\nhttps://alltheflavors.com/recipes/6735\n\n**Rating** 90/100            \n                   \n*Please if your opinion differs, or you have another review for this post it in the comments.
