    "result": {"data":{"reviewsJson":{"markdown":"**Setup:** Recoil w/ flavor barrel, Dual 15 wrap 26g 3mm Nifethal 70 coils @.17 ohms.  60w power, 450F temp limit. Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** INW Shisha Mango @ 2%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 11 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** An underipe mango.  No real juice or flesh in there.\n\nInhale is a mostly nuetral sweetness.  Some deep mango notes, but pretty indistinct.  Exhale is all underripe mango.  Sweeter than an actual underripe mango though. Grassy peel through the entire exhale. Not quite as perfumey as you'd think all those top notes would be.  Very top end of that peel tastes more like rubber than pine.  Moderate sweetness, moderately thin mouthfeel.  Tears up your mouth just a tiny bit with extended use.  Feels a bit a bit acidic.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Grassy peel notes finish rubbery, like a fresh set of tires.\n\n**Throat Hit:** 2/10. Top quality rubber.\n\n**Uses:**  I'd stick to low percentages for mango top notes in a tropical fruit mix.  Maybe to give a mango perfume to a sweeter, heavier cream-based recipe.  Definitely not a solo flavor.\n\n**Pairings:**  Deep, juicy, fruits.  FLV Mango or CAP Sweet Mango would work.  Probably CAP Golden Pineapple as well.  Something that could benefit from some top notes.\n\n**Notes:**  Pretty convincing underripe mango, for whatever that's worth. It's going to be another mango that needs a lot of help getting where it's going.\n\nThat rubber is way too strong at 2%.  I received the sample pre-mixed, so my S&V concentration testing is just based on cutting that back with more base.  With that said, 2% is definitely on the high end of where you want to use this.  \n\nThe top notes seem to scale with the percentage here. 1% is intense, and that rubber taste is still loud and clear.  It actually may be a bit more distracting without the extra sweetness there.  This is pretty faint all around at .5% but still distinct.  S&V mixing with sweet mango @ 2% and shisha mango @ .5%, and it's providing decent top notes except for that rubber taste.  Personally, I'd skip it.\n\nShoutout to /u/apexified for the sample.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nAll over the place on this one.\n\n[u/diyvaping/ seems to enjoy it quite a bit more than I do.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/5cyhho/inawera_mango_flavor_tastes_like_nasty_caramel/da25pwi/)\n\n[u/nicobeak/ calls it bright as hell, while not actually resembling a mango.  Too astringent and it stands out too much.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/4chv8f/mango_meringue_mm_recipe/)\n\n[Annnnd user Willbo on Vaping Underground says almost exactly the opposite!](http://vapingunderground.com/threads/inawera-must-haves.207273/page-3)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Shisha Mango","url":"https://redd.it/5gwubu","vendor":{"name":"Inawera","code":"INW"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"INW","title":"Shisha Mango"}},
