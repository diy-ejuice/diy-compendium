In the back I can taste just light hints of bright fruit. Moderately sweet with a hint of vanilla, this is a very decent cream flavor. I think this would mix great with anything fruity, and the background fruity notes might compliment or enhance other fruits? I am hoping it will strengthen with a longer steep.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Steep Time:** 6 Weeks\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis becomes much creamier with steeping. It has developed to become a very nice cream with a creamy mouth feel that wasn't present at the earlier steep. The fruits have developed slightly but not much. I get a very light taste of orange and pineapple, but it was so light I couldn't recognize it without looking up the description for the flavor. Just an overall generic tasting brighter fruit at this percentage. I actually like it, it's pleasant, but not quite strong enough for a SF. I am going to mix this at 20% and see if the flavor gets deeper, as it does taste good as is, just way too under flavored. However, I don't usually mix anything that high, so this is a weaker flavor overall. It's great at 15% if going for a cream, but not if you want the fruit and cream. I would start this at 4-8% as an accent flavor. At this point I'm going to say 20% single flavor?\n&nbsp;","author":"mysticrosell","title":"Dreamsicle VG Version","url":"https://redd.it/55sjp9","vendor":{"name":"Real Flavors","code":"RF"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"RF","title":"Dreamsicle VG Version"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
