I'm picking up a light cookie/crust note but nothing in the way of graham cracker. It's also very creamy for a cracker flavor. Really strange tbh. Reminds me of a coconut macaroon or something like that. Taking a whiff of the bottle, yeah its like a coconut cookie aroma. Taking a look at the component list on [TPA website](http://shop.perfumersapprentice.com/componentlist.aspx?sku_search=17242) the first ingredient listed is 6-Methyl Coumarin which, you guessed it, tastes like sweet coconut.  \n\n\n**Recommended Pairings**\n\nCoconut cream pie. Yeah this is like halfway there already. This would go great with any coconut flavor. I could see this working to help out key lime pies or something like that, its got the cream and a tiny bite of cracker thing on the back end. This would pair well with:\n\n* almond\n* banana\n* caramel\n* spices (cinnamon or cardamom)\n* nuts\n* chocolate\n* creams/custards\n* tropical fruits (thinking pineapple/mango)\n* honey\n* maple\n* some citrus (thinking lemon or lime)\n* rum\n* peanut butter\n* tea, especially green\n* vanilla\n\n\n**Off Notes** \n\nthe whole thing. its a creamy yet toasted coconut flavor.\n\n\n**Notes**\n\nAside from this being completely off, I kind of like it. Even solo at this %, its creamy and somewhat complex. I will be using this eventually...\n\nI'd keep this one between 2-5% depending how much coconut cookie thing you want.\n\n\n**Second Opinions**\n\nSomeone on [ELR](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/74502) says it tastes like cardboard, I could see that maybe at 5%+ but here it tastes fine. Not the greatest coconut flavor out there but its better than TFA's other coconuts imo. \n\nSomeone raved about this on [BCF](http://www.bullcityflavors.com/dx-graham-cracker-tfa/) but nothing specific about it. They just say mixed with FA cookie and biscuit for an amazing vape. I'm sure they aren't wrong actually, could be pretty damn good. \n\nNot a lot on this sub about this one that's why I decided to do a review. \n\n\n\n*Thanks for reading and please leave any notes you may have about this weird ass flavor.*\n\n\nSoon to come: my review about FE Avocado! \n\n\nedit just some formatting\n\n\n\n**BTW the most authentic graham cracker I have found is CAP graham cracker v2, its got all the right spices. needs some more crunch but its there and its good. So if you came here looking for a graham cracker, go get it!**","author":"HashSlingingSlashur","title":"Graham Cracker DX","url":"https://redd.it/6ix4ps","vendor":{"name":"The Flavor Apprentice","code":"TFA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"TFA","title":"Graham Cracker DX"}},
