Moderately dense I give it a 4 out of 10. No throat hit.                                             \n\n**Flavor Properties**- Sweet syrup like chocolate light with none of the creaminess  that I've been getting from other chocolates. On the upside no chalky flavor this is a bittersweet chocolate with the emphasis on sweet.\n\n**Relatable Flavors** - Taste like something I would use if I was trying to make a chocolate sucker or Jolly Rancher.\n\n**Off Flavors** - I've already hit this 3 times and maybe it's intentional,syrupy flavor almost cough medicine like, ( without it being really gross )and a         lingering aftertaste.\n\n**Position In The Recipe** - Moderately dense leaves me to believe this is going to best serve other chocolates as an accent. ( hopefully helping get rid of that chalky mouthfeel flavor )       \n\n**Pairings** - Other chocolate, creams, bakeries, tobacco's, dark berries, and a few fruits like apple. ( I'm curious to try it with a little  fa cantaloupe )","author":"Chrisdvr1","title":"OMFG It's Chocolate","url":"https://redd.it/4nmfma","vendor":{"name":"Nude Nicotine","code":"NN"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"NN","title":"OMFG It's Chocolate"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
