Not at all unpleasant just unexpected.\n\n**Position In The Recipe**\n\n 5% should make a fantastic candy base . Lower percentages should accent other candies such as butterscotch or caramel, and  take the top note position in any ice cream or creamy recipe.    \n\n**Pairings** \n\nOther candies, bakeries, tobacco's, creams, dark berries, and vanilla's.   \n\n**Notes** \n\nI pick this one up from Vaporstek one of the most highly rated flavorings on their website, thought it was an interesting profile. I think this could easily replace caramel or butterscotch and almost any recipe with little or no change to percentages.  \n\n\nhttp://www.vaperstek.org/toffee-aroma-flavor/\n\nhttps://sites.duke.edu/dukeresearch/2013/01/23/cooking-up-chemistry-with-candy/\n\n**Rating** 95/100\n\n*Please if your opinion differs, or you have another review for this post it in the comments.
