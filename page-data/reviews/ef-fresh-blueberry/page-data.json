{"componentChunkName":"component---src-components-review-js","path":"/reviews/ef-fresh-blueberry","result":{"data":{"reviewsJson":{"markdown":"**Flavor description from EuroFlavor:** *None*\n\n**Percentages Tested:** 2%, 3%, and 4%\n\n**Testing Setup:** Recurve RDA with a four-wrap SS316L single clapton at 0.33 ohms. Cotton wicks. 30 watts.\n\n**Flavor Notes:** This is a blueberry that seems to be in it's own category. Up front, there's a strong taste of sweet blueberry skins which is kinda pleasant and unpleasant at the same time. This really leans towards a fresh blueberry fruit rather than a candy or baked blueberry, and it has somewhat of a floral dynamic going on. There's a small amount of fleshy body on the exhale, but overall, this isn't a very heavy flavor. It's sweet without being cloying or artificial- a very naturally sweet fruit flavor. There's a slight bitterness that kind of sticks to the roof of my mouth on the exhale, and it creates this weird medicinal note which is off-putting after a while. There's no tartness to be found.\n\nOverall, I feel like there's a better selection of blueberries out there, but I don't feel like this flavor is a complete dud by any means. If you want a reliable workhorse blueberry flavor, this probably isn't it. However, if you're into florals, you'd enjoy playing around with this. I also think it could work fairly well in beverages. It could add a nice blueberry-flavored touch without altering texture or making things too syrupy and heavy. If you've had RF Blueberry SC, this tastes similar but not as hollow or empty.\n\nThe light flavor is really going to prevent this from being used as a base note. I'd start using this at 1-2% if you wanted to add a blueberry accent, and I'd shoot for around 3-3.5% for a more noticeable blueberry flavor without any off notes. At 4% or higher, you're going to have to battle some bitterness.
