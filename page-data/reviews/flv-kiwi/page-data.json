Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Kiwi @ 1% and 1 drop per 10 ml (about .25%), 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 8 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  If you told me this was some kind of cantaloupe or a funkier muskmelon flavor, I'd believe you. It's interesting. I get a creamy texture, with a heavy musk to it, and a very deep melon-y sweetness.  Not necessarily too different from a kiwi sweetness, but it's definitely trending towards a softer cantaloupe as opposed to the brighter kiwi that leans a bit towards honeydew. There's a bit of tartness in the back half of the exhale, but it's subtle and competing with some serious floral notes and some ammonia especially up at 1%.  Overall, it seems like it's going to be a fairly difficult flavor to mix, and It's not really conjuring up a kiwi for me.  It's also crazy strong, bordering on overwhelming by .2%.\n\nInhale is a bit airy up top, but theres a sharp floral note. Base is a little denser, fairly netural but it has a creamier density. Not a lot of actual flavor here, but some tartness that kind of seems like it fits in with a kiwi. Exhale has a deeper sweet base and a creamy texture. y melon-y with a bit of a brighter, tarter kiwi in there. Top notes here are really assertive, with a musky almost floral taste and some pretty noticeable ammonia. Lingering bitterness and ammonia, at least at .25%.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  There's not much here that really makes me think of kiwi. I've got a creaminess, a heavy floral note, and a bit of ammonia to it.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Not really?  The floral edge can get harsh, but that's mostly over .5% and not really where I'd want to be mixing this.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I've been trying to get this to work to add some of the musky rind back into a cantaloupe with decidedly mixed results. I keep banging my head on it, but the balance between a pleasant musk and full on floral and ammonia with this seems really tricky.  Theoretically it should work, because this has a pretty spot on deep sweetness for a cantaloupe, and the creaminess should work really well for a ripe melon texture, that floral note is just a bit too prominent. My last test was at .2% behind 1.25% FLV Canteloupe, and it's still coming on a bit strong.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nLess is definitely more with this. FWIW, This is definitely isn't a S&V concentrate.  I made a dilution to test this.  .05% seems a bit light, and it's a bit hard to pick out. .1% is definitely present, with some melon style creaminess and a lighter musk note.  At .15% I can start to barely get some ammonia on the backend of this, and that musky note is getting a bit floral. .2% is a bit too floral, and that ammonia is distracting. .25% is just not working for me, with a clear floral edge and some of that ammonia. 1% is not a good time.\n\nIt's hard not to feel like I'm a bit off on the melon thing, but this is a bit of an oddball concentrate. As always, second opinions and experience with this flavor is hugely appreciated.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nNah, not really.\n\n[Here's the Flavorah broduct page. Their description: \"Aromatic and tropical ripe Kiwi. This is the soft green and white flesh of the fruit, with less of the astringent rind. This is a flavor that really comes out after mixing, steeping, and vaping. \"](http://store.flavorah.com/concentrated-kiwi-flavor)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Kiwi","url":"https://redd.it/6c716l","vendor":{"name":"Flavorah","code":"FLV"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FLV","title":"Kiwi"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
