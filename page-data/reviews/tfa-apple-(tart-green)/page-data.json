Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** TPA Apple (Green Tart), 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 6 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Tart green apple top notes. No real body.  Doesn't quite feel like a full flavor, at least the tested percentages. It's missing anything crisp, juicy, fleshy or any other mouthfeel elements you'd expect with an apple. For being just the top notes, it's fairly realistic but a bit nondescript.\n\nOn the bright side, this doesn't have most of the baggage that usually shows up with green apple flavors. Manages to avoid tasting like green apple jolly ranchers.  It's not really candy sweet.\n\nThere's also a pretty solid tartness here without an aggressive sour or acidic note.  [Admittedly, the component list for this looks suspiciously short, but it doesn't include any malic or citric acid.](http://shop.perfumersapprentice.com/componentlist.aspx?sku_search=71100315)\n\nLight grassy, acetone note to this, but it isn't super prominent relative to the tartness.\n\nThis feels a lot more like a tool to turn apples green than a full green apple flavor.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Some of the usual suspects for green apple flavors, but not as overwhelming as some other concentrates.  Grassy, bordering on acetone chemical note.  Closer to just straight grassy, but there is a little bit of a more bitter chemical edge.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Fairly harsh.  It isn't unbearable, but it's definitely a bit much as a solo flavor.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  Concentration testing solo is a bit weird, because it doesn't really have a full apple flavor underneath it.\n\nTesting this at 1%, it has some noticeable tartness and a bit of grassiness. It doesn't really evoke green apples at this percentage, but it doesn't feel out of place.\n\nAt 2%, It's now tasting more apple-esque, but still just the top notes. Tartness hasn't really increased, but it is a bit more grassy and green. harshness also seems to be picking up.\n\nAt 3%, It's getting harsher and the thinness coupled with that grassiness is a bit strange.  More identifiable green apple.\n\nAt 4%, the harshness is pretty overwhelming, at least solo.  Also starting to taste a bit more like acetone and it's getting slightly bitter.\n\nAt 6%, it's harshy, bitter, and grassy.\n\nI'd use this an accent to a juicier, fuller apple concentrate between 1.5-3% depending on how sharp of a green apple top note you'd like.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Again, this feels like it's TPA's version of just the part of an apple flavor that makes it green.  This is just one of TPA's green apple flavors, but looking at the component lists, [TPA Apple (Tart Granny Smith)](http://shop.perfumersapprentice.com/componentlist.aspx?sku_search=343135) lists 16 components not including water, ethyl alcohol, and propylene glycol, [TPA Green Apple](http://shop.perfumersapprentice.com/componentlist.aspx?sku_search=309457) lists 19, and this [has 2.](http://shop.perfumersapprentice.com/componentlist.aspx?sku_search=71100315)\n\nI'd use this with a juicier apple, like one of the fujis, to pull it closer to a realistic green apple. Something like TPA Dragonfruit would probably help emulsify and blend the flavors even further.\n\nYou could probably also use it with the apple blend flavors like INW Two Apples to add more tart green apple.\n\nThis may have some use to enhance tartness in fruit mixes without adding too identifiable of a green apple note.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  Not a whole lot easily searchable about this.  This is relatively new on BCF, so maybe it's a newer flavor.\n\n[Here is the ELR Page, but only a couple of short notes. User \"JonDelves\" is quoting someone named \"Robert\": \"nice crisp apple taste not bitter like some or to sweet like others as soon has you open the bottle you get the smell of apple.\" User \"aldykuzut\" writes: \"TFA version is better than capella green apple, mixing with FA Fuji apple to get authentic apple flavor. preferred mixing at 1.5 - 2% and 6% for single flavor use.\"  User \"Hollywood VApes\" writes: \"Mine tastes like alcohol or something and was taking forever to steep out. Once it did it was good like a green apple jolly rancher type flavor, but I have been using Cap green apple and I think it has similar issues but didn't take as long to steep.\"](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/630)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Apple (Tart Green)","url":"https://redd.it/6ym7zv","vendor":{"name":"The Flavor Apprentice","code":"TFA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"TFA","title":"Apple (Tart Green)"}},
