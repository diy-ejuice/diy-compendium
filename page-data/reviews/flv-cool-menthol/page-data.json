Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Cool Menthol @ Various, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 5 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  It's menthol, more or less. I don't really pick up much going on here besides the menthol.  It's smooth and pretty concentrated, but it's a $7.49 bottle of menthol... so there's that.  .25% is fairly strong, but still pleasant and it just takes off from there.  Seems to be somewhere around 2 or 3 times stronger than a normal 10% menthol solution.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Normal menthol off-flavors at higher percentages.  A bit less chemical and bitter than other menthols I've tried, but still has a grassy note if you overdo it.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Standard menthol throat hit. Icy bite on inhale and exhale, no added harshness when used low. I get a bit of light chemical edge when mixing with a heavy hand, but it seems a little less pronounced than my generic menthol at equivalent levels of cooling.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:** Yeah, it's just menthol.  In general, better for mints and fruits than anything involving creams or bakeries. If you do want some coolness in a cream, like for a milkshake, look at Koolada instead, which is more subtle and lives more in the exhale.\n\n**Notes:**  Again, this feels fairly concentrated. My usual menthol is just a bottle of Wizard Labs 10% menthol solution, and this feels at least twice as strong.  Concentration testing was done in a mix with 1% FLV Cranberry. .25% is definitely noticeable. Just a menthol coolness.  .5% is a solid menthol. Deeper coolness but still no harsh bite. I'm start to get some bitter, slightly grassy menthol flavor in there as well.  It's still subtle here, but noticeable.  At 1%, I'm getting a bit of bite and a more pronounced menthol flavor on top of the icyness. The slightly grassy taste is getting a little vegetal and a there is a bit of sting to it. I still don't pick up a clear mint or anything like that. Worth nothing that 1% caused some crystallization in the bottle.  I mixed 10ml in a 15ml glass bottle, and the head space had some visible crystalization where the juice had been up on the sides and fell back down.  Menthol is pretty subjective, but I think it'll work better closer to .25% here.  I'm not a huge fan of overly mentholated juices, but at 1% it feels closer to my 10% menthol solution at 2.5 or 3%.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[The semi-illustrious \"deleted user\": \"At 2% exhibits pleasant wintergreen flavor with a good bit of chill. Not quite the impact of Koolada or Ice but definitely cold. Chill impact more nasal rather than back of throat as with ECX Menthol.  Fine solo as a wintergreen vape. Should be nice for allergy season. Try with mints and the usual suspects.\"  I don't get the wintergreen nuance they are talking about, and I don't really see how you need 2% of this stuff.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/32o3wy/my_flv_tasting_notes_cool_menthol/)\n\n[A couple notes on ELR. One is a copy of the above, the other says this is too strong at 1.5%.  I'm going to agree.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/33050)\n\n[Heres the product page from Flavorah.  They seem to be promoting outdoor nudity: \"Ice cold and refreshing. Vaping this flavor is like sliding down a glacier into a lake and stepping out in the buff with a strong wind. A standard flavor for anyone making their own eliquid. This mixes well with any fruit flavor for a refreshing fruit taste.\"](http://store.flavorah.com/concentrated-cool-menthol-flavor)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Cool Menthol","url":"https://redd.it/65g1id","vendor":{"name":"Flavorah","code":"FLV"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FLV","title":"Cool Menthol"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
