The menthol note is very smooth here and not overpowering in anyway. I get a slight hint of chocolate from it, but it's very mellow. The texture is slightly crisp and full. The mint is not super forward, and the chocolatey-creaminess of this makes me feel it would work well in a base or toward the middle range of a receipe. Overall this flavoring is very nice, and works well by itself. I haven't tried it in many mixes, but I immediately find myself wanting to accent that chocolate note a bit more.\n\n**On the Nose**  \nSmooth menthol, mellow cream with a hint of cocoa. Dark amber color.\n\n**Recommended Usage**  \n*Stand alone*: 3%\n\n*In a mix*: 0.5%-2.5%. \n\n**Throat**  \nMild\n\n**Ideal Pairings**  \nChocolate, creams, fruits, probably would work well in coffee and tobacco\n\n**Steep**  \nGood right away, but it comes together nicely after 3-5 days.\n\n**Recipe Idea: [Thin Mint](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/8207)**  \n*Ratio: 15PG/85VG*  \n*Steep: 3 days* \n\n**Ingredient**|**%**|\n:--|:--|\nFLV Creme de Menthe|1.75%|\nHS Australian Chocolate|0.5%|\n\nFLV Creme de Menthe is the star here, it is really quite good on its own, but I felt to capture the essence of a Thin Mint it needed just a touch more of that chocolate, preferrably a darker chocolate that's slightly crisp, hence the HS Australian Chocolate.  \n\n*Please if your opinion differs, or you have another review for this post it in the comments.
