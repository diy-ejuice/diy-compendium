Unripe, and it has an unpleasant off taste that I can't figure out exactly what it is.\n\nAt 4 weeks this continues to be a fresh honeydew melon, moderately strong. It's very authentic but not ripe or sweet. It has a nice full meaty mouth feel and great slightly creamy body, and the dryness is gone. However, I still get that off taste. Let me preface this by saying I have a sensitivity to BA, and I get that famous sour cheese/vomit taste from it. That is the unpleasant off taste I was getting before, and it's still there as a slight back note. Maybe it's slight rind that I am interpreting as BA? It's not overwhelming, but noticeable. I don't know if this even has BA in it, but that is the flavor I get from it. If you are one of those that does fine with BA then you should have no problems with this one. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:** Faint sour cheese/vomit.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit:** 2/10\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Pairings:** Almost any fruit, especially other melons or tropical fruits. Neutral creams like whipped, fresh, sweet. Coconut, light vanillas, maybe honeysuckle?\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Notes:** I personally don't care for this. If you don't mind unripe honeydew and BA doesn't bother you then this is very authentic. If you give it a try please let me know what you get from it.\n","author":"mysticrosell","title":"Honeydew Melon","url":"https://redd.it/62rbfr","vendor":{"name":"Purilum","code":"PUR"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"PUR","title":"Honeydew Melon"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
