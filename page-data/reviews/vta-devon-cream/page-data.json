Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Vape Train Devon Cream, 1%, 4% and 8%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 41 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Thick full cream, with a not insignificant amount of cocoa and some lemon.\n\nSo, devon cream is basically just a clotted cream with an absurdly high milkfat percentage, and this mostly delivers.  Thick, full mouthfeel.  Fairly authentic, slightly sour dairy notes.  This is pretty well steeped by this point, but the dairy notes don’t taste too butyric or funky.  Seems like a pretty authentic sweeter cream.  Moderate, warm buttery richness to the vape.  Slightly sweet, but nothing that really pulls if off a cream profile.\n\nBut there’s some chocolate to this.  Feels a bit too pleasant to call it an off flavor, but I’m not sure it’s supposed to be here.  Tastes like a pretty middle of the road cocoa flavor, but the richness and sweetness of the cream flavor is giving this a bit of milk chocolate vibe. Not an overwhelming chocolate, but it shows up pretty clearly in mixes.  I get it the most on the back half of the exhale, and seems to linger with those dairy notes.    Fairly light straight vanilla taste, but It may be getting lost in the chocolate here.  The thicker, richer dairy and those cocoa notes actually come across a lot like a chocolate milkshake, but there is an odd sort of tartness to it.\n\nBeyond the cream and the chocolate, I think I also get a bit of lemon.  Seems show up both mixed low before the cream really fills out, and then comes back again at higher percentages. Kind of reminds me of that lemon-y note in FA Custard.  It’s not unpleasant or a super aggressive pledge type lemon, but it’s noticeable at 4% and ramps up a bit from there.  \n\n**Off-Flavors:**  Fairly prominent chocolate accent. Something lemony at higher percentages.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Nah, really smooth overall.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 1%,  this is still relatively fulls but the flavor seems a bit muted. Lighter cream, decent amount of cocoa and that lemony tartness.\n\nAt 4%, this is working pretty well.  Feels thick, those cream notes are coming through pretty clearly.  Cocoa isn’t completely overbearing but it’s definitely there.  Lemon seems like the most manageable here.\n\nAt 8%,  nothing really off but doesn’t feel that much thicker or richer than 8%.  Maybe a bit more chocolate, and that lemon has come back around for me.\n\nVape train suggests mixing with this at 5-10%.  That’s probably on the high end for me.  Just based on these tests, I’d be around 5% with this as a primary flavor, but this could actually work as an accent or basic thick texturizer around 2%.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This is a really solid flavor but it may end up being a fairly specialized tool. This isn’t just a straight cream base and I don’t think you’ll be able to really mix around that chocolate kind of note and you’ll have to watch out for that lemon tartness.\n\nWithout that tartness, I’d say this is already most of the way to a chocolate milkshake.  It could use a bit of maltiness from a low percentage of FW Hazelnut or something, but it’s really close.  But then that lemon kind of smacks me in the face a little bit.\n\nYou could kind of deal with that lemony thing by adding a fresher brighter fruit like berries that won’t completely clash with a chocolate. \n\nI don’t know, maybe y’all will get less chocolate than I do.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  Not much out there through the google machine.\n\n[Here is the product page from Vape Train.  Their description: “a thick, buttery cream that’s slightly sweet and perfect for your next e-liquid recipes. This flavour can add a creamy note that’s buttery with a consistency similar to soft butter. You could find yourself adding these to bakery & dessert style recipes that require a more of a buttery yet creamy texture of that found in a devonshire clotted cream.”  But cocoa, bruh.](https://www.vapetrain.com.au/shop/vt-concentrates/devon-cream-flavour-concentrate-diy-for-e-juice-recipe/)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Devon Cream","url":"https://redd.it/88hppd","vendor":{"name":"Vape Train Australia","code":"VTA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"VTA","title":"Devon Cream"}},
