It's almost a mild generic fruity candy. Faint white grape flavor with strong artificial notes that taste quite similar to a milder version of the previous tester Gummy Candy. At a 2 week steep the generic overly sweetened fruit candy has disappeared completely. It has turned in an authentic white grape juice. It's still very sweet as grape juice tends to be, juicy and refreshing. I don't taste any skin, and this doesn't taste of fresh grapes. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:** Very artificial for first few days.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit:** 2/10\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Pairings:** Almost any fruit blend or smoothy. Cranberry, rhubarb, tart fruits will help balance the sweetness of the juice and make a good contrast.  nuts, wine, champagne, candy.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Notes:** Moderate flavor at the 6% I tested, so probably 5-7% in an RDA and around 6-8% in tanks. 1-5% as an accent.\n","author":"mysticrosell","title":"White Grapes","url":"https://redd.it/5qaomz","vendor":{"name":"Purilum","code":"PUR"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"PUR","title":"White Grapes"}},
