Ridiculously juicy even. Taste wise it's almost as good as FA's berries. I'd say maybe even better tbf because I like the sharpness here more. \n\nI'm a huge fan of devouring raw berries and then spending hours in the toilet personally. This for me feels just like that minus the fun times in the toilet. I wish it had a bit more bitterness, but I can see they were going for fully ripened berries. \n\nThe aftertaste is utterly delicious. The whole flavour itself is utterly delicious tbf. It's a good slightly playful berry mix that I can see myself enjoying this with a cup of tea or on the toilet seat without the vicious berry aftereffects. \n\n**Verdict**: Good shit without the berry shits. Authentic and without the perfumey flavour of most berry mixes on the market.\n\nComplimentary recipe:\n\n2% VTA Forest Mixed Berries\n\n1% VTA Fairy Floss","author":"RoninVX","title":"Forest Mixed Berries","url":"https://redd.it/qcvgku","vendor":{"name":"Vape Train Australia","code":"VTA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"VTA","title":"Forest Mixed Berries"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
