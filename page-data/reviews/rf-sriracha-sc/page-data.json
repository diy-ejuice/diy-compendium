Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** RF SC Sriracha @ 2%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 22 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Pretty spot on to sriracha actually. Pretty solid heat to this, At 2%, I'd say it's maybe just a bit less spicy than actual sriracha, but you've got the added bonus of having it all through your lungs and sinuses.  Garlic heavy, but handled in about the best way it could be. There's a honey sweetness and a savory almost oyster sauce kind of body that gives the garlic some body.  More roasted garlic than straight raw garlic.  No overwhelming acidic vinegar type of taste, but still enough acid brightness to really set the entire thing off.  Until it burns, it's actually a pretty rocking savory hot sauce vape.\n\nAnd if you really want an excuse not to vape a lot of this beyond the obvious, it does burn quite a bit. It's got that same sticky, viscous body as RF SC Cherry Cola Type and RF SC Brown Sugar.  It's also got a deep red-orange color to it that manages to stain anything that it comes into contact with. \n\n**Off-flavors:**  Strangely enough, none, until it burns. Starts off with a very good thicker non-vinegar based hot sauce with a whole lot of garlic, some sweetness, and a savory body.  But then you can taste whatever is making this sticky burning off the coils.  Adds to the je ne sais quoi of the concentrate, but is probably a bad thing in general.\n \n**Throat Hit:**  14/10. \n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Screwing with people. Drunken dares. Punishment, especially for vaping related sins. General idiocy.\n\n**Notes:**  I don't really want to test this for concentration, and vaping it at 2% destroys my ability to taste any nuance here. I will say, it's still noticeably spicy at .25%. If it didn't have that burning problem, I'd recommend it in small amounts to the elusive savory bloody mary vape. At 2%, you're definitely at full novelty vape status. You aren't going to fit much else in there around that overwhelming spice and savory garlic. At 4%, it's definitely spicy, and the garlic is even more prominent. At somewhere around 8-10% it didn't seem noticeably spicier than 4%, but I wouldn't really trust my ability to taste anything after trying this at 4%.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nLol, no.\n\n[Here's the product page from Real Flavors.  Their take: \"This exotic, spicy chili pepper sauce (which includes distilled vinegar, garlic, sugar and salt) originated in Thailand…and today, it’s setting mouths aflame everywhere. Are you brave enough to try our savory Sriracha? We dare you.\"](http://www.realflavors.com/shop/sriracha-super-concentrate/)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**\n\nA big hearty \"Screw You\" to /u/ID10-T/ for the suggestion.\n\nI did my intial test of this (along with RF SC Carrot, and RF SC Tomato) as part of an almost unbearably awkward youtube video located [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdgIT1PxYxw).  I go over the weird viscosity issue, and after regrettably vaping this again I'm definitely noticing some issues with burning.","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Sriracha SC","url":"https://redd.it/6i31zd","vendor":{"name":"Real Flavors","code":"RF"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"RF","title":"Sriracha SC"}},
