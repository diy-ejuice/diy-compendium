Both seems very realistic. No bakery or any similar smell present.\n\n**Testing:** More clove upfront than ginger. I can confirm that both spicies feel authentic, it gives you the right spicy note without scratching your throat out and I was surprised that it didn't feel dry at all. The big down side of this flavor is that there's no bakery notes at all, just pure ginger and clove. No off-notes present.\n\n**Pairings:** Floral profiles, tea's, bakery's and tobaccos.\n\n**Usage:** Overall I recommend this around at 0.25-0.5% since it's very concentrated. Tried at 0.75% but it started to get very dry and the clove even more upfront.\n\n**Conclusions:** There's no much to say unfortunely. It's ginger and clove. CAP Gingerbread is still my favorite and there's no comparison with this one.\n\n**More information:**http://www.inawerawinkel.com/CONCENTRATE-GINGERBREAD/1740/?i=en  \n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n**INW Miss Cream**  \nTested at: 0.5%, 1%, 2% / 2 weeks steep.\n\n**First Impressions:** One the nose I get fudge, a mild artificial vanilla mixture with heavy cream. The fudge is more prominent than the rest.\n\n**Testing:**That artificial vanilla note is messing the overall flavor. The cream is very dense to the point it makes your mouth with a 'heavy feeling', there's no dairy notes and it's way dry for my taste. Only thing I find positive is the fudge note which it's sticky and authentic. There's a dark caramel note somewhat similar to FA Caramel and a very mild dark chocolate note.\n\n**Pairings:** Custard's, bakery's and maybe tobaccos?\n\n**Usage:** Between 0.5%-1.5%. At low percentages, the vanilla is not so present which is good and allows the fudge to be more upfront. Upping the percentages, that dense cream starts to come out. I still tried to play with this with INW Custard and CAP VCv1 and the cream just messes with all.\n\n**Conclusions:** I really don't know what to do with this one. The vanilla note really messes me up.\n\n**More information:** http://www.inawerawinkel.com/CONCENTRATE-MISS-CREAM/1701/?i=en\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n**INW Rumble Crumble**  \nTested at: 2%, 3% / 2 weeks steep.\n\n**First Impressions:** On the nose, a mix of cranberry and blackcurrant, both authentic, cooked and warm. Not jammy. I get some kind of a baked cookie note too.\n\n**Testing:** Just like my first impressions, both the cranberry and the blackcurrant creates a beautiful bond. It doesn't give me a jammy or a syrup type flavour, just a slightly cooked and warm comfort fruit. The crust/cookie/crumble note is also noticeable but only in high wattages. FA Apple Pie helps a lot here to bring more that bakery note upfront. There's a light cinnamon note too but barely present.\n\n**Pairings:**Other fruits, bakery's, custards, tea's or other floral profiles.\n\n**Usage:** Between 2-3% seems the right spot. Didn't get any off notes and overall seems balanced. The downside of this flavour is if you want to make a crumble with other kind of fruits or only the crumble part, you'll get that cranberry and blackcurrant right on your face. So it's a very limited flavour.\n\n**More information:** http://www.inawerawinkel.com/CONCENTRATE-RUMBLE-CRUMBLE/1737/?i=en\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n**INW Yes We Cheesecake**  \nTested at: 2%, 3% / 2 weeks steep.\n\n**First Impressions:** On the nose, you really get what's supposed to be. This indeed represents an authentic European cheesecake. The cream cheese? Checked. The crunchy biscuit base? Checked too!\n\n**Testing:** Starting with the base. It's present and it's combined with the body of the flavour. It's cooked perfectly and it feels like it just came out of the oven. The cream cheese filling is on point! It tastes just like the Philadelphia (brand) cream cheese. You get the cheesiness of the cream cheese but it's not gross and it doesn't muddle the complexity of the flavour.\nThe cream component complements the rest.\n\n**Pairings:** Fruits and bakery's.\n\n**Usage:** Beetween 2-3.5% seems the right spot.\n\n**Conclusions:** If you enjoy cheesecake profiles, give this a try. This stands out compared to other cheesecakes like CAP NY, LA Cheesecake or TPA Cheesecake (Graham Crust), but this one I don't consider a cheesecake, more the base of one.\n\n**More information:** http://www.inawerawinkel.com/YES-WE-CHEESECAKE/1734/?i=en\n\n**Other topics in Reddit:**\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/6swmmj/inawera_yes_we_love_cheesecake_prepremiere_test/\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/86dxdx/inw_yes_we_cheesecake/\n\nPS: Sorry if I misplaced some words but English is not my primary language.","author":"Katumbas","title":"Yes, We Cheesecake","url":"https://redd.it/873koh","vendor":{"name":"Inawera","code":"INW"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"INW","title":"Yes, We Cheesecake"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
