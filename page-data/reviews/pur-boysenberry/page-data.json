{"componentChunkName":"component---src-components-review-js","path":"/reviews/pur-boysenberry","result":{"data":{"reviewsJson":{"markdown":"**Percentage Used:** 6%\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Equipment Used:**  Troll RDA with a wickless single SS .8 ohm Clapton coil at 20W.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**PG/VG:** 30/70\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Steep Time:** 2 Weeks\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Aroma:** Fresh boysenberries, sweet and tart.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Flavor Description:** This is an authentic fresh boysenberry that's not artificial tasting. This one is a brighter berry, slightly closer to the raspberry side than the blackberry.  I'm not getting the juiciness with this one, it actually seems a bit dry to me. It doesn't taste like it's sweetened or has sugar added, but seems slightly sweeter than natural. It's missing that tartness usually found in fresh boysenberries, and I think that is why it seems sweeter. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:** None\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit:** 2/10 \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Pairings:** All other berries, apple, pears, coconut, honey, apricots, peaches, nut, cardamon, cinnamon, cream cheese, creams, ice cream, custard, tobaccos, smoothies, rum, sherry.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Notes:** This is a lighter strength flavoring, and it's pleasant but average. It's not great, but not bad either. It's kind of one note, missing richness and complexity. For me I think a good strength for a single flavor is 7-9% and 2.5-4% in mixes.","author":"mysticrosell","title":"Boysenberry","url":"https://redd.it/5skqjr","vendor":{"name":"Purilum","code":"PUR"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"PUR","title":"Boysenberry"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
