It's a very good strawberry taffy flavor, but not strong enough at this percentage. The strawberry is there, and slightly more prominent than the taffy. The strawberry note is similar to Strawberry Ripe with an added bump of artificial. Not a hard candy flavor, definitely taffy. Just needs a higher percentage for SF.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:** None\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit:** 1/10\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Pairings:**  Other fruits that are good with strawberry like bananas, kiwi, rhubarb, creams, candy.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Notes:** I think 9-12% will be much better for a SF, buy will have to test to know for sure.
