Like TFA RY4 Double, but not so heavy on the Cyclotene. There’s a slight hint of nuttiness to it too, but it’s very subtle. I don’t really get a whole lot of tobacco, smoke, or ash here, but I’m not really too upset about it. It’s tasty. I think if RY4 Double is a bit too funky for you, this would be a good replacement. It seems about on par with the strength. 1.5% is definitely present, but it can be taken higher. I would probably stay away from anything too crazy though. 5% is about as high as I’d take it, with 2-3% probably being a bit more typical. \n\n**Off flavors:** Nope\n\n**Pairings:** Anywhere you’d use any RY4 flavor. There’s really too many things to even list, since I’ve seen RY4 Double mixed with just about everything. \n\n**Second Opinions:** Didn’t see anything on Reddit about it, but [three reviews on BCF are all positive](https://www.bullcityflavors.com/tab-blended-hs/) and touch on the nuttiness and RY4-esque taste. Probably wouldn’t go with their percentages. [Vaping Zone has some reviews](https://www.vapingzone.com/Tab-Blended-Concentrated-Hangsen-Flavor-/pid-804.html#customer_reviews_804) that are positive. Seems some people are getting more nutty taste than I am. Maybe that comes out more in the 10-15% range that so many people seem to be using. Couple mention this tasting like DK Tab. Never had that, so I can’t say one way or another. If you’ve had it and liked it, then that might excite you. I’m assuming it is a Hangsen e-liquid, which would make sense for this to taste the same. [ECF thread](https://www.e-cigarette-forum.com/threads/hangsen-e-liquid-dk-tab-taste-and-tab-flavor-concentrate-taste.659326/) confirms that it is a Hangsen Eliquid and that this is the same thing they use to make it. Also gives some more reasonable percentages that are a little closer to what I recommend above. \n\nThat should give you a pretty good idea. I get mostly RY4, others get more nutty, but we all agree it’s good shit. \n\n[DIY_Ejuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)","author":"ChemicalBurnVictim","title":"Tab Blended","url":"https://redd.it/7f4hnn","vendor":{"name":"Hangsen","code":"HS"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"HS","title":"Tab Blended"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
