I will say that it's a great flavor off the bat though and I'll definitely will make use of it.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Flavor Properties:**\n\n- bright aromatic blend (not overly aromatic, it's a nice subtle one that I will actually use in mixes.)\n- touch of citrus\n- slightly sweet\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Relatable Flavors:**\n\n- very gentle orange citrus note stands in the front\n- maybe a hint of whipped cream, minus the vanilla, this is waaay in the background\n- the base notes are non-sweet but also hard to describe. This this flavor uses the same base as Native Tobacco and Kentucky Blend by FLV. The three are, in fact, very similar.\n- the citrus in this also reminds me of INW Captain Jack For Pipe, but this one is less strong on the citrus note. They would def play well together.\n- there's a dry note at the end of the exhale, not quite ash but same mouthfeel\n- there's no inherent leaf flavor like INW Black For Pipe or FLV Virginia, but this flav, along with Native and Kentucky, all remind me of rolling tobacco.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Mouth Feel:**\n\n- medium/light body\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:**\n\n- none\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Position In A Recipe:**\n\n- I would use it as an accent note but it's a tasty standalone and you could position it centre stage in a mix no prob.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Suggested Percentage:**\n\n- 2-3%\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Pairings:**\n\n- FLV Virginia (or any other leafy/grassy Virginia you have on hand.)\n- INW Black for Pipe would make a great base with this as an accent.\n- FLV Classic Cigarette (if you want to dirty up the mix and chase that analog cig feel)\n- INW Captain Jack For Pipe (if you want to bring out more citrus)\n- INW Shisha Vanilla (or any light body vanilla)\n- Whipped Cream\n- Custard\n- I dare say you could toss this in a fruit mix, especially fruity shishas.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- First off, this is so damn similar to Kentucky Blend and Native Tobacco I'm not even sure if I could tell them apart unless they were side by side. I vape a lot of Native and Kentucky and am finding it harder and harder to discern which is which. The base notes on all three of these are identical. I think Kentucky is a bit spicier, Native has more ash, and Commercial Cigarette does the citrus thing. Would have to put em all side by side to really notice more than that. My favorite of the three is Native, then Kentucky, then this.\n- I'm pretty confused why this is called what it is. Like I said, I do enjoy it but find the name wildly misleading.","author":"T_Mace","title":"Commercial Cigarette","url":"https://redd.it/5uvgb7","vendor":{"name":"Flavorah","code":"FLV"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FLV","title":"Commercial Cigarette"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
