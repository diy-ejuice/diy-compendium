Like you stuck the whole damn thing in your mouth. I can even taste the sugar on the outside. It is not as fluffy as Capella but pretty thick and sweet. It is very smooth and rich at 2%.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Nothing you wouldn't get from eating a marshmallow irl!\n\n**Throat Hit:**  This flavor is very smooth as to be expected from any cream type flavor.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This can be used where you want an authentic marshmallow flavor. I would also use this as a generic sweetener as the marshmallow flavor is not overwhelming. Might be nice with whipped cream for a nice fluffy fruit and cream. \n\n**Notes:**\n This flavor comes out quite a bit with a steep. Shake and vape it is just kind of hot sweetness but the vanilla notes really show up after a few days. \n\n\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**\n\nIf you have different opinions on the flavor or any ideas on how to use it please post them in the comments.
