Tart and not overly sweet.  Pretty close to what an actual key lime tastes like.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Nothing but limes here\n\n**Throat hit:**  10/10 very sharp on the throat by itself.\n\n**Uses:**  Great as an accent (0.5-1%) to other citrus fruits and some berries or top note (2-4%) if you really like limes. \n\n**Pairings:**  Pair 2:1 or 3:1 with FA Lime Tahiti (I use cold pressed) to create a more rounded lime.  Thick creams like Bavarian, Cheesecake, or a little Marshmallow are going to help take the sharpness away from this flavor as well.  Also works well with citrus fruits, strawberries, and sometimes coconut if you do it right.\n\n**Notes:**   Not a very desirable standalone due to it's harshness.  When using this flavor in a recipe, steeping is going to be very beneficial.  Shake and vape with this flavoring is going to be pretty rough on your throat and is not recommended unless you're a bit of a masochist.  ;)\n\nEDIT: [Link to all of our flavor reviews in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)","author":"wh1skeyk1ng","title":"Key Lime","url":"https://redd.it/4tthxz","vendor":{"name":"The Flavor Apprentice","code":"TFA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"TFA","title":"Key Lime"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
