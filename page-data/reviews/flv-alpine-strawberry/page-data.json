I'd say it's not so much that it tastes floral, as much as it is that it hits you in the same spot that a floral would (if that makes sense). I feel this may be a good strawberry for folks that have trouble tasting strawberry (although I cannot confirm this since I can taste strawberry). Makes for a great top note, but does not work well with creams/custards, so you will need to most likely pair this with florals, tobaccos, earth notes, other fruits etc.\n\nSo, let's address the elephant in the room: the price point. This is easily the most expensive concentrate I've worked with. Typically with super expensive concentrates, they are super concentrated. This one is moderately concnetrated, being used in most of my recipes from 0.5%-1.5%. It doesn't pair with typical Strawberry pairings as well, but it is surely one that will not fade out on you. I love the actual flavor of this concentrate, but I can imagine that this type of strawberry flavor is not for everyone.  \n\nIt's hard for me to recommend this one way or the other. For me, I'm not too concerned with price as long as I enjoy the flavoring, so for someone like me it's a great addition to your flavor arsenal; for others it will be very hard to justify spending what is basically an entire orders budget on one flavoring. \n\n**On the Nose**  \nSharp crisp strawberry note; strong chemical smell.  \n\n##DO NOT FINGER TASTE OR WATER-TASTE THIS FLAVOR!!  \n\n**Recommended Usage**  \n*Stand alone*: 1%-2%\n\n*In a mix*: 0.5%-1.5% \n\n**Throat**  \nMild to Moderate.

I think this is the greatest feature of this flavor is how far it can push a strawberry flavor to the front.
