The lemon to meringue ratio is good, without any egg taste. The lemon is very smooth, creamy and vibrant, however it doesn't have that tart twang that is inherent to a good lemon meringue pie. It reminds me of Jello brand lemon meringue pudding, like it has some type of cream. Which is very good and refreshing. I like it at 15% as a SF if you are looking for an easy instant pudding, and it has little to no harshness to the throat, which is unusual for lemon. I think with some TFA Graham Cracker Clear or Pie Crust and .25-.5% FA Cold Pressed Lime to give it that zippy tartness, this will make a very good pie. Or LA Tart & Sour, or whatever you use for sour.","author":"mysticrosell","title":"Lemon Meringue VG Version","url":"https://redd.it/55sdbf","vendor":{"name":"Real Flavors","code":"RF"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"RF","title":"Lemon Meringue VG Version"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
