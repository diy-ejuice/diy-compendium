    "result": {"data":{"reviewsJson":{"markdown":"**Setup:** Recoil w/ flavor barrel, Dual 15 wrap 26g 3mm Nifethal 70 coils @.17 ohms.  60w power, 450F temp limit. Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Caramel @ 3%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 29 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Heavy on the sugar, light on any sort of cream. Moderate pleasant sweetness. Mouthfeel is a little buttery but no real rich, buttery taste to it.  More of a brown sugar simple syrup than full caramel.\n\nInhale is dense brown sugar sweetness. Natural tasting sweetness without any chemical off-flavors. Exhale is relatively thin, with some cooked sugar top notes but mostly a middle-heavy raw brown sugar taste.  Really subtle richness here with a richer mouthfeel than actual taste.  Overall tastes quite a bit thinner than you'd expect from a relatively strong flavor.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Slightly soapy aftertaste solo. A little bit like grabbing a glass the dishwasher didn't quite finish with.  I've never noticed it coming across in a mix.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Light. Raw sugar taste is a bit harsh.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I'd use this a lot like TFA Brown Sugar Extra, a richer dark sweetener.  Good fit for bakery applications, as that brown sugar sweetness does taste a little cooked and fairly natural.\n\n/u/joesepaa/ mentions a RY4 in the second opinions a bit later, and that does seem like a natural fit. This would be great as a sweetener for tobacco mixes without adding any weird candy or sucralose notes.\n\nTastes a bit raw for lighter creams, but it could bump up some brulee notes or sweetness with a custard mix.\n\nLacks the body or richness I'd want from a solo caramel.  I don't see getting to a full caramel without a different caramel concentrate in the mix. Even with the diketones here, doesn't seem to be much richer than FA Caramel. \n\n**Notes:**\n\nS&V Concentration testing, what little richness I get here comes in low.  As low as 1% and I get about all the buttery notes that seem to be available here.  That raw brown sugar and  sweetness scale up from there.  I'd mix with this at 1% if I was just shooting for whatever caramel this brings to the table. I'd bump up to 2 to 3% if you're mostly after the sweetness here.  This definitely isn't a solo concentrate for me, just because I find that raw sugar note off-putting by itself.\n\nOverall, seems like a good sweetener, but not a great caramel.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nIt's probably worth noting that I've heard rich used quite a bit to describe this.  A couple reviews on [flavorah's site](http://store.flavorah.com/concentrated-caramel-flavor) and [one review on ECX](http://www.ecigexpress.com/diy-e-liquid/browse-flavorings/dessert-flavors/caramel-by-flavorah.html) talk about this richness.  I just don't get it here.\n\n[/u/joesephaa/ provides a quick rundown and suggests pairing with coffee and tobacco.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/3hynae/what_are_your_opinions_of_flv_caramel_and_flv/)\n\n[Pretty solid notes on ELR.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/43051)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Caramel","url":"https://redd.it/5l2mxw","vendor":{"name":"Flavorah","code":"FLV"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FLV","title":"Caramel"}},
