The vanilla notes are pretty rich and comparable to the vanilla classic by FA. Very faint wood-notes at the last part of the exahle. The lingering taste is best descriped as vanilla pudding.\n\nOff-flavors: None that i would be aware of.\n\nThroat hit: None, maybe a bit dry  \n  \nToughts:  \nMixed at 3% most of the caramel notes vanish and it becomes a creamy vanilla flavour, at 7% it is more like a bavarian cream TFA with heavy vanilla notes. I prefer it mixed at 3% as a standalone.\nIt would play very nicely with Cap Vanilla Custard.","author":"ihatetoridethebus","title":"French Vanilla","url":"https://redd.it/5ytrrt","vendor":{"name":"Capella","code":"CAP"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"CAP","title":"French Vanilla"}},
