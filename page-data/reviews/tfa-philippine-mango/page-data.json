It is slightly pungent, but not in a bad way.  It has a bit of a syrupy sensation on the tongue after a few draws.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Nothing noted.\n\n**Throat hit:** 3/10 mild, yet noticable\n\n**Uses:** I have seen this used at much higher percentages (8-12%) to get a desired flavor.  I personally am very happy with less than that, but start low and work up to where you like it.  Great ingredient in your tropical mixes or berry/cream blends as desired.  There are also many other uses and recipes discussed much more in-depth in FOTW posts [here](https://redd.it/54q29w) and [here](https://redd.it/37xd26).\n\n**Pairings:**  Other mangoes, preferred fruits, most creams, and that little pungent note might blend well with some booze flavors.\n\n**Notes:** Relatively versatile in the sense that this flavor has uses and isn't weird at almost any percentage, plus it mixes well with most ingredients you already have.\n\nFlavor available at BCF [here](http://www.bullcityflavors.com/philippine-mango-tfa/) with reports of weak taste but notable satisfaction as well.\n\n[Link to e-liquid-recipes notes on this flavor](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/23230)\n\n[Link to all of our flavor reviews in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)","author":"wh1skeyk1ng","title":"Philippine Mango","url":"https://redd.it/5rcupz","vendor":{"name":"The Flavor Apprentice","code":"TFA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"TFA","title":"Philippine Mango"}},
