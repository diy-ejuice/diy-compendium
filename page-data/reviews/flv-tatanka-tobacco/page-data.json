Right off the bat i'm in love with this flavor, i'm going to mix some up for adving. It definitely reminds me of my mom's toffee with milk chocolate and walnuts on top, but it's not exactly chocolatey, that's just the idea that comes into my head when i vape it. Not so much a \"real\" tobacco, but it's delicious and i definitely recommend it.\n\nOff flavors: none\n\nThroat Hit: none to me\n\nUses and pairings: I think this would go very well with a dry, leafy tobacco like Dark for pipe. This might go with something like Red for pipe, but that would be a stretch. definitely caramels and/or butterscotches. Maybe a cream like Catalan Cream or Creme Brulee.\n\nSecond Opinions: none that i could find on here.","author":"[deleted]","title":"Tatanka Tobacco","url":"https://redd.it/6mie15","vendor":{"name":"Flavorah","code":"FLV"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FLV","title":"Tatanka Tobacco"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
