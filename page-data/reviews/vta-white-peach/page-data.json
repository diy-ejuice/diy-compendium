British peaches are funny tho, they don't behave like peaches nor have any similar taste. Just a side/funny note, don't kill me brits pls I still gotta live in this country.\n\nRight onto the flavour. It's really nice and really hits the tongue well and the roof of the mouth. It just feels very focused on both parts no matter how I vaped em. I recently stopped DTL (well I only DTL like 1-2 times per week) so I can't speak about that, but MTL that's what I felt. Pretty interesting mouthfeel overall. Very smooth to inhale. \n\nExhale was quite pleasant as well.\n\nThe flavour is really confusing me tho. I've heard of flavourings which change based on temperature, but always figured it's just a weird niche. Well here we have one definitely so I guess I'll write my settings and what I experienced?\n\n1 of 4 holes open, 15w: Nice pleasant aroma of peaches, smells delicious (the bottle itself just smells absolutely fantastic). Makes me feel like it's the perfect accent like this. I really enjoy exhaling this through my nose for this reason, it just feels and smells delicious, even if the body is missing and the taste is mostly on the exhale. Enjoyable, mid notes are fantastic. \n\n1 of 4 holes, 16w: Short tokes - nada, long tokes - nada, just a slight tickle on my tongue maybe. Exhale has no taste, inhale has no taste, what the fuck is going on. \n\n2 of 4 holes, 16.5w: Suddenly it has taste again and DAMN it's good! It's actually REALLY really good! Currently I vary between this setting and the first one I mentioned because I really enjoy the sensation of both of them! Really REALLY delicious, juicy feeling with a sharp bright peach note, really hits the spot. If this was the permanent flavour I'd be recommending this flavour A LOT! \n\n2 of 4 holes open, 18w: Nope, flavour's gone again, just a tiny bit of exhale. Feels like I'm vaping well textured VG/PG I guess? Really weird behavior.\n\nAll holes, 15w: very faint peach, quite lackluster, I don't dig it\n\nAll holes, 16w: Nothing, no flavour. Wtf. Have to toke a bunch of times to get some flavour going.\n\nAll holes, 17w: Loses a lot of the really enjoyable mouthfeel, but obtains the faint taste of generic underripe peach. Odd shit\n\nAll holes, 18w: Delicious albeit slightly underripe peach. Slightly \"green\" feel to it. \n\nThese are the settings I personally tried and I kid you not it DOES change a LOT between each of these. I really am baffled that this is happens with flavours, but then again chemistry is unpredictable (well no, it's predictable most often I guess). Now since I'm using Kanthal coils there's no point in trying to go for temperature control settings, but if anyone ever feels like giving it a shot do mention in the comment and I'll include it in the review. \n\nDo I recommend it? If you like nice legit peach sure, but use it as a single flavour, because I feel this flavour is very unpredictable. Unless you want to experiment even further and try different combos/use it in an ADV that changes itself a lot based on temperature (I can go into further detail, but without TC I can't really say much about the accuracy of end results). If you feel experimental and have time on your hands go right ahead! \n\nWhat would I pair it with? Pft, beats me, maybe something fleshy and tart to match its nice sweet sour aromatic feel. Strawberries maybe, I really don't know. Not huge on peaches IRL so beats me what people mix them with...\n\nWhat WOULDN'T I pair it with? I'd defo not keep it anywhere close to cookies/bakeries/pastries et cetera. \n\nThis also doesn't seem to change at all with steeping like NOTHING changed at all. Maybe I just was confused or something by it. Maybe it'll change in a recipe with something completely different? \n\nI know these are a bunch of maybes rather than informative statements, but this flavour is quite complex and definitely just an enigma for me. Very enjoyable, nonetheless.","author":"RoninVX","title":"White Peach","url":"https://redd.it/hp0o0t","vendor":{"name":"Vape Train Australia","code":"VTA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"VTA","title":"White Peach"}},
