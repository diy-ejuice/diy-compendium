I get some itching and scratching and a tad pressure on the chest too.\n\n**Uses and pairings**: Fruits, fruits and lots of fruits and tobacco! That is exactly what I can see this being used for. Don't bother adding this to bakeries or deserts really. Possibly creams, but not as a main note at least. For an accent, you kinda wanna push this to around 2% and this is where the juiciness start's to appear. I have pushed it all the way to 5%, which I find to be just fine as a stand-alone. Although I can't really see this being used as a main note nor as a stand-alone. It's a little too floral to be used as a main note, which the juciness and deep black cherry notes can't overcome. With that said, it is one of the better cherries that I have tried, as it does have a more natural cherry flavor and not much candy going on.\n\n**Off-flavors**: Sadly, like many other cherries, this one has issues. In the range of 2-3% I pick up a heavy note of perfume, which are common in many cherry flavors. It does have a nice juciness and a deep note of black ripe cherry, but that perfume kinda destroy the joy. At the exhale, I sadly get hit by a wave of the perfume, which puts a bad end to your vaping circle (sorry, lack of better explanation).\n\n**Notes**: Let's adress the elephant in the room here. Besides the perfume, this flavor has one HUGE issue. It's not based in the taste itself, but this is an issue that will make the more experienced mixers stay away from using this. This flavor has red food dye in it. It's common in this community amongst the experienced mixers, that food dye has no place in mixing, as you do not want to add something that is just not supposed to be there. It's all about control, and once something like food dye is forced upon you, then you're at the point where as an experienced mixer you probably won't use it. If you don't care, then it's fine and dandy (besides the rush of perfume).\n\nFinally, which I forgort to mention in my previous reviews; their concentrates come in a minimum at 30ml, which again is not ideal. If they offered at least 10ml, so we as mixers has a chance to test their flavors, then I think they'd have a much better chance at competing with the other brands out there.\n\n[**DIY\\_eJuice Flavor Reviews**](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)","author":"Kittybit8","title":"Black Cherry","url":"https://redd.it/esad7t","vendor":{"name":"DuraSmoke","code":"DS"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"DS","title":"Black Cherry"}},
