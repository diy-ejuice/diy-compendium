The graphics show menthol crystals on a plate, but it is actually menthol crystals dissolved in PG and alcohol.  The Flavor West page shows the same graphic, but lists it as \"Menthol (Liquid)\" with the description \"Natural Menthol (Liquid) Flavoring\".\n\nFW states \"Usage Rate 15-20% for E-use\".  ELR shows 1 to 2.5% for Percentages in recipes and  8.1 to 10% for single flavor mixes.  Reddit posts were all over the map.  Where to start?  I went with 2%.\n\nAbout a year ago, I got 2 bottles of Banzai Subzero at 18mg/ml nic.  I tried it and liked the cool sensation, but the nic was way too high for me.  I'm currently vaping 3% nic.  Subzero's menthol flavor is harsh and not particularly tasty, but that cool sensation is fun.\n\nA 2% single flavor mix vapes really nice in a dripper.  I get the cool sensation, and the flavor is equal part menthol and part light peppermint.  Much tastier than Subzero.\n\nI plan on increasing the concentration and testing in a tank, and testing in a MTL setup, too.\n\n* 24 hours later: tried the 2% mix in the Goblin Mini V1 tank.  The Goblin Mini is a pretty good flavor tank, but most of the cool sensation is not there.  Tested again in a dripper and the cool is still there, no change,  just as good as yesterday.  Tomorrow, I'll make a 4% mix.\n* 24 more hours later: the 4% mix is noticeable and pleasant in the Goblin Mini.  It is at least twice as strong in the dripper.  Not tomorrow, but soon I'll try 6%, gotta find the upper limit.","author":"VAPORMARK","title":"Menthol","url":"https://redd.it/4gggcu","vendor":{"name":"Flavor West","code":"FW"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FW","title":"Menthol"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
