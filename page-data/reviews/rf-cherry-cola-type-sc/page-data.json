Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** RF SC Cherry Cola Type @ 2% and 4%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 10 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Just right off the bat, I'm not entirely sure I should be vaping this. This is dark and really syrupy. And it stains. I'm pretty sure you could use this for prison tattoos. I'm not particularly squeamish about this kind of stuff, but even at 2% this makes for a spooky dark mix. 4% is almost black. I've vaped darker concentrates before (cough, FA Cocoa, TPA Kahlua and Cream, cough) but none of them had this weird kind of sticky, inky vibe to them.  I'm probably going to die.\n\nPersonally, this just tastes burnt to me. I can't find a percentage or temperature where this isn't just turning my coils wicks black and crusty. On the first drip on clean cotton, I get some black cherry kind of slightly medicinal flavor, and a kind of thin cola base in the background.  Definitely has that acid bite of real cola, but it doesn't do the burned notes any favors. Even just on the tail end of the first drag it tastes flat, bitter, and burned.  The flavor here isn't strong or clear enough to come through at the kind of low dilution you'd need to avoid that burning.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Everything after the first half of the first inhale. It's all gunk.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Harsh. It gets really weird, really fast.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Mix it soda water? I can't really get behind vaping this, it just physically doesn't vape without starting to burn.\n\n**Notes:**  I try to be a bit more helpful with reviews, but I haven't found a percentage where this doesn't taste burnt. There's a really light flavor at .25%, but after a couple drags, it's still just burned coil gunk.\n\nAt 2%, I can literally paint with this juice.\n\n[Seriously.](http://i.imgur.com/3LBjJhj.jpg)\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Here's the product page from Real Flavors.
