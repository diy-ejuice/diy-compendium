At 1% it is not overpowering, but rather mild. I'm not getting any floral or shoe-like off-flavors like I did from FLV Strawberry, but it is interesting to note that in a few of the second opinions these two were lumped together at least once for tasting off. The sweetness here is not too powerful (its actually the perfect level of sweetness IMO). Like daath says in the second opinions, this sticks in your mouth a bit (which I think is a plus for this one). \n\n**Off-flavors:** none that I got, but in the second opinions there are reports of medicinal off-flavors (possibly from using at a high %)\n\n**Throat Hit:** Not really.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:** This would be a great place to start for strawberry jam, or strawberry filled donuts. This will benefit from supporting strawberries in most cases. I would start at 0.5% in a mix just because this is by FLV. Average % of use on ATF is 1.25%; although, I could see this being used up to 1.5-2% if you aren't going to support it with other strawberries in a mix. This is already sweet so mix accordingly with profiles that need a sweet jammy strawberry.\n\n**Notes:** Thanks to /u/ConcreteRiver for sending me this flavor for the purpose of reviewing it with my God-like ability to taste strawberry flavors.\n\n**Second Opinions:** [From the FLV website:](http://store.flavorah.com/concentrated-strawberry-filling-flavor) JoeVapor says \"i ordered this and anxiously waited for it to arrive. The day it got here (along with 5 other flavors), I could almost taste it as I was mixing it as a standalone flavor at first to test it out. I must say, this has a very distinct flavor that is hard to get rid of. Yes, I instantly regretted this purchase on the first draw. It tastes exactly like that horrible children's liquid medicine. ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE!!! I am a big fan of other Flavorah flavors, but this is one that I will very adamantly speak out against. And to add insult to injury, I was not able to get the taste out of my mouth for probably half an hour!!!\"\n\n[From some notes on ATF for SCB:](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/44626#scb_strawberry_chocolate_beignets_by_steamroom) steamroom says \"After a good steep this ingredient transforms into a light, creamy, syrupy strawberry note. Not cloying or overly bright.\"\n\n[Some tidbits fromELR:](http://forum.e-liquid-recipes.com/t/strawberry-flavorah/126544) Laura5 says \"artificial, good for highlighting the reg strawberry, not for stand alone ... I use a couple drops with my strawberry recipes to brighten it up.\"\n\ndaath says \"I don't like Strawberry Filling much - it seems to stick in your mouth :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:\"\n\n\n\n\n","author":"PerennialPhilosopher","title":"Strawberry Filling","url":"https://redd.it/6crwtg","vendor":{"name":"Flavorah","code":"FLV"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FLV","title":"Strawberry Filling"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
