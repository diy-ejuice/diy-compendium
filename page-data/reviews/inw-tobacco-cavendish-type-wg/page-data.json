It has a honey note but does not scream flavored tobacco to me so I'm gonna put it as non-aromatic with a caveat.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Flavor Properties:**\n\n- light\n- smooth\n- mild\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Relatable Flavors:**\n\n- honey note (not inherently sweet though)\n- light florals (lavender?)\n- some people report plum on the exhale but I'm not getting that at all\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Mouth Feel:**\n\n- light body\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:**\n\n- none\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Position In A Recipe:**\n\n- use to soften harsher tobaccos\n- that honey note could be nice in a dark burley blend or virginia\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Suggested Percentage:**\n\n- 1-2%\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Pairings:**\n\n- FLV Red Burley\n- a leafy Virginia\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- Oddly, when I first smelled this in the bottle, I thought I wouldn't like it. It has a black licorice note on the nose and I usually don't like tobaccos with that in them. But I can't taste the licorice note so was pleasantly surprised.\n- Important: More on smell, I have to point out, the vapor has a bit of a cat piss smell. I don't notice if I'm vaping it, but if I take a few puffs and sniff the air, that's when I notice it. I'll have to try it in a mix to see if it gets covered up.\n- Overall, it's not a bang on \"oh my god tobacco!\" type deal but I can make use of this in a non-aromatic mix.","author":"T_Mace","title":"Tobacco Cavendish Type WG","url":"https://redd.it/5w5rg4","vendor":{"name":"Inawera","code":"INW"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"INW","title":"Tobacco Cavendish Type WG"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
