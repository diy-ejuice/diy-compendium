    "result": {"data":{"reviewsJson":{"markdown":"**Setup:** Plume Veil RDA; dual parallel @ .35Î©; cotton wicks; 45W\n\n**Testing:** TFA Apple Pie @ 3%; Aged: 3 days\n\n**Flavor description:**  Cinnamon/nutmeg pie crust with decently tart yet sweet apple notes.  A bit sugary.  Tastes like more of a green apple due to it's tartness, but there seems to be a bit of red apple sweetness to it as well.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  The cinnamon/nutmeg flavor might be harsh for sensitive throats.\n\n**Throat hit:** 7/10 \n\n**Uses:**  Bakery recipes, or to add a light cinnamon/nutmeg spice note to your mix.  If it already has fruit in it, it will blend well without the apple taking over at lower percentages. \n\n**Pairings:** Creams, custards, caramel, cookies, possibly some nuts or tobacco.  Another apple flavor such as FA Fuji or INW Two Apples if you're after a stronger apple taste.\n\n**Notes:**   To me, this is definitely a crust-forward flavoring, but the apple taste sits noticeably in the background.\n\nEDIT: [Link to all of our flavor reviews in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)","author":"wh1skeyk1ng","title":"Apple Pie","url":"https://redd.it/4qcd5q","vendor":{"name":"The Flavor Apprentice","code":"TFA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"TFA","title":"Apple Pie"}},
