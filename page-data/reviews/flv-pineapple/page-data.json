    "result": {"data":{"reviewsJson":{"markdown":"**Setup:** Velocity 2 Clone, Dual 15 wrap 3mm Nifethal 70 coils @.18 ohms.  45W power, 480F temp limit. Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Pineapple @ 3%, 70/30 VG/PG, Steeped 2 weeks.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Halfway between a realistic pineapple and a candy pineapple.  It's decently tart, and has some of the bright pineapple top notes, but it also has a rich body and a solid sweetness.  A solid, pineapple juice type flavor.\n\n**Off-flavors:** None.\n\n**Throat Hit:** 5/10, slight throat hit but it's pineapple, so I'd expect that.\n\n**Uses:**  It's pineapple, bruh. I think this versatile enough to be used in fruit mixes and in creamier mixes.  The only place where this flavor would need some help would be a baked pineapple taste.  It's a little too juicy and bright for pineapple bakeries, and I'd still lean on CAP Golden Pineapple for those.\n\n**Pairings:**  Damn near any fruit or cream.  Mints, maybe even tobacco blends.  I'd probably stay away from heavy chocolate or really \"cooked\" bakeries.\n\n**Notes:**  I think this is my new favorite single pineapple concentrate.  TFA is super sharp and acidic,  CAP Golden Pineapple is too dull and canned.  FA Pineapple is apparently some kind of biblical abomination. INW Pineapple is good, and is just a touch brighter than FLV Pineapple but has some light perfumey notes I don't find in FLV.  It's also strangely weak for INW and so if you are using 5-6% of the INW, FLV @ 2-3% becomes competitive on cost. \n\n[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Pineapple","url":"https://redd.it/5bapjs","vendor":{"name":"Flavorah","code":"FLV"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FLV","title":"Pineapple"}},
