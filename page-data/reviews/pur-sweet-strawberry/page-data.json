It doesn't taste artificial or candy like. The strawberry is in the front of the inhale, with a strong sugar and faint strawberry exhale. It reminds me of fresh cut strawberries sweetened with sugar that you would use in strawberry shortcake. It's delicious, but I still think I would mix this with another strawberry for more depth as I haven't tasted one yet that doesn't improve with layering. I'm also going to try this at a higher and a lower percentage to see what happens, I'm a curious sort.  But with how dominant the sugar is at just 7%, I'm afraid it's going to make that aspect worse. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:** None\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit:** 1/10\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Pairings:** Most any fruit, especially other berries, kiwi, banana, melons. Cookies, cakes, cereal, creams, custards, nuts, shortcakes, biscuits, pastries, cobblers, donuts, gummy or jelly candy.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Notes:** I'm thinking SF 8-12% and blends 4-7%. PUR is similar to CAP Sweet Strawberry as the sugar is stronger and more dominant while the strawberry is more of a back note. However CAP is more artificial candy like flavor vs PUR which is more overly sweetened fresh strawberry. I would have to find a less sweet fresh strawberry flavor to mix with it to balance it in a recipe, I wouldn't like it as the only strawberry component.","author":"mysticrosell","title":"Sweet Strawberry","url":"https://redd.it/5n37en","vendor":{"name":"Purilum","code":"PUR"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"PUR","title":"Sweet Strawberry"}},
