Vanilla pound cake flavor, slightly dense, topped with a dark caramel. It has a background of citrus fruit to me. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n- I get a citrus pound cake flavor, fairly sweet, reminds me strongly of an unglazed lemon-lime bundt cake, drizzled with a dark caramel. The caramel is not creamy like the candy or a sundae topping. Similar to a caramel that has been cooked until just before it scorches, where most of the sugar has cooked out and it's no longer sickeningly sweet. I don't want to say bitter, and it's not burnt, but it's a dark caramel to me. I am also getting an almost alcohol flavor, like when someones adds too much vanilla extract to something. The description says \"Sponge cake, vanilla, caramel and a host of fruity notes ... a real labyrinth of flavours to explore forever!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- I plan on breathing this for a few hours to evaporate that hint of alcohol. This is good, but I don't think it's something I would vape stand alone. Unless this changes with a longer steep, for my personal tastes it needs some creams or custards to round it out, and I would always reach for an actual lemon cake over this.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Recommended Usage**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSingle flavor: I would probably aim for 4-6% in a tank, or 3-4% in an rda.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn a mix .75-3% depending on the recipe.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMild to Moderate\n\n**Steep**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n1 week, although I'm hoping this will smooth out a bit with more time.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**UPDATE:** At 3 week steep this is not something I will be vaping at all. The citrus notes have become very forward, and it has developed that acrid note I got from Pandoro. I can't get past the dry citrus and find any caramel left for me, still slight hints of Nonna's Cake in the background. Tastes like a mix of Pandoro, Nonna's Cake, and Custard. Not pleasant at all for me. I hope everyone else has luck with this one. I am sensitive to some flavors though, like CAP Cake Batter and FA Joy...horrid to me. So don't let my experience turn you off please.","author":"mysticrosell","title":"Labyrinth","url":"https://redd.it/4w32s8","vendor":{"name":"Flavour Art","code":"FA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FA","title":"Labyrinth"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
