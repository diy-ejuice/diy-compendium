At .2% it is quite nice. I am getting a slightly sweet slice of white bread. Similar to FA Joy but not as greasy or beer like.  \n\n**Off-flavors:**  A little bit of that beer taste you get from flavors like Joy.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Very smooth on the throat, no stingy sensation at all.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I would primarily use this flavor in the same manner as FA Joy or perhaps if I wanted to make a Naan or other sweet flatbread type vape or maybe a danish. I can see this being good with cinnamon in a churro type mix as well.\n\n**Notes:**\nDo not, I repeat Do NOT use this flavor above .3%. At .2% it is nice and pleasant, slightly sweet but I didn't know this when I first got the flavor and did a sft at 1% and it almost went in the trash right then and there. It wasn't until I started reading notes from Jennifer Jarvis and diyeliquidmixology.com about other flavorah  flavors that I realized I may be using it way too high. I recommend making a 10% dilution of this flavor and mixing with that. \n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nThere aren't really any notes on this flavor, I just see that everyone is using it above 1%. There are probably no notes on it because everyone finds this flavor disgusting who is using it that high.\n\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**\n\nIf you have different opinions on the flavor or any ideas on how to use it please post them in the comments.
