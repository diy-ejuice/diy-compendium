Also dark fruits and strawberries.\n\nEdit: worth mentioning that you should probably start low (.25%) in a mix to see how it reacts with your recipe. This stuff is super concentrated!\n\nNotes: i will update in a few days to let you know how the steeping goes. i have a good feeling about this one!\n\n\n[Flavorah description reads: Front end milk chocolate with a more dry cocoa finish. Mixes well with our Chocolate Deutche, mocha and coffee. This chocolate is a game changer for anyone who has been struggling with a chocolate note in their recipes.](http://store.flavorah.com/concentrated-milk-chocolate-flavor)","author":"PerennialPhilosopher","title":"Milk Chocolate","url":"https://redd.it/5wf1wc","vendor":{"name":"Flavorah","code":"FLV"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FLV","title":"Milk Chocolate"}},
