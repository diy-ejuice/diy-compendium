This is absolutely my favorite single strawberry vape. This is a fresh, ripe, sweet strawberry. All the boxes are ticked. Tastes like a [strasberry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strasberry), which if you’ve never had one please go find one. What you’d imagine a wild strawberry on the top of a mountain to taste like. Just buy it.\n\n\n**Off-flavors**: nothing at this %\n\n\n**Throat Hit**: nothing at all\n\n\n**Uses & Pairings**: some pairings ripped some from the Flavor Bible: almonds, apricots, bananas, berries, biscuit, blackberries, blueberries, boysenberry, brandy, buttermilk, caramel, cardamom, champagne, chocolate, cinnamon, cloves, coriander, cream cheese, fresh cream, custard, elderflower syrup, ginger, grapefruit, grapes, guava, hazelnuts, honey, lemon, lime, mangoes, maple, nutmeg, melon, passionfruit, papaya, orange, peaches, mint, pies, pecans, pineapples, pistachios, plums, pomegranates, raspberries, rhubarb, rum, sugar, vanilla, walnuts, yogurt\n\n**Notes**: \n\nI like this right around 1.5-2.5%, not a noteworthy change for me from 1-14 days\n\nI’ve had trouble mixing this with heavier creams they kind of flatten it out, I’d avoid that but maybe you can use Shisha strawberry or JF sweet strawberry to help this out against some heavier stuff like I see in [these](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/47718#not_your_nonna_s_strawberry_custard_by_shakenvape007) [recipes](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/44489#basil_fawlty_s_basil_infused_strawberry_ice_cream_by_sejouced). \n\nI haven’t tried in many bakery applications but I don’t doubt it would be great there too.\n\nI’ve paired this with strawberry ripe very successfully but not with FA strawberry, it’s just too dry. It really doesn’t need much help but ripe strawberry keeps it juicy without taking anything away.  (2% of each is wonderful)\n\nWorks well with fruit mixes. Here's [one](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/47720#strawkiwi_malone_by_smoky) or [two](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/46896#lawless_by_sixstrings952)\n\n\nI’ve really enjoyed this solo, I even mixed up a 30ml of this solo at 2% and vaped through it all. \n\n**Strawberry non-tasters report being able to taste this one.**\n\n[This is a very good and pretty simple mix focused around this ingredient by a strawberry non-taster](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/38333#vibe_s_milk_by_mediocrevibes)\n\n\n**Second Opinions**:\n\nPlenty of notes on [ELR](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/111143?exclsingle=0&filter=0&sort=score&direction=desc#recipes) mainly praise as a realistic and delicious flavor.\nGreat reviews on ECX even one by me, [Vince](http://www.ecigexpress.com/shop/diy-e-liquid/browse-flavorings/fruit-flavors/strawberry-sc-by-real-flavors.html)\n\nRF site link and blurb: [Arguably the most beautiful of all berries, strawberry is a standout classic with countless uses (you know what they are). Natural, rich, ripe and sweet…our Strawberry flavor presents the juicy, familiar taste you’d expect from hand-picked strawberries on the farm. Enjoy.](http://www.realflavors.com/shop/strawberry-super-concentrate/) great reviews on RF site as well. \n\n\nEnjoy indeed my friends!\n","author":"HashSlingingSlashur","title":"Strawberry SC","url":"https://redd.it/6ebj1j","vendor":{"name":"Real Flavors","code":"RF"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"RF","title":"Strawberry SC"}},
