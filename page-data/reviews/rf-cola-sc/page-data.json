It's nice and sweet. And I absolutely hate it! Which is good for you, as I hate Coke. I have been a Diet Pepsi person my entire life. I can't even drink regular soda as to me it tastes like pure sugar. This tastes exactly like regular Coke. Not Pepsi, and we all know there is a difference. It is not effervescent, as that means fizzy and bubbly. And obviously it can't be that as it contains no carbonation. However, it doesn't have that overly sweet flat taste either. So it tastes like the real thing, just without the tingles. My husband loves it. He likes Coke. He wants me to make him a bottle of rum and coke, and vanilla coke, and cherry coke, and maybe lime coke. And he says maybe cherry vanilla coke. Which I will happily do as long as I don't have to vape it. I will not be updating this at a 4 week steep, blech. I will leave that to the other testers that actually like coke and let them talk about how a longer steep changes the strength/flavor.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Warning:**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis flavor separates extremely fast. Shake well and shake often and right before measuring. Even when trying to pull 1 ml up in a syringe to weigh it for gravity, I had to cap and shake again between every syringe full. Even though there was less than a minute in between drawing each syringe. It would weigh at 1.04g, then .79g. Then I'd shake and it would go back up to 1.05. Many times. When trying to weigh for gravity, I usually draw three 1ml syringes and use the number that comes up most, usually 2 of 3 times. This one I had to weight like 8 times and shake between each one before I got the same number a few times, so please go by your own SG on this one. And shake immediately before using. Also when putting it into the pg and vg in the flask, the flavoring stayed suspended in little black bubbles by themselves, they didn't dissolve. I was worried that it would keep separating after mixing. No worries, it blended fine with the frother, and seemed to stay blended after mixing. And it's very black. Like blended with the black rubber in the syringes so made it hard to see black. However, it didn't stain the syringes like I thought it would, but with longer exposure it might. I'm also not sure if that will affect how quickly your coils gunk either.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nEDIT: Real Flavors has announced they will be changing the names of their Raw Extracts to Super Concentrates.","author":"mysticrosell","title":"Cola SC","url":"https://redd.it/55sjh4","vendor":{"name":"Real Flavors","code":"RF"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"RF","title":"Cola SC"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
