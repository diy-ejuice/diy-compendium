I'm getting the cream, but not ice cream. Needs a longer steep. The vanilla bean hasn't developed and it's a sweet vanilla whole milk or ice cream base. No creaminess present nor noticeable mouth feel. Needs time.\n\n10 Days:  The sweetness level is about the same. The vanilla bean flavor itself has developed and lost a little of that overly bright flavor. It has moved beyond the vanilla milk into a definite ice cream base. The flavor is VBIC without a doubt, but there is still very little creaminess and no body to speak of. Flavor is comparable to other brands, but texture is lacking and therefore not comparable for me. I could probably add other creams to it to develop the mouth feel more, but honestly I wouldn't go to the trouble when I already have others brands that are already balanced.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:** None\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit:** 1/10\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Pairings:** Almost any fruit. Cookies, cakes, cereal, creams, custards, nuts, tobaccos. Anywhere you are looking for vanilla with a very light cream.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Notes:** Although the flavor on this compares well with other brands, it is lacking the richness, depth, and density. It would not be my first choice.
