Another Super dense flavor 8 out of 10.\n\n**Throat Hit**\n\n4/10\n\n**Flavor Properties** \n\nThe flavoring can be broken into two parts pineapple and Peach.\n\n*Pineapple - this flavor comes out sweet and juicy with just a touch of citrus. Pineapple is very realistic fresh crisp pineapple not that canned garbage you get on a pizza. It has a juicy slightly syrupy aspect to it adding to the density of the flavoring.\n\n*Peach - slightly candied Peach flavoring similar to Peach gummies rings. But I also get that slightly fuzzy fantastic Peach skin. I'd say the peach in this is halfway between a candy and a very authentic flavoring.\n\n\n**Position In The Recipe**\n\nFlavoring is super dense and because of that I believe will work best as a base note. \n\n**Off Flavors**\n\nThe fuzzy flavoring about Peach skin comes off very dry and although this flavoring is wet and juicy, it still somehow still dry on the inhale.\n\n**Pairings**\n\nFlavoring should pair well with most Citrus flavorings. A few fruits such as Apple, and dragon fruit. Vanilla and tobaccos should also pair nicely.\n\n**Notes**\n\n\nPurchased this on a whim, I was interested to see how flavor West, combined these two profiles.  I have to say I am pleasantly surprised. This could easily be a single flavor mix or part of a complex profile. Reminds me a lot of Coke cans nebula recipe.\n\n**Rating**7\n\n80/100\n\nPlease if your opinion differs, or you have another review for this post , then leave a fucking comment. ;p\n","author":"Chrisdvr1","title":"Pineapple Peach","url":"https://redd.it/5reakc","vendor":{"name":"Flavor West","code":"FW"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FW","title":"Pineapple Peach"}},
