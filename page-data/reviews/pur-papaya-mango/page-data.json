Hint of mango? Tropical fruits.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Flavor Description:** Tropical fruit gum? If it wasn't labeled mango papaya, I would just describe it as tropical gum. When looking for it I do get hints of mango and papaya, but it just blends into a fruity gum. Has a noticeable throat hit at 5 days. At 2 weeks both the papaya and mango has matured into an authentic fresh fruit flavored gum. It's not an artificially flavored gum. The throat hit has calmed slightly, but it's still a bit harsh.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:** Gum\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit:** 4/10\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Pairings:** Coconut, melons, other tropical fruits. Cake, pastry?\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Notes:** Although the fruits themselves are authentically flavored, the gum really throws this one off. Probably 6-8% for a single flavor, maybe 1-2.5%.","author":"mysticrosell","title":"Papaya Mango","url":"https://redd.it/6s4rbj","vendor":{"name":"Purilum","code":"PUR"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"PUR","title":"Papaya Mango"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
