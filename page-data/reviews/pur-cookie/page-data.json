Just a hint of vanilla, the mouth feel is slightly moist and cakey. Not dry or grainy. This requires a longer steep and/or stronger percentage. The flavor is there, but I think it will be lost underneath other flavors other than providing body, so I am interested to see what happens with a full steep.\n\n10 Days:  This has surprised me with how much it strengthened with the longer steep time. The depth and strength has developed enough that I believe it will stand up to other flavors . A buttery fluffy shortbread cookie, with the breadiness being prominent rather than dry and crispy. It has a faint caramelization on the end of the exhale that gives it a lightly baked taste, with a sweet vanilla inhale. Its a spot on flavor of Lorna Doone shortbread cookies. Seems a good strength for a single flavor in the 4-6% range. Probably 1.5-3% in mixes.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:** None\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit:** 1/10\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Pairings:** Cookies, cakes, cereal, creams, custards, nuts, tobaccos, pie crusts, pastries, smoothies or shakes, jammy type fruits, icing, frosting, butter, maple.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Notes:** I really like this, it's a true bready yet still crisp cookie, buttery and with enough sweetness to say I'm a cookie while still not going to sugar cookie. I don't get dryness from this like I do with FA cookie. I do like FA cookie as well, but's it's more a generic crispy cracker type cookie, missing the butter and very little sweetness compared to this one.\n\n&nbsp;","author":"mysticrosell","title":"Cookie","url":"https://redd.it/62r8lq","vendor":{"name":"Purilum","code":"PUR"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"PUR","title":"Cookie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
