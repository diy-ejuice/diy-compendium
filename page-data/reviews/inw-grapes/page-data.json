Slightly candy-like, but also carries an earthiness resembling an actual grape.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Nothing really off unless you don't care for the earthiness.\n\n**Throat hit:** 6/10. \n\n**Uses:**  Decent as a standalone grape given its complexity, but could definitely be used as an accent or mid note, or in a fizzy type of recipe.\n\n**Pairings:** Other fruits, champagnes/colas/others of the like.\n\n**Notes:**  I can't really pinpoint whether I taste green or purple grape, sweet or tart, earthy or candy.  It's definitely got a lot going on.  I'm going to open a couple windows to let the haze out of my kitchen and call this one done for now.\n\nEDIT: [Link to all of our flavor reviews in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)\n","author":"wh1skeyk1ng","title":"Grapes","url":"https://redd.it/4o59bx","vendor":{"name":"Inawera","code":"INW"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"INW","title":"Grapes"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
