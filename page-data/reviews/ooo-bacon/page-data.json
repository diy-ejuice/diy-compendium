It's Bacon.\n\nAt 1-2 percent, it's a nice accent note, little maple, lil smokey. Will blend in well with both. At 3  percent, you get a nice juicy maple flavor, hearty wood smoke, and meat. I mean, really, it's bacon. This is the kind of level where you'll go, hey, what is that? You're twigging to the fact it's bacon, but not quite there if you didn't know. At 5%, it is unquestionably bacon, but after a week of steep, the unthinkable is about to leave my fingers here. TOO MUCH BACON. Yeah, I know, but it's sadly true. I'd say maybe 4% tops.\n\nPairs well with: smoke, maple, bakeries, cereal. Should also pair well with apple, pineapple...probably the usual suspects you'd find on a pizza or served with ham, to be honest.\n\nBest at around 5 days on steep, lasts about a month or so.\n\nRun on a Dead Rabbit @ 440f dual 24g ss 10 wrap","author":"Kitu5","title":"Bacon","url":"https://redd.it/7jno7f","vendor":{"name":"One On One","code":"OOO"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"OOO","title":"Bacon"}},
