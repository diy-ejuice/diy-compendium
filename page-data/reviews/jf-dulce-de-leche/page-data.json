Extremely dense 10/10\n\n**Throat Hit**\n3/10\n\n**Flavor Properties**\n\n\nThis flavoring can be broken down into several different parts Dairy, Caramel, and vanilla.\n\nCaramel - simply put delicious, light and sweet all still adding a heavy candy flavoring. There is a slight nutty flavor to the caramel that helps fill the flavoring out and gives it a unique quality.\n\nVanilla - the vanilla and this pairs perfectly with the sweet caramel. Accentuating the sweetness and taking the Nutty candy flavor to the next level.\n\nDairy - a heavy creamy Dairy, getting the flavor is smooth finish. Adding a very chewy aspect to the flavoring. The dairy aspect of this I believe is what makes it such a thick flavoring.\n\n**Relatable Flavors**\n\nSoft chewy caramel or even caramel ice cream topping.\n\n**Position In The Recipe**\n\nYou can see this flavor you being used in many applications it has the density to be a base flavor. Could easily be used to accent other candies, especially caramel, and butterscotch. And it is strong enough to come across as a top note at high percentages \n\n**Off Flavors**\n\n Jungle flavors seems to be killing it with very accurate and usable flavorings. I could not find anything wrong with this flavoring.\n\n**Pairings**\n\nI can see this pairing with almost everything. Should play nicely with all other candies. Add a little something unique  two tobacco's like soho and ry4. Creams and  bakeries should pair extremely well. Spice flavorings such as vanilla cardamom cinnamon or even anise.\n\n**Notes**\n\n\nAlright what is Dulce de leche? Basically it is sweetened milk, the sugars in the milk have been lightly caramelized turning it into a very rich and creamy caramel flavor.\n\nThis is going to be a versatile flavoring all of us should have in our Arsenal. I have been looking for the perfect light Caramel and I believe this is a likely candidate. Even though this flavor is incredibly dense  the caramel flavoring is not too heavy, on top of that it is creamy giving you that nice soft chewy  caramel drizzle. \n\nMixers of all experience levels should find this flavoring very useful. And definitely going to be needing a larger bottle 10 milliliters is just going to go so fast.\n\n**Rating**\n99/100\n\nOne last thing ECX is only selling this in 10 milliliter bottles, this flavoring is fantastic, and it is my understanding was almost discontinued. let's make sure that doesn't happen. Order yours today, thank me later. While you're at it please request they start selling this flavoring in larger amounts.\nWill be doing a more comprehensive review for DOD subscribers.","author":"Chrisdvr1","title":"Dulce de Leche","url":"https://redd.it/5p092a","vendor":{"name":"Jungle Flavors","code":"JF"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"JF","title":"Dulce de Leche"}},
