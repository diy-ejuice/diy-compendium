Very vibrant generic fruitiness with a very authentic gummy candy flavor. Sweet and tart, and juicy. This is not like real fruit gummy bears, it's the actual gummy candy. Pretty strong at this percentage.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:** Unpleasantly strong artificial and faint chemical taste for the first week.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit:** 3/10\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Pairings:** Any fruit. Or combination of fruits. Candy.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Notes:** This isn't a SF candidate for my tastes, but I would keep it around 7% if going for it. I'm thinking 2-5% with pretty much any fruit flavors or blends would be really good.","author":"mysticrosell","title":"Gummy Candy","url":"https://redd.it/5mwyh6","vendor":{"name":"Purilum","code":"PUR"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"PUR","title":"Gummy Candy"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
