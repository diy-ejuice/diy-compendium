Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Vape Train Sweet Raspberry, 3% and 7%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 14 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Very candied “red” fruit flavor.\n\nThis tastes a whole lot like swedish fish.  Probably more generically red than anything I’d identify as a raspberry.  Same kind of red currant or lingonberry candy thing going on without much in the way of realism or freshness.    Feels more generically red than the sweeter raspberry concentrates like FW Razzleberry or TPA Sweet Raspberry.  Some really light tartness, but overall seems warm and flat.  Nothing floral, but the top notes seem pretty dead.  Also not getting much in the way of juiciness or fleshiness here.\n\nI’m picking up something just a bit muddy and savory on the back of the flavor.  Almost like a light ketchupy off note. Probably less present than in TPA Sweet Raspberry, but feels like the same kind of off-note.  Sweeter flavor overall, which fits in with that whole swedish fish thing. Mouthfeel is just a bit sticky, but overall the flavor seems a bit thin.  The actual body of this flavor, at least at the tested percentages, doesn’t really seem to fill in for me.\n\n**Off-Flavors:**  Tastes more “red” than raspberry.  Light ketchup off-flavor.  Vapes a bit thin for the level of sweetness here.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Not really.  Not picking up any really harsh here.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 3%,  This feel really light to me.  I’m getting a clear swedish fish type flavor, but not much body or saturation.  Lightly sticky, but feels thin.\n\nAt 7%,  a bit fuller but still feels kind of hollow.  Clear “red” flavor, nothing that feels like a realistic or even clear candy raspberry.  Sticky, sweet, but thin.\n\nVape train suggests using this from 4-6% in a mix and 6-12% standalone.  That’s a bit higher than usual VT Range so I mixed up a tester at 12%.  Granted, I’ve only got about 3 days on that one, but the higher percentages don’t really seem to fill this out.  I’d still say it’s sticky, a bit airy, sweet, and “red.”  Just based on these tests, I’d be mixing with this around 8-10% as a primary note, although it would proably need something else going on to fill it in a bit.  Would work fine as a hint of swedish fish at 3-4%. \n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I can’t really get around the swedish fish thing.  Would probably pair up well against CAP 27 Fish to fill that out a bit and coast on the more candied mouthfeel there.\n\nMixed up against fruits, it isn’t really going to taste bad, just not much like a raspberry.  Could fill out a candy profiles where you already have your texture nailed down.  Could add some oomph to red licorice profiles, or maybe sweetening up a blue raspberry base.\n\nTastes a bit sweet and generic to really use a realistic fruit in cream, custard, or bakery mixes. \n\n**Second Opinions:**  I’m not finding anything via Google. \n\n[Here’s the product page from Vape Train.
