INW really nailed it on the head with this one. It's got a bit of a sharp tartness to it, with some sweetness that's reminiscent of an under-ripe strawberry, and a slight sort of fresh celeryesque taste to it. It is quite sharp/pungent at first, but mellows out in to something beautiful after a steep. This flavor makes a great star of the show as well as accent to other fruits or herbal profiles. This flavor is pretty forward, so it's definitely going to be playing towards the top of the profile. \n\n**On the Nose**  \nSomewhat sharp and tart. Smells like if you got some juice from rhubarb on your finger when slicing it up.\n\n**Recommended Usage**  \n*Stand alone*: 0.75-1%\n\n*In a mix*: 0.25-0.75%. \n\n**Throat**  \nMild to Moderate\n\n**Ideal Pairings**  \nBright fruits, Creams, Bakeries \n\n**Avoid**  \nDarker flavors; the brightness of the rhubarb & darkness of other flavors will clash.\n\n**Steep**  \n5-7 Days\n\n**Recipe Idea: [Rhubarb Custard Bar](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/9611)**  \n*Ratio: 15PG/85VG*  \n*Steep: 5+ days* \n\n**Ingredient**|**%**|\n:--|:--|\nFLV Vanilla Custard|1.5%|\nFLV Pound Cake|1.5%|\nINW Rhubarb|0.5%|\nLA Cream Cheese Icing|1%|\nFA Cookie|0.5%|\n\n\nHere you can really taste the Rhubarb without too much else getting in the way, since all the other flavors act more in the background. The Rhubarb brings a nice bright freshness to a somewhat dense and heavy mix, without clashing with those properties. There are a lot of spins you can put on this such as some INW Biscuit to accent the breadiness and make it a touch more buttery/flakey, as well as some Cheesecake or Meringue to accent the Cream Cheese Icing.
