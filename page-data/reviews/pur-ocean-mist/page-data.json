Pretty artificial. Tastes somewhere between an Ocean Spray Grape-Cranberry and Grape Kool Aid. There’s a nice dark, candy grape flavor shining through. It has a somewhat cool finish and is not very ‘juicy’ on its own. I find it lacks body for a juice at here at 7% but it is very tasty standalone. \n\n\n**I recommend this at 8-10% by itself *or with a touch of INW cactus and koolada*.**\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Nothing really. Its got a little bit of cranberry peeking through but I think that was intended.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Mild to none (1/10)\n\n**Uses:**  Grape Drink! This is going to be used mainly for drink recipes, candies or just straight up fruit blends. Works great as a grape/light cranberry base. I find the cranberry stands out more after about a month and the darker grape notes die out. This blends well with other flavors in personal use from 4-10% anything less than 4% gets lost easily.\n\n**Pairings:**  Fruit pairings: Some berries (strawberry/cranberry come to mind first), mango, pear, apple, guava, pomegranate, exotic fruits, more grape? and definitely prickly pear (cactus). This can work with vanilla if you like that sort of thing. Definitely a great concentrate to make grape drinks or candies. Citrus can work sometimes but flavors like FA lime tahity may not play well with this one.\n\n**Notes:** Definitely a great shake and vape flavor. After a couple of weeks the grape fades and the cranberry stands out a little more. At 9-10% it steeps better and is my preferred standalone for this one.\n\nA quick shake and vape recipe I like is:\n\nPR Ocean Myst 9%\n\nKoolada .5%\n\nINW Cactus .3%\n\nNN Erythritol 2%\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nNot a lot out there on this one and it is the only grape flavor I own. \n\nThere’s three reviews on Nicotine River’s site all very positive stuff.\n\n**If you decide to pick this up or maybe you just need a reason to, check out my Skittles recipe, it’s a simplified version of another skittles recipe I found. Ocean Myst pulls its weight in that recipe and I think it came out fantastic. Shake it vape it and love it**\n\nhttps://alltheflavors.com/recipes/26122#skittles_v1_by_vdevil \n\n\n**Side-note:** on ATF this is still Nicotine River Ocean Myst, or NR ocean myst. Same stuff.\n\n\nEdit: removed a word","author":"HashSlingingSlashur","title":"Ocean Mist","url":"https://redd.it/5nlqau","vendor":{"name":"Purilum","code":"PUR"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"PUR","title":"Ocean Mist"}},
