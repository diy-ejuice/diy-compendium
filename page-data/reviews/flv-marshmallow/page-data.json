Very \"pillowy.\"\n\n**Throat Hit** 1/10           \n\n**Flavor Properties**\n\nMore like marshmallow filling than actual marshmallow. Sweet, almost a light floral vanilla. Very hard to describe, besides that all the flavors are mellow and subdued.\n\n**Relatable Flavors** \n\nFA Marshmallow at a very low percentage, a single drop of INW vanilla shisha in 10mL with EM on top.                       \n                            \n**Off Flavors** \n\nThis flavor isn't strong enough to cover the flavor of VG. May dump half and mix 50/50 and edit this thread.\n\n**Position In The Recipe** \n\nSmooth out rough edges. I can't think of any complete recipe that could benefit from this. It could definitely help some unfinished recipes reach completion. \n\n**Pairings** \n\nPastries, creams, banana, peach, apple, pear, perhaps some bold tobaccos.           \n\n**Notes**                \n\nThis is a pre-release sample.  \n\n**Rating** B+, they achieved what they were going for, but not entirely.    \n\n*Please if your opinion differs, or you have another review for this post it in the comments. Will help the master list with multiple reviews in one spot.*","author":"skiddlzninja","title":"Marshmallow","url":"https://redd.it/4qynl3","vendor":{"name":"Flavorah","code":"FLV"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FLV","title":"Marshmallow"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
