Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Waffle @ 1% and 1 drop per 10ml, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 7 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  This one is... interesting. If anyone has insight here, for the love of god, share it with the rest of the class. Used super low, it almost tastes like a sweet whole grain bread, with some doughy notes.  Anything over .15% and I'm getting some serious earthy, almost astringent (like FLV Rhubarb) notes.  I'm having a lot of trouble seeing this as a waffle flavor.  I think this may have niche use in boosting aromatic tobaccos, but it's going to be a pretty small niche.\n\nInhale has a vegetal, slightly astringent sweetness. Decent body, but pretty odd.  Exhale has some doughy notes up front.  Could theoretically be a waffle batter, but I'm missing any of the crispier, sweeter texture of a waffle.  Top notes start off with an almost sour, slighty yeasty, tang and pick up a bitter vegetal astringency.  Like raw rhubarb actually. Moderately full with some sweetness here, but nothing that really reads as anything that should be near a waffle.  That vegetal note ends up lingering quite a bit, turning almost acrid like the top notes from an overcooked waffle. I'm a bit stumped.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  I can't really see this tasting much like a waffle, but maybe it's just going to take a better mixer than me to figure it out.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Used low, no real throat hit.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I may just be lacking in imagination or technical skill here, but this seems like no part of an actual waffle. There's some doughyness, but even down low there's a pretty serious vegetal quality to this.\n\nI can see this being used as a tobacco additive, but again pretty low. It would take a non-aromatic tobacco and add some bready and green leafy notes.\n\nThere may be some use here in making your bready desert base pick up some whole grain nuance or maybe a light griddled note, but I don't know if thats a thing that people are into.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, this is super concentrated and super finicky. After my initial tests, I went back and made a 10% dilution.  At .1% (less than 1 drop per 30ml), I get a sweet whole grain bread in the top notes. No really body down this low, but the top notes have a pretty aggresive presence. .15% is starting to taste like that grain has sprouted a bit, I'm getting some odd crisp green notes, especially towards the end of the exhale. .2% is pushing earthy pretty hard. That green note is a little astringent.  At .25% that green note is dominating the back of the exhale and colonizing the inhale.  Just for laughs, trying my sample at 1%, it's really astringent and funky.  The bread is pretty lost underneath that vegetal note.  I'd maybe use this at .1% to whole grain up a bread base, and maybe .2% for a tobacco additive.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[One review on BCF, user \"Brad\" gives it 4 stars and says: \"Not a stand alone imo. Kinda \"raw doughy\" taste and feel. Better when I added some berry flavors. No syrup flavor I could notice. Like a under cooked fresh waffle, batter kind of flavor. Still good for the collection.\"](http://www.bullcityflavors.com/waffle-flv/)  So I'm defintely not agreeing here.\n\n[One note on ELR, by user \"Brian_SFL\": \"nope. nothing like waffle to me. .\"  He still gave it two stars though, so?](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/122877)\n\n[Heres the Flavorah product page.  Their description: \"Great dough and waffle notes hit up front in the mouth. Think of a Belgian waffle without berries or whipped cream, but those can be added.\"](http://store.flavorah.com/concentrated-waffle-flavor)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**\n\n**[Suggestions for reviews?
