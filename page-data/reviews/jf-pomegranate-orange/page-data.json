Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** JF Pomegranate Orange @ 3%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 17 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  At low percentages, a candy blood orange flavor with the blood part of the orange pushing toward sweet-tarts. At a higher percentage, pink bubblegum flouride treatments. \n\nInhale is sweet citrus, A blood orange flavor as opposed to something like a navel orange. Sweeter than real blood orange and the \"blood\" part is pretty mild. Relatively soft zest flavor builds through the inhale.  Sweet pomegranate top note is right up front on the exhale lacking most of the tartness of real pomegranate but with a candy sweet-tarts taste.  Medium dense and almost chalky.  You have a decent fleshy orange underneath that with quite a bit of sweetness and some juiciness.  The overall effect tastes a whole lot like pink bubblegum through the first half of the exhale.  The tartness comes through on the back end of the exhale just as that pomegranate note thins out substantially, leaving you with a odd not quite astringent medicinal flavor.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Flouride.  It's the weirdest thing, but overall this tastes like (and smells like after its vaped) like dentist office flouride rinses.  Maybe it's just a specific sense memory for me, but this is dead on for that at 3%.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Light, mostly a tightness in the throat on exhale.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Under 1% I think the ecx reviews are dead on and this would work for a sweet-tart.  Definitely a candy flavor. Most of your candy texturizers are going to work well on that flouride finish. That chalky note is going to be the deal breaker on mixing this with other fruits, creams, or bakeries.\n\nAbove 1%, This may have a use in your classic pink bubblegum or even like a fruit stripe flavor but that flouride flavor is going to be a bear to work around.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nS&V testing, percentage used is important.  The orange part of this is present and recognizable at 1%, while the pomegranate / blood orange and the attendant chalky candy taste isn't unpleasant.  Definitely present, but still manageable.  Over 1% though and that flouride comes through really clearly while the orange gets a bit muted.  I'd stick to mixing this at 1% or under, using this as your primary flavor note with other concentrates contributing more to mouthfeel and texture.  You may be able to get away with a sweeter candy strawberry or raspberry if you want to push this into a mixed berry flavor, although the chalky-ness is going to make it taste quite a bit like mixed berry Tums antacids.\n\nThis is definitely a bit odd.  It's not really in my wheelhouse, but I can see people being into candy vapes getting some mileage out of this.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Not really, although the ECX reviews are hilarious.](http://www.ecigexpress.com/diy-e-liquid/diy-e-liquid-flavors/jungle-flavors/pomegranate-orange-by-jungle-flavors.html) Two people swearing off Jungle Flavors forever after this didn't work at 18 and 20%, and then everything else just calling them dense.  No real notes about the flavor.\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Pomegranate Orange","url":"https://redd.it/5j86ln","vendor":{"name":"Jungle Flavors","code":"JF"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"JF","title":"Pomegranate Orange"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
