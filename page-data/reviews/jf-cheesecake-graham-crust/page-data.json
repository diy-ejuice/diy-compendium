I was expecting this to be a little more concentrated, but it seems to be scaled the same as the TFA version. TL;DR: see [TFA Cheesecake (Graham Crust)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/4o45pd/tfa_cheesecake_graham_crust_flavor_review/)\n\n**Off-flavors:** none\n\n**Throat Hit:** none\n\n**Uses & Pairings:** almost anything. i would use a little of both this and TFA to get the best of both the cheesecake from JF and the crust from TFA instead of the usual CAP NY cheesecake+TFA cheesecake graham crust combo if you don't like CAP NY cheesecake.\n\n**Notes:** holds up to a steep! \n\n**Second Opinions:** Brian via ECX review: \"Very happy with this one. The graham cracker crust in particular is what sets this apart. Great flavor.\"\n\nWood via ECX review: \"seems to be a mix between a tfa graham and a capella ny cheesecake. I get a bit of an odd aftertaste at 4% solo and its an OK flavor but not sure it gives me anything I dont already have with my other cheesecakes.\"","author":"PerennialPhilosopher","title":"Cheesecake Graham Crust","url":"https://redd.it/6k1apt","vendor":{"name":"Jungle Flavors","code":"JF"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"JF","title":"Cheesecake Graham Crust"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
