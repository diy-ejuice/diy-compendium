Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Decadent Vapours Cafe Brasiliano, 5% and 10%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 52 days.\n**Flavor Description:**  Drip coffee with a sweet cream and drier bakery texture.\n\nFairly aggressive coffee flavor right up front.  I don’t know if it’s from brazil or not, but it’s more of a strong drip coffee type of taste rather than a more intense espresso.  Moderate to dark roast, with a bit of bitterness to it.  Coffee feels a bit more bold than FA Up, but it has that same kind of drip coffee vibe. Seems to have some of the same drawbacks as other coffee flavors.  On the big scale of coffee skunkiness, this isn’t awful though.  While it definitely doesn’t solve the whole burnt popcorn dilemma, it isn’t as skunky as some of the worst offenders.  On a scale of 1 to FA Dark Bean, I’d probably give it a 6?  While it has some of the same characteristics of the more aggressive coffee flavors it doesn’t feel completely incinerated and the flavor here is relatively robust for not feeling like a lump of carbon. \n\nThe description here calls out “a little cream” and I could see that.  It’s a bit lost behind that more dominant coffee note but I do pick up some kind of cream.  Feels quite a bit sweeter and fluffier than just like a flat cream flavor, feels a bit like whipped cream. Depending on the temperature and the wick saturation, I’ll occasionally get a flash of a buttery or waxy frosting type flavor, but overall it seems fairly cohesive.  The description also says this is lightly sweetened and that fits. Sweet but not cloying, seems to be attached more to the cream than the coffee.\n\nThis vapes pretty warm, which probably fits with the coffee profile, although it feels a bit dry.  It has an almost bakery like grain to it that doesn’t seem to quite fit with the description.  It’s probably just the coffee doing it’s thing, but it reminds me a bit more of a bakery than a hot cup of coffee.\n\nCoffees tend to decimate wicks, but this doesn’t seem especially bad.  No real coil gore, but my wicks are a little crunchy after 10mls.\n\n**Off-Flavors:**  Dryer bakery texture.  Usual weirder coffee burnt popcorn notes, but relatively workable.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light.  Nothing that really stings but can get a bit dry and harsh for me solo.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 5%, this is definitely coffee forward.  Heavy, but not burnt coffee flavor with some sweeter, fluffy cream backing.  Balance isn’t terrible, but could probably use some more cream. Moderately dry and sort of bakery-ish.\n\nAt 10%, that coffee is considerably more aggressive and is drowning out all of the cream for me. Seems even drier, and is starting to push toward burned and bitter.  Feels like overkill up here.\n\nDecadent Vapours has their usual 20% and adjust for taste thing, but I’m going to pass on that.  That coffee is already pretty aggressive at 10%.   I’d probably be fairly low on this, like 2-3% if you want to do anything but make a straight coffee vape. For those kind of vapes I’d probably kick up to 6-7% with some cream backup.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I don’t think is going to change anyone’s mind about coffee flavors, but it isn’t bad in the context of existing coffee flavors.    I’d use it a lot like FA Up in general, with a slightly bolder coffee flavor.\n\nYou could definitely add more cream.  There is already some richness here, so I’d more be focused on adding a lighter cream to kind of cut this back a bit and make it vape more like a beverage.  This might work well for a coffee ice cream though.\n\nDecent start for a tiramisu, especially with that sort of bakery dryness.  Good excuse to add a sponge cake type bakery and maybe some additional whip cream.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  [I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again… British juice review youtube is the best youtube.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeGkLznKYkQ)\n\n[Here is the product page from DV.
