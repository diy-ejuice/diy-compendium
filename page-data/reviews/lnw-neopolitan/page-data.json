First id like to say that this is not gross. I'm just not really getting a Neopolitan ice cream experience here; this is like the melted part at the bottom of the bowl where all the flavors have blended together. There is a definite chocolate and vanilla ice cream here, but it's kind of muddled. The strawberry is very subtle, but it pops up every now and then. This could be worth trying if Neopolitan ice cream is your white whale, although it needs help to pull it off, it could be useful.\n\n**Off-flavors:** nothing that doesn't belong in Neopolitan.\n\n**Throat Hit:** not really.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:** This will pull off the melted part of Neopolitan perfectly, or perhaps a Neopolitan milkshake! Maybe 5% is a good start, but I wouldn't go much higher. I would pair this with other strawberries and even chocolate and vanilla ice cream to go full Neopolitan.\n\n**Second Opinions:** none at this time.","author":"PerennialPhilosopher","title":"Neopolitan","url":"https://redd.it/6akj1e","vendor":{"name":"Liquid Nicotine Wholesale","code":"LNW"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"LNW","title":"Neopolitan"}},
