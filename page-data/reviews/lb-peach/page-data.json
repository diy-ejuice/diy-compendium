Shout out to Liquid Barn*\n\n**Setup:** Recoil w/ flavor barrel, Dual 15 wrap 26g 3mm Nifethal 70 coils @.17 ohms.  60w power, 450F temp limit. Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Liquid Barn Peach, 5 and 10%  @ 1g/ml, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 35 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  A light artificial peach flavor with a sharp edge and a butryic back-end.\n\nThe peach in here is a little hard to nail down.  I get a more yellow peach type of flavor, but it doesn't have those heavy peach rings kind of flavors you'd expect from that.  It's a bit on the artificial side, but it doesn't really call too much attention to itself.  Overall the peach isn't particularly aggressive or vibrant. It's kind of flat and indistinct.\n\nThere's a pretty sharp bite to this, which is a little weird for a 95% VG flavor.  Peach flavors can get fairly harsh, but it doesn't quite seem to translate to as much throat hit as I'd expect.  Sort of an acidic sharpness to the flavor though, and it almost gets a bit metallic with extended vaping.\n\nThis has a noticeable butryic accent to it.  It really reminds me of the sort of barnyard funk in a lot of green apple flavors.  It has that same body-odor bordering on grassy sour milk around the edges and especially on the tail end of the flavor.  It's not quite unsteeped V2 or DX levels of vomity, but it's definitely there, even after a longer steep.\n\nWith all that said, beyond the sharpness and the barnyard, there is a pretty decent texture here.  It's not quite juicy, more kind of mealy like a red delicious apple.  It's a bit hard to get through with the off flavors, but there's also an interesting thickness to the body of the fruit.\n\nThis has had a fairly long steep for a fruit, so that could have something to do with the lack of vibrancy.  Testing this as a S&V, those off-flavors are even more aggressive, so I'm thinking this is definitely a long steep kind of flavor even if that does affect the vibrancy.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  The weird barnyard-ish almost butryic funk is still pretty prominent after a steep.  I'm also getting something sharp and almost metallic here.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light to moderate throat hit, but a bit of a sharp and acidic mouthfeel right up front.  I'm not extremely sensitive to throat hit, but I can see this being more harsh if throat hit is an issue for you with other peach flavors.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 5%, the peach here is pretty soft but i'm getting an odd metallic taste on the backend.  Not particularly sharp, but that butryic edge is definitely still there if not too aggressive overall.\n\nAt 10% the peach here is a bit more solid and the backend feels less metallic.  This feels a bit acidic this high.  That butryic note is also quite a bit stronger.\n\nLiquid barn suggests mixing this at 10%, but that feels like too much of those off-notes.  Just based on these tests, I'd be using this a texturizing accent around 3-4%.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This is a deeply odd take on a peach flavor.  More than anything it reminds of a much less intense version of FLV Pear, with that kind of mealy texture and butryic note.  I was pretty skeptical about pear until trying Fear's [Bloody Mango Sorbet](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/55649#bloody_mango_sorbet_by_fear) with his sort-of recommended FLV Pear addition.  As unpleasant as FLV Pear is as a solo flavor, it does crazy things for texture.  I'm thinking you may be able to use this in a similar way.  I'd definitely be relatively low on this at around 3-4% and have a bunch of other bright fruits in the forefront to hide this one in the background.\n\nOutside of niche texturizing, I'm not sure this works well enough as a peach flavor to really recommend over other available peach options.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Here's the ELR Page.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/11665)  User \"jojo\" writes: \"6% (SnV - not super potent. A peach vibe but also a bit of a waxy or plastic taste. 1 week - still a very artificial peach flavor. I get peach, just not a great one. 2 weeks - Kinda generically sweet now. Very little peach. 3 weeks - sweet, peach flavor is weak. 4 weeks - pretty much the same. Ok, but not great.)\"  User \"LocoCarnage\" knows what I'm talking about with the funk to this: \"Very week peach flavor. Aroma in bottle is not pleasant, smells somewhat like an overripe peach with a bit of sweaty body odor. Vape is slightly sweet with a very faint peach flavor. Tested again at 3 weeks. Still sweet with very little peach flavor, got a faint taste of that sweaty body odor smell.\" \n\n[User \"Amy2\" has quick reviews up on the ELR Forum.  Her take: \"Guna be honest I am not a peach person but this one seems strong and not as sweet as a juicy peach.\"](http://forum.e-liquid-recipes.com/t/liquid-barn-tasting-notes/66705)\n\n[Liquid Barn's product page.  Their description: \"A juicy, perfectly ripe, sweet peach extract.\"  It's 95% VG and Liquid barn suggests mixing this at 10%.](https://www.liquidbarn.com/products/peach-eliquid-extract)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Peach","url":"https://redd.it/7cuo36","vendor":{"name":"Liquid Barn","code":"LB"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"LB","title":"Peach"}},
