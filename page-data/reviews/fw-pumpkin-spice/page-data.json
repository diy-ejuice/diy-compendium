I would give it 8 out of 10. Sharp and a little dusty.\n\n**Throat Hit** 5/10\n\n**Flavor Properties** \n\n Alright here we go. Pumpkin spice, a combination of nutmeg, cinnamon, and clove. This particular flavoring is heavy on the cinnamon and you get an earthy, woody, flavoring along with that cinnamon, which is very realistic in that regard.\n\nNutmeg is tricky, especially with all these other flavorings going on, but I'm definitely getting the perception of nutmeg.\n\nThe clove is almost non-existent which is perfect for me, as most pumpkin spice or holiday spice flavorings are far too heavy on the clove. Clove is a flavoring that is hard to do in small amounts and I would commend Flavor West for near leaving it out of this pumpkin spice. I taste it but it's just a whisper. With all other pumpkin spice flavorings I have tested, there is an overpowering clove that needs to be dumped down.\n\nAs far as the pumpkin flavoring goes, I'm not getting any squash. This more of a mixture of spices but it is creamy and dense along with the spices, giving some perception of a nice thick pumpkin pie with just an idea of the actual squash flavoring.\n\n\n**Relatable Flavors** \n\nFlavoring reminds me of the spices that go in pumpkin pie. As far as a standalone pumpkin pie flavor, it's going to need some help..\n\n**Position In The Recipe** \n\nThis flavoring could be very useful as an accent, but I feel the intent behind the flavoring was to make it a base flavor, and build off that. It's going to need some help.\n\n**Off Flavors**\n\nSuper dusty cinnamon and nutmeg combination was a little off-putting but authentic. After vaping about 5 milliliters, I'm unclear whether I would consider this an off flavor or just a really authentic representation of spices.\n\n**Pairings** \n\nFruits, berries, bakeries, vanilla, coffee, cream, and maybe some candies such as caramel and butterscotch.\n\nCould also pair well with a lot of other herb and spice flavorings.\n\n\n**Notes** \n\nI purchased several of these flavorings looking to make a spiced latte or pumpkin chocolate chip cookie. I'm afraid that the search goes on for that pumpkin flavoring I'm looking for to do the chocolate chip cookie.\n\nHere is a little information from Wikipedia if you're interested:\n\n https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumpkin_pie_spice\n\n Oh look there's allspice in here as well. That may also have been added to the dusty flavoring.\n\n**Rating** 85/100\n\n**Please if your opinion differs, or you have another review for this flavor add it in the comments.
