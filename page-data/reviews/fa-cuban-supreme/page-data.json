The overall flavor is mild and easy to vape.\n\n**Off-flavors:** After 4 weeks, something almost tastes burnt, not sure if it was intentional by the creators or not, but even for a former long time smoker, it isn't exactly a pleasant sort of burnt.\n\n**Throat hit:** 3/10 mild\n\n**Uses:** 0.5-1.5% as an accent or 3-4% if you really want to push the taste.  As a standalone, it's kind of boring at least for me.\n\n**Pairings:**  Other mild tobaccos, nuts, chocolate, coffee, spices, butterscotch, caramel, possibly a touch of dark fruit, or a little cream if you like.\n\n**Notes:** The aroma of this flavor is much like that of a fine cigar, however the overall vape doesn't exactly match.  I found it rather lifeless and boring, lacking the depth I enjoy with other tobacco flavors.\n\nFlavor available at BCF [here](http://www.bullcityflavors.com/cuban-supreme-fa/) \n\n[Link to e-liquid-recipes notes on this flavor](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/569)\n\n[Link to all of our flavor reviews in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)\n\n","author":"wh1skeyk1ng","title":"Cuban Supreme","url":"https://redd.it/6eakse","vendor":{"name":"Flavour Art","code":"FA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FA","title":"Cuban Supreme"}},
