It's not sweet at all, it provides a very heavy and dense cream mouthfeel. A very potent flavor with strong sour notes, it tends to take on the characteristics of what you mix it with. Hard to describe, when mixed with cheesecake it tastes very much like a tangy cream cheese. When mixed with yogurts it tastes like a thick Greek yogurt. Single flavor it's almost like a thick sour cream with slight cheesy notes.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:** Tanginess, cheesy?\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit:** 1/10\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Uses:** Excellent for adding tanginess to most any mix. Works well with other creams or dairy to tone it down. Excellent to add that cream cheese tang that is missing in all the cheesecake flavorings. I use this anywhere I want cream cheese flavor, cheesecakes, danishes, frostings. Fantastic for yogurts and some cereals too. Great with FLV frosting and/or LA Cream Cheese Icing as part of a base for cream cheese frosting.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Notes:** In mixes I use 1-2 drops up to 1%. My average seems to be .5%. Extremely potent and will overwhelm everything if not careful. Great dense mouthfeel, but even using it by the drops, the tang is noticeable so it won't work just for adding body. I can't make cheesecake without it. It works best with sweeteners in dessert or sweet applications. I don't use sweetener a lot, but it pairs well with this one.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Other opinions:** From ELR,  bluenose63: \"Hangsen best Cream out there for Bakery imho\". Bradslinux: \"If you want a REAL heavy and VERY RICH cream note, Italian Cream (Hangsen) is wonderful.\" DarthVapor: \" Italian cream has a really nice tangy-ness to it, akin to yogurt and..well...cheesecake\". Amy***: \"Heavy Heavy cream on the stern side and not a sweet cream more mascarpone like with a greek yogurt like tartness but cleaner tasting. Wonderful in desserts/bakery flavors. Have used 0.3-3% The more you use be sure to steep it so the flavor can relax and allow other flavors to develop.\"","author":"mysticrosell","title":"Italian Cream","url":"https://redd.it/7nf42k","vendor":{"name":"Hangsen","code":"HS"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"HS","title":"Italian Cream"}},
