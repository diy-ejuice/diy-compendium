Not enough flavour used? I'll keep dripping until it comes through. Slight sweetness maybe coming through now, but I'm really searching. If I was told this was unflavoured I'd believe you. Definitely need more than 2%\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAdded more conc, not 100% accurate now due to dripping some but it's around 4%, maybe slightly over and now trying off the shake. There's definitely a sweetness now that isn't just VG, I'm still not getting much in terms of tomato flavour.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBumped to \\~6%, again unsteeped. I'm now getting a little tomato flavour, albeit very wishy washy. What I'd imagine tasting the juice left on the knife from chopping some beef tomatoes would be like. Back to the cupboard with this one to see if any flavour comes out after a steep.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nChrisdvr1 uses FA Tomato Ripe @ 5% in a tomato soup recipe, the FlavourArt UK kitchen site only lists one tomato concentrate so I'm assuming this is the same. The tomato stands up to the creams, herb and pepper in that recipe according to the one review.\n\n[https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/7876#creamy\\_tomatum\\_soup\\_by\\_chrisdvr1](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/7876#creamy_tomatum_soup_by_chrisdvr1)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Possible usage?** I can't taste much so maybe I'm tomato blind as well as strawberry blind, who knows. Chris and the reviewer of the soup could obviously taste it so it works there. Possibly could be used in a bloody mary vape?","author":"horrend","title":"Tomato","url":"https://redd.it/agc37k","vendor":{"name":"Flavour Art","code":"FA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FA","title":"Tomato"}},
