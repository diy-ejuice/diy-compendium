Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** RF SC Butter Toffee @ 2% and 4%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 15 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** More Werther's than like a crisp, crunchy toffee flavor. Lighter buttery cream and blonde caramel.  I feel like a broken record with these RF SC flavors, but It's a good flavor, I just want more and I'm getting some structural issues. I'm getting a bit of throat hit, not so much a harsh bite but like a lingering heartburn kind of sensation. In the second opinions someone mentions a \"tickle\" in the throat, and that's a fairly decent description. A bit more linear than some of the other real flavors, Light but noticeable at 1%, and more solid by like 3%, although that weird harshness is getting pretty pronounced. I'd maybe use this as a backup for a butterscotch or caramel to stick behind a darker, dryer concentrate.\n\nInhale is buttery up front, but manages to be pretty airy.  Building blonde caramel sweetness, getting a bit sharp if you really push that inhale. eventually picking a bit of a citric sour edge. I'm not really noticing it unless we are talking really deep draws, but I feel like it's there. Exhale has a softer, buttery caramel. More like a butterscotch candy than a crispy, tarker toffee you'd get in a candy bar. Flavor falls off pretty sharply in the exhale.  Feels a bit watery by the time you hit the tail end.  Sweet, but insubstantial overall.  I'm still getting just a bit of that weird citric tartness as opposed to a a full, buttery, creamy flavor.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Thin, and a bit sour. Pretty blah by the time you hit the end of the vape.\n \n**Throat Hit:**  Odd. Not like stinging harsh, but kind of like heartburn, especially after some prolonged vaping.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  It's a buttery caramel-esque type of flavor lacking body, so it's hard to find a clear use for this. I could see it backing up dryer sharper caramel and butterscotch flavors like the FLV and FA Caramel and Butterscotches. If you don't get the weird thinness from these RF SC flavors, then the world is your oyster.  A buttery caramel will fit in tobaccos, bakeries, and even fruit mixes.\n\n**Notes:**  This is fairly linear. I think 1% is pretty light, but usable. More like a hint of butter. Caramel isn't really coming in clear and it doesn't feel thick enough for a toffee or full candy-style vape. 2% is a bit more solid. Caramelized sugar coming through a bit clearer, and there's more of full candy flavor. Still feels markedly thin on the tail end of the exhale. 3% is too different from 2%. Maybe a stronger butter, and heavier caramel at least up front. 4% is getting kind of weirdly harsh and sour. 5% just tastes sour and strange. I'd use this around 2-3%, if you don't run into the thinness issue.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Here's the ELR for the SC Version.  Two notes of note, really.  One says it's barely there after a month @ 3%, and one just complains it's harsh but praises the flavor. I come down more in the \"barely there\" camp, but I see the throat hit.]( http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/127943)\n\n[And here's the ELR for the VG Version. Common complaint that this weak. I think the VG base may exacerbate the problem, but I'm thinking it's not the VG that's the problem. This just isn't a really punchy flavor.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/80775)\n\n[Here's the product page from Real Flavors.  Their take: \"Butter toffee at its best!
