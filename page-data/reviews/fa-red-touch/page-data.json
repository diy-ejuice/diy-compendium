    "result": {"data":{"reviewsJson":{"markdown":"**Setup:** Plume Veil RDA; dual parallel @ .35Î©; cotton wicks; 45W\n\n**Testing:** FA Red Touch @ 4%; Aged: 8 days\n\n**Flavor description:**  A juicy strawberry rolled in sugar and pulverized into a velvety jelly.  Well rounded strawberry taste overall.  I taste a slight bit of candied strawberry in it, but reminds me of strawberry jelly with the seeds in it. (Preserves?)\n\n**Off-flavors:**  none at 4%\n\n**Throat hit:** 5/10. \n\n**Uses:**  Sweetens up bitter fruits or blends with other fruits to create a unique flavor profile.  Also great as a standalone.\n\n**Pairings:** Creams, other fruits/citrus, desserts.  0.5-1% TFA Dragonfruit makes this flavor pop a little more as well.\n\n**Notes:** With so many great strawberry flavors out there, I can't really say much besides try this one too.  You won't be disappointed.\n\nEDIT: [Link to all of our flavor reviews in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)","author":"wh1skeyk1ng","title":"Red Touch","url":"https://redd.it/4o4nwi","vendor":{"name":"Flavour Art","code":"FA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FA","title":"Red Touch"}},
