Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Boysenberry @ %1 and 1 drop per 10ml (about .25%), 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 8 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** A sweet candy dark berry, bordering on syrupy at higher percentages. Balanced tartness and a heavy, juicy mouthfeel.  A bit hard to place the actual berry flavor, but I don't get any medicinal red berry type of notes until around 4%.  A bit of harshness, but a sweeter take on a clear and fairly clean dark berry flavor.\n\nSharp and sweet tart berry inhale.  Not as deep as a blackberry, but without any of those camphor-y notes you get from red berries. A little warm and moderately dense with a bit of harshness. Candy blueberry / blackberry right up front on the exhale. Intensely sweet and still a bit tart. Mild blackberry floral top notes.  Prominent candy sweetness on the back end with some juiciness, bordering on a a sticky syrupy mouthfeel. Lingering sugar lips with tart and floral berry notes.\n  \n**Off-flavors:** Not really though it definitely leans towards candy with the level of sweetness here.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light, although it pushes more toward moderate as you push higher towards 3%.  The pretty intense sweetness here gets a bit rough.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  At lower percentages, has a bit of tartness and brightness that will add a bit of body to a more floral berry like raspberry or blackberry or some brightness to a really deep, syrupy berry flavor like FLV Blueberry.  At higher percentages, it's a good base for jammier berry flavors. I still want just a little bit more depth to really sell a berry filling though, so maybe add some Liquid Amber.\n\nPretty much perfect for berry candies.  Good fit in heavier creams and custards. Tastes a bit like the blackberry syrup they'll blend into milkshakes.  Should pair well with citruses for a dark berry lemonade kind of vibe.\n\n**Notes:**  S&V concentration testing, this is pretty forgiving. Even as low as .25%, there's a relatively bright, tart berry flavor with a solid sweetness. .5% is just a bit sweeter and fuller. 1% has a bit of syrupy, candy mouthfeel and the sweetness feels a bit more round. At 2%, the tartness of the berry is dying down a bit, and you're getting a blueberry hard candy type of taste.  At 3%, the berry is a little flatter, and the mouthfeel is getting a bit jammy. 4% is pretty intense, seems to be getting a bit too sweet and that berry is getting a bit medicinal.  5% is sweet, harsh, and sticky with a berry flavor that's creeping towards robitutssin.  For a brighter berry accent, I'd start at .5% and work up. For a fuller main note I'd start at 2% and work up.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[/u/Growing_plants had a religious experience: \"This stuff is amazing, I have been throwing it in everything from PB & J sandwich flavor to a nice jammy pastry and even cereal flavors (so far best berry addition I have used in any recipe). At light percentages (1~2%) it adds just a light sweet berry that has just a hint of tartness on the exhale, and at higher percentages it tastes dead on for knottsberry boysenberry jam.\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/3faumm/flavorah_boysenberry_ive_seen_the_light/)\n\n[/u/EnyaWreklaw uses this in his wild berry candy/juice recipe, Misty. His notes:  \"This flavoring is absolutely wonderful. This is one of the most popular Flavorah flavors for good reason. The flavor that comes with it is a wildly delicious and interestingly satisfying boysenberry flavor, which is pretty much a cross between a raspberry and blackberry with the sweetness turned up a notch.\"](https://diyordievaping.com/2015/11/20/lets-mix-misty-a-mixed-berry-juice-candy-recipe/)\n\n[Heres the FLV Product Page. Their description: \"Clear boysenberry notes. Great for mixing with fruits, or with bakery flavors for a jam filling. \"  All positive reviews on there, as well.](http://store.flavorah.com/concentrated-boysenberry-flavor)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Boysenberry","url":"https://redd.it/65aaol","vendor":{"name":"Flavorah","code":"FLV"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FLV","title":"Boysenberry"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
