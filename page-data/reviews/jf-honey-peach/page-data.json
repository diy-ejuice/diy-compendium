Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** JF Honey Peach @ 3%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 22 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** A relatively fleshy ripe / bordering on overripe peach. Pronounced green top notes, slightly perfumey overall, especially at higher percentages. Overall the concentrate has some juiciness but it feels strangely disjointed in the mix, almost divorced from the actual peach itself. The peach itself is a little dry. Sweetness is all down low in the flavor and front-loaded.\n\nInhale is heavy on perfume with a warm moderately dense juicyness and a solid sweetness. Exhale starts with a green peach / peel note moving onto more of the peach flesh. Some sweetness here, but all underneath the peach instead of actually in the flesh. Finish is clean, almost to point of tasting a little metallic.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  People report a raw honey taste here.  I personally don't get much of that, but YMMV.  I do get some metallic notes on the finish of the exhale, but damn near any other concentrate is going to have a lot more going on there and should take care of that when mixed.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Light, mostly in the form of chest tightness for me. Still much less pronounced than TPA Juicy Peach.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**\n\nPlenty of use out there already. My mind immediately goes to fruit mixes, just because of that dryer peel green note and needing some extra juiciness in the exhale. [/u/Philosaphucker uses it in their \"Kicking Rocks\" recipe right here.](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/16857#kicking_rocks_by_philosaphucker) Balanced with hazelnut, fig, pear, and blackcurrant.  [And again in their \"Nova\", with grapefruit, cactus, pear, and plum.](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/16868#nova_by_philosaphucker)\n\n\nThis peach note here would also work in beverages. [u/philosaphucker is obviously an ECX shill, with a awfully fine Peach bourbon recipe named \"Noted Talks.\"](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/15261#noted_talks_by_philosaphucker)  Similar to FLV Peach, this would a great fit for an Iced Tea as well.\n\n[Some use in bakeries, notably \"A Southern Peach\" by /u/trevorxgage.](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/16817#a_southern_peach_v1_by_trevorxgage) They cut that green note by using Kentucky Bourbon and Liquid Amber to cook the peach here.\n\nIt's worth noting that this concentrate may not play well with heavy creams and custards. [/u/EdibleMalfunction goes into this here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/53ozts/honey_peach_jf_issues/)\n\n**Notes:**\n\nS&V concentration testing, this seems pretty desaturated at .5% although I do get most of the juicyness at a low concentration. I get a denser stone fruit vibe at 1% and then the \"peachyness\" kind of scales up with some perfumey notes.  I'd mix at .5% for more of a fruity enhacement, 1% for a distinct peach in a mix, and maybe 1.5% as a primary note. If you can get the green notes under control, this is probably good a bit higher than that.\n\nThis is weird for me, it feels like the concentrate is sort of backwards. I get what I'd expect on the exhale on the inhale instead. It's a good peach flavor though, just watch where it's sitting in your mixes.  This is a case where the consensus seems to be quite a bit more positive than my notes.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nQuite a few quick mentions on reddit about it being good. [Here,](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/336wze/anyone_tried_jungle_flavors/) [here,](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/46m5f0/jungle_flavors_at_ecx/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/2o7fp1/ecigexpress_who_makes_signature_flavors/) are some examples.\n\n[Positive, not particulary descriptive reviews on ECX. The flavor description by ECX is helpful, although it talks about a clear honey note that I just don't get.](http://www.ecigexpress.com/diy-e-liquid/diy-e-liquid-flavors/jungle-flavors/honey-peach-by-jungle-flavors.html)\n\n[Downright reasonable single flavor percentage advice on ELR, and an actual note about this being an authentic peach flavor.](http://www.ecigexpress.com/diy-e-liquid/diy-e-liquid-flavors/jungle-flavors/honey-peach-by-jungle-flavors.html)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Honey Peach","url":"https://redd.it/5kil6y","vendor":{"name":"Jungle Flavors","code":"JF"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"JF","title":"Honey Peach"}},
