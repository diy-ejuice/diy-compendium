I could see this being closer to an artificial white chocolate than to the real deal, but thats not really a bad thing. \n\n**Off-flavors:** Nothing that i noticed\n\n**Throat Hit:** None to speak of.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:** Flavorah says \"White Chocolate is at home with whipped creams, and other dairy notes.\" at 1% this seems like a supporting flavor but i wouldnt use it much higher even as a main note. this could be used in basically any custard/cream/bakery profile to give a thicker creamy note. \n\n**Notes:** this is mild in comparison to the other FLV flavors ive tried so i could see the % being bumped up for some more kick.\n\n**Second Opinions:** \"Slightly chalky, very flexible and firm flavor has a full, chunky bar presence that can be scaled up and down as needed.\" [-from the Flavorah website](http://store.flavorah.com/concentrated-white-chocolate-flavor), no other opinions found; although, i did see that there is a review available for DIY or DIE fans.","author":"PerennialPhilosopher","title":"White Chocolate","url":"https://redd.it/604fgs","vendor":{"name":"Flavorah","code":"FLV"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FLV","title":"White Chocolate"}},
