Ripe without being cloying. Very authentic with good body and it blends very well with ginger :) At a 2 week steep the flavor on this has not changed very much, maybe the peach has a little more depth and density to it. The flesh of a ripe juicy sweet white peach without the fuzzy skin. It's a bright flavor, and I almost get a faint vanilla back note? This would be great with vanillas or FA Oba Oba would probably be amazing! \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:** None\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit:** 1/10\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Pairings:** Almost any fruit. Cookies, cakes, peach pie and cobbler, brandy, ice creams, nuts, vanilla, oba oba, ginger, cinnamon, creams and whipped cream, caramel, brown sugar, cloves, honey, maple syrup.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Notes:** This one will be good as a Shake & Vape or steeped. Single flavor in an RDA 6-8% and in tanks 7-9%. As an accent 1.5-5%.\n","author":"mysticrosell","title":"White Peach","url":"https://redd.it/5qau65","vendor":{"name":"Purilum","code":"PUR"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"PUR","title":"White Peach"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
