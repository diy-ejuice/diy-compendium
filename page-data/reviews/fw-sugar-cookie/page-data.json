But still very useful and worth having in the collection.\n\nAs always here is a Wikipedia on sugar cookies, and where you can buy it.\n\n https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar_cookie\n\n http://www.bullcityvapor.com/sugar-cookie-fw/\n\n**Rating** 75/100\n\n*Please if your opinion differs, or you have another review for this post it in the comments. Will help the master list with multiple reviews in one spot.*","author":"Chrisdvr1","title":"Sugar Cookie","url":"https://redd.it/4tdaqc","vendor":{"name":"Flavor West","code":"FW"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FW","title":"Sugar Cookie"}},
