Tastes very similar to the 99 cent 6 packs of glazed donuts you find at a gas station.  \n\n**Off-flavors:**  I don't taste anything off.  EDIT: Others are tasting Play-Doh.  Trying it as a standalone in a tank, I did get a slight Play-Doh nuance, but I don't taste that on my RDA.\n\n**Throat hit:** 6/10.  Thick and heavy in the mouth.\n\n**Uses:**  I haven't personally played with any additions, but would likely play well in a bakery or dessert recipe. \n\n**Pairings:** Berries, ice creams, nuts.  Would pair well with some INW Biscuit or FA Joy.\n\n**Notes:** Tastes great as a shake-n-vape, steeps out very well also.  Very enjoyable as a 5% standalone flavor.  I feel that Capella really nailed this flavor. \n\nEDIT: [Link to all of our flavor reviews in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)","author":"wh1skeyk1ng","title":"Glazed Donut","url":"https://redd.it/4o4f0h","vendor":{"name":"Capella","code":"CAP"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"CAP","title":"Glazed Donut"}},
