It's caramel if anything and very hard to detect, once you notice it, it's gone\n\n**Mouth Feel:**\n\n- medium density\n\n**Off Flavors:**\n\n- none\n\n**Position In A Recipe:**\n\n- accent, use in small amounts to add the smoke/burning note to your tobacco mixes\n\n**Suggested Percentage:**\n\n- max 3%, most would say 0.5-1%\n- it can and will overpower mixes above 1%\n\n**Pairings:**\n\n- taken straight from someone else's notes:  Get your tobacco recipe to your liking, then add\nBlack Fire in small steps, just 0.25% at a time, for a realistic smoke effect.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- Will fit into any \"oh my god this tastes like tobacco\" blend.\n- At 3% it's kinda harsh, even for me and I don't mind my vapes rough around the edges.\n- FA Black Fire and INW Dirty Neutral Base are cousins and do share similarities.\n- Black Fire is smoke but no ash tray taste and it has that slight sweetness. INW DNB has some smoke to it but really adds that acrid ashy note which kicks in about halfway through a smoking a cigarette. It also has zero sweetness.\n- They can certainly be used together, low in the mix, to get you as close to burning tobacco as possible.\n- If I had to choose only 1, I would go with Dirty Neutral Base.\n- I went in hard at 3%, it was uncalled for, I regret nothing.\n\n**Second Opinion**\n/u/ConcreteRiver did a thorough review of Black Fire which you may also want to check out [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/5ns9e2/fa_black_fire/)","author":"T_Mace","title":"Black Fire","url":"https://redd.it/670w77","vendor":{"name":"Flavour Art","code":"FA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FA","title":"Black Fire"}},
