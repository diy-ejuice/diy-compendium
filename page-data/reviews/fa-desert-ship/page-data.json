I'll describe below)\n\n**Flavor Properties:**\n\n- earthy\n- dark\n- touch of spice\n\n**Relatable Flavors:**\n\n- first off, it has that FA \"charred green pepper\" note that I described for FA Latakia and others\n- cocoa/bakery undertones\n- earthy, wet dirt or leaves note\n\n**Mouth Feel:**\n\n- medium body\n\n**Off Flavors:**\n\n- none technically\n\n**Position In A Recipe:**\n\n- main note or accent but please read conclusion\n\n**Suggested Percentage:**\n\n- 1-3%\n\n**Pairings:**\n\n- tobaccos\n- creams\n- nuts\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- I categorized it as non-aromatic because it's not heavily flavored with toppings but in reality, this does not taste like tobacco in any way.\n- If you've tried FA Latakia or Dark Vapure and enjoyed it, you will probably like this one.\n- Personally, I will just come out and say it, I don't like this at all. Not even one bit. There are way better options in tobacco land.\n- This flavor will be familiar to anyone who has tried several commercial tobacco flavors. It's been used a lot.\n- I don't see myself using this ever. Maybe some people enjoy it, but it's just not for me.","author":"T_Mace","title":"Desert Ship","url":"https://redd.it/6bd7xg","vendor":{"name":"Flavour Art","code":"FA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FA","title":"Desert Ship"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
