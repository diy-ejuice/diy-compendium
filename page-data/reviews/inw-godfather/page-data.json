It is backed by a fairly thick and soft almond texture/taste, along with a hint of something citrusy and bright.  It is rather thick in the mouth with a delicate taste behind it.  I personally do not taste any whiskey, as this flavor is supposed to mimic a whiskey-amaretto cocktail.  I feel like I get mostly the amaretto part.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Occasionally, right at the end of my inhale/the beginning of my exhale, I get something resembling burnt plastic or rubber, almost like butyric acid.  It isn't every time, but it is there more than I care for it to be, and maybe 3% is bringing out the weirdness, I'm not sure.\n\n**Throat hit:** 4/10, mostly smooth but the citrus note does throw in a bit of throat hit.\n\n**Uses:** This would work well as part of a cocktail recipe or as an additive in a tobacco recipe.  I'd keep it under 3% though.  It would also probably work well to \"soften\" up a fruity or nutty recipe a bit under 1%.\n\n**Pairings:**   Tobaccos, creams, nuts, coffee, booze flavors.  \n\n**Notes:**  I really wanted to like this flavor, since I'm a huge fan of INW, but I personally can't get far enough past that occasional burnt plastic taste to make myself use it in a recipe yet.  I do think with the right additives and flavor layers it would work out fine, I just don't feel like travelling down that route quite yet.  If anyone else has ANY experience with this flavor, I'm interested.\n \n[Link to all of our flavor reviews in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)\n\n","author":"wh1skeyk1ng","title":"Godfather","url":"https://redd.it/5ottpp","vendor":{"name":"Inawera","code":"INW"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"INW","title":"Godfather"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
