Very dense for fruit flavor I give it 7 out of 10.\n\n**Throat Hit** 2/10          \n \n**Flavor Properties** \n\nA sweet and tart blueberry, emphasis on the sweet, and I don't know how else to describe it but it tastes blue. \n\n**Relatable Flavors** \n\nWhat I would expect blueberry sucker or Jolly Rancher you taste like, also reminds me of blue popsicles.\n\n**Off Flavors** \n\nNothing I can really picke out it is overly sweet, but I'm testing it a little high and it does have a lingering aftertaste but it is not unpleasant.\n\n**Position In The Recipe** \n\nDue to its  thick density, is going to be a great base note. Low percentages can be used to round out other blueberries ,and believe and should take the top note position in a cream recipe.\n\n**Pairings** \n\nOther berries, bakeries, citrus and other fruits, tobacco's, creams, and cereals.\n\n**Notes** \n\n\n\nhttps://www.google.com/search?q=blueberry+candy&client=ms-android-att-us&biw=360&bih=511&tbm=isch&prmd=sivn&source=lnms&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiQ2I2xs7_NAhWG3SYKHXXlBQEQ_AUIBigC#imgrc=sUe02Cr1yI7m5M%3A\n\nA very good blueberry\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blueberry\n\nhttp://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/n-arxsrf/q51ae6vv/products/1318/images/4237/HS_Blueberry__88316.1427910584.1280.1280.jpg?c=2\n\n\n**Rating** 75/100      \n\n*Please if your opinion differs, or you have another review for this post it in the comments.
