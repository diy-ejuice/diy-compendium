Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** CAP Grapefruit @ 4%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 8 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Bright.  Medium sweet on the inhale with a faint grapefruit flesh taste. Exhale brings out some sourness and bitterness with a citrus rind sting.  Well balanced if a bit simple grapefruit. Kind of tastes like the missing link between FW Blood Orange and FW Ruby Red Grapefruit.  It could just be the sourness but I get a mild bit of effervescence here.\n\n**Off-flavors:** None.\n\n**Throat Hit:** 7/10.  It's there, but not out of line for a citrus.\n\n**Uses:** Accent flavor for fruit mixes.  Volume for a citrus mix.  Effervescence would lend itself to something like Grapefruit soda or a cocktail recipe. \n\n**Pairings:**  I'd stay away from bright harsh flavors like green apples and pears. Berries, Pineapple, Guava, Pomegranate.  Creams.  Too bright and harsh for bakeries, or spices. Cactus for juiciness.\n\n**Notes:** This is pretty solid.  I had a vial hidden in some older supplies from a Wizard Labs order and decided to give it a shot.  Apparently the market is lousy with decent to good grapefruit concentrates.  I still prefer FLV Pink Guava for an interesting grapefruit, and FW Ruby Red Grapefruit for a more robust sweet grapefruit juice.  This has real potential though, especially is the carbonation holds up in a mix.  It tastes more like a sweetened white grapefruit, instead of an inherently sweet ruby red grapefruit.  All in all, a really pleasant surprise.  4% seems like a really solid single flavor percentage.  The bitter notes are fairly subdued for a grapefruit, so at lower percentages it should add to a mix without being too distracting.  Unobtrusive and tasty.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Reddit agrees CAP Grapefruit is... ok.  Check the comments.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/2w9804/how_can_i_get_grapefruit_to_pop/)\n\n[Soda recipe on ATF](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/12708#lilt_by_kepinskiuk)\n\nNot a super popular flavor.  BCF just added it.  WL has had it for a while.  Used pretty sparingly on ATF and ELR.  For what it's worth I agree with both the OP and the comments from that Reddit link.  CAP grapefruit is a bit flat compared to competition.  I'm excited to test the carbonation part of this, but it wouldn't be my first choice.\n\n[You into grapefruit? Check this out...
