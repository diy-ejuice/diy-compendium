Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Marshmallow Treat @ 3%, 70/30 VG/PG, Steeped 21 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Really weird rice krispies treats. Moderately fluffy malty inhale with a dry medium sweet exhale.  Not quite a vanilla note on the exhale.  I wouldn't call it marshmallow exactly, either. It doesn't taste overtly artificial, just odd.  Higher wattage and heat doesn't really help this out or make the concentrate work any better, it just pushes the off flavors higher in the mix and makes them stronger.\n\n**Off-flavors:** The krispies part of this has a strong cardboard vibe.  Lingering subtle sweet anise or stewed basil taste after exhale on the marshmallow.\n\n**Throat Hit:** 4/10.  A little dry and a little harsh. \n\n**Uses:**  I'm struggling with thinking of a use here.  To use it as a base for rice krispies treats you would need to reinforce the rice krispies, and the marshmallow, and some buttery richness.  At that point, this concentrate would be unecessary.  The only possible use I'd come up with would be as a malty texturizer, although you'd be better served just using something like FW Rice Krispies or what ever they are calling it now.\n\n**Pairings:**  Your guess is as good as mine.  It would work with sweet stone fruit or juicier berries.  Maybe sweeter chocolates. Creams.\n\n**Notes:** This is just weird, and not particulary effective.  The concentrate itself instantly turned my pg/vg mix kidney failure yellow and opaque when mixed.  It's just full of off-flavors.  It's vapeable, just not pleasant or useful as far as I can tell.\n\n[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Marshmallow Treat","url":"https://redd.it/5bngq9","vendor":{"name":"Flavorah","code":"FLV"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FLV","title":"Marshmallow Treat"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
