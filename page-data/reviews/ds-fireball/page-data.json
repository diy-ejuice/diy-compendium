Flavor @ 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2%.\n\n**Notes:** Imagine a cinna-mint, but swap the mint with menthol. This is a mentholated candy cinnamon flavor (think Hot Tamales). The menthol is more of an accent and less of a main player. Like menthol tends to be, it's most noticeable on the inhale, and it's not overpowering in the slightest. I found it to be the strongest at lower percentages; it was most present at 0.5% and diminished significantly at higher percentages. It's a nice touch in that it seems to keep the cinnamon from becoming too powerful and overwhelming.\n\nThere isn't a ton to say about the cinnamon. Again, it's artificial cinnamon and not a bakery cinnamon. It's warm and candy-like, and it's got some sweetness that makes it more palatable and keeps the cinnamon from becoming astringent and bitter. The sweet note is most noticeable on the exhale. At higher percentages (for me, anything above 1.5%), things started getting a little uncomfortable. The cinnamon gets *too* warm. 0.5% is where I find the most even distribution of menthol and cinnamon. The menthol gets knocked down a notch or two at 1%. 1.5% is a solid candy cinnamon flavor with the menthol lingering discreetly in the background.\n\n**Mouthfeel:** I was anticipating a very dry, thin flavor, but it really isn't either of those things. The sweetness that's present kind of weighs things down and prevents things from becoming uncomfortably dry. The sweet note makes you feel like you had a cinnamon hard candy in your mouth at some point within the last half hour. This, in addition to the menthol, does a nice job of combating the wispy feeling that's present in similar concentrates. This flavor isn't juicy or heavy by any means, but it's heavier than you'd expect for an artificial, candy cinnamon.\n\n**Off-notes:** This is one of those flavors that you feel just a much as you taste. The combination of menthol and cinnamon sinks down into your lungs, so if you don't like that sensation, I wouldn't recommend this concentrate. Besides that, there isn't anything that's extremely off-putting here.\n\n**Suggested percentages and pairings:** Solo, this was most enjoyable at 1%. I'd stay below 1% in a mix. Unless you're using a low wattage setup, I don't see many scenarios where this would need to be mixed above 1.5%. It'd pair well with mints, and it could work well in boozy beverage profiles. I threw it in with some FA Fuji, and it kind of worked, so apple pairings would be another suggestion.","author":"PepperMyJabrill","title":"Fireball","url":"https://redd.it/eellmo","vendor":{"name":"DuraSmoke","code":"DS"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"DS","title":"Fireball"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
