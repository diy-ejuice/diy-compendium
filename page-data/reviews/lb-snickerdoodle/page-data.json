Shout out to Liquid Barn*\n\n**Setup:** Recoil w/ flavor barrel, Dual 15 wrap 26g 3mm Nifethal 70 coils @.14 ohms.  60w power, 450F temp limit. Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Liquid Barn Snickerdoodle, 5 and 10%  @ 1g/ml, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 34 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Solid cinnamon and sugar cookie with a richer base, missing some texture.\n\nThe cinnamon here seems pretty dead on for a snickerdoodle.  Solid bakery cinnamon without being too intensely dry or having any weird off notes.  Cinnamon level seems like a fit for the profile, fairly prominent in the mix but not overwhelming.  No real body to the cinnamon, tastes just a little thin and can pick up a bit of cinnamon red-hot kind astringency at higher percentages.  The cinnamon is pretty much dominating the top notes here, so it actually comes across a bit like a snickerdoodle would with the cinnamon on top.\n\nThe cookie base here is rich.  I'm not a diketone scientist, but [5,000 ppm of both Acetoin and Acetyl Propionyl](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0307/9897/files/Snickerdoodle_DS.jpg?5513177427726715981) seems pretty intense.  There is a heavier, dense base to the cookie.  There's not a ton of \"butter\" taste to it, but it's definitely a thicker, buttery mouthfeel.  There's a bit of blond sugar cookie taste here, but not much texture to carry it.  I'm not picking up anything crispy or dark here, and a really soft almost fluffy grain.  Less texture than CAP Sugar Cookie, and nowhere near the crispier, darker FA Cookie.\n\nOverall effect almost comes off more like a cinnamon sugar cookie dough just because of that lack of texture and heavier, rich mouthfeel.  Fairly sweet, but nothing obnoxious and a fit for the profile.\n\n**Off-flavors:**At higher percentages cinnamon gets a bit aggressive and candyish.  Very light cookie taste and not much cookie texture.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  There's a decent amount of cinnamon here, so that picks up a moderate bite.  Beyond that cinnamon, flavor is smooth without any real harshness.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 5% I'm getting a fairly mild cinnamon and some richer mouthfeel but not too much in the way of cookie notes.  Feels a bit unsaturated as a solo flavor.\n\nAt 10% the cinnamon is actually a bit overbearing for me and I'm getting a touch of red hots.  Heavy body, but very little cookie texture, and a lighter actual sugar cookie flavor.\n\nLiquid Barn suggests mixing at 10%, that seems a bit intense on the cinnamon and that heavier mouthfeel.  I'd probably be closer to 7% with some additional cookie backup primarily for texture.  Not a super intense flavor but the cinnamon and richness should translate well as an accent around 4%.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This feels like it's basically 4% of CAP Sugar Cookie from being a really nicely fleshed out snickerdoodle.  You could go the FA Cookie route if you want a crispier cinnamon-based cookie.  Or live dangerously, use both.  I'm not your mom.\n\nOutside of just filling out a snickerdoodle, this should be usable as pretty standard bakery cinnamon with some extra DAAP for good measure.  There's a lot of options there like FW Cinnamon Roll, CAP Cinnamon Roll, LB Bakers Touch, and FLV Rich Cinnamon so it's a bit harder to recommend, but it'll do the job.  Use in standard stuff like danishes, coffee cakes, cinnamon rolls, and spiced cake type applications.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Here's the ELR Page.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/20199)  User \"JoJo\" writes: \"8% (SnV - I think Iâ€™m gonna like this. A buttery, slightly spicy cookie flavor. Maybe a bit of caramel. 1 week - same. I can see this and bakers touch going together really well. 2 weeks - same. Buttery, cinnamon cookie. 3 weeks - same. Really tasty. 4 weeks - really nice. Slightly buttery/creamy, cinnamon cookie.)\"  Only two notes on there, the other is substantially postive from user \"Crago44\" writes: \"Think I got a bad batch but I taste nothing but pond water or dirty equipment.  Absolutely unVapeable.\"  That definitely hasn't been my experience.\n\n[User \"Amy2\" has quick reviews up on the ELR Forum. Her take: \"It says cinnamon sugar cookie but I get a heavy cream and cinnamon swirl going on here. It has Acetoin & AP in it.\"][(http://forum.e-liquid-recipes.com/t/liquid-barn-tasting-notes/66705)\n\n[Liquid Barn's product page.
