I don't mean for that to sound bad because it is quite delicious with a tad bit of effervescence. I am not getting just a straight cherry cola like I was so afraid I would. It tastes pretty authentic to the Dr. Pepper, or even better, Mr. Pibb, profile. \n\n**Off-flavors:**  I don't get anything that is not supposed to be there\n\n**Throat Hit:**  It is pretty smooth, nothing like I was expecting.\n\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I would honestly vape this standalone or maybe with some vbic or vanila shisha for a float type mix.\n\n**Notes:**\nI really like this flavor. It has not changed much in the 8 days I let it steep so you could vape it right away with maybe the only difference is a little bit of a throat hit but nothing too harsh. \n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Not much in the way of ELR Notes](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/35802)\nSomeone did comment saying that it tasted more like rootbeer to them.\n\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**\n\nIf you have different opinions on the flavor or any ideas on how to use it please post them in the comments.
