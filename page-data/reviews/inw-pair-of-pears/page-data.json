Obviously it is not a problem when vaping pear flavored juice.\n\nThis is another fruit flavor that in my opinion does not need much steeping. On the first day it smelled just like it smells now, after seven days - little bit sour, fruity, with juice-like sweetness. It reminds me of pear juice, really. No signs of anything artifiicial, no creamy undertones. Just pear.\n\nI started off with 250 Celsius, then went up to 260.\nAt the inhale at 250 Celsius, there's just mild sweetness, and basically no throat hit either with 5 or 2,5% concentration. At 260 I started to pick up a fruity, sour taste, but still no throat hit.\nExhale is pleasant. There's this lightly sweet pear flavour filling my mouth, transforming into sour taste. Throat hit is there, but it's much lighter comparing to Melon.\n\n I don't feel that smoothness that I felt with their Melon aroma, but it does not surprise me as pears are not like that.\n\nI would not compare it to eating a pear, more like drinking pear juice, really. It's good, and I'm using it currently as my daily vape. \n\n\n\n**Uses and pairings:** Personally I think it would go great in fruity mixes as much as it tastes great single. I would pair it (hehe, pair a pair of pears, badum tss) with a sweet apple aroma as this one has a visibly sour thing to it and it's sweetness is not overwhelming. I vaped it with Juicy Lemon flavor and it was a good combination, too. It mixes well in my opinion.\n\n**Personal testing notes:** There's nothing wrong with using 5%, but I think it's a waste of aroma because there really is no much difference between 5 and 2,5% besides intensity of the flavor. I wouldn't go higher than 5% as I think acidity would be too much, and I have to try it more at 5% because most of the time I used 2,5% and want to be sure about best percentage. For now, 2,5% is good for me.\n\n**Second opinions:** None so far, but there will be soon.\n\n**Summary**: Really good and well balanced pear flavor, reminding me of pear juice more than a fruit. Probably mixes well with a lot of fruit flavors and does not need 5% concentration to catch all of it's taste.\nIf it gets released on the market I surely could recommend it to y'all.\n\nquestions/co-op: mrgvape@gmail.com\n\nZni≈ºki na idym.eu/idym.eu discounts: enter YWJJ7KN5 code during checkout","author":"mrgruszka","title":"Pair of Pears","url":"https://redd.it/6sk8r4","vendor":{"name":"Inawera","code":"INW"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"INW","title":"Pair of Pears"}},
