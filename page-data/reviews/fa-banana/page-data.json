Fairly dense for a fruit flavoring 7/10.\n\n**Throat Hit** 2/10\n\n**Flavor Properties**\n\nThis is a complex flavoring with a very light candy aspect to it. Earthy notes that come off savory yet, the flavoring is still very fruity, juicy, with a light sweetness. \n\n**Relatable Flavors** \n\nReminds me of a unripened banana that is not quite there yet, more realistic than other banana flavorings.\n\n**Position In The Recipe** \n\nSurprisingly dense will definitely work as a base note, could also see it being used as a accent help other banana flavorings become more realistic.\n\n**Off Flavors**\n\nThe slight aftertaste, and as stated earlier slightly dull almost chalky.\n\n**Pairings** \n\nBerries, Stone fruits, tropical fruits, chocolate, custard, creams, bakeries, candies, and vanilla flavoring.\n\n**Recipe** \n\n https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/12783\n\n**Notes** \n\nThe flavoring was surprisingly weak for a Flavour art flavoring wish I would have tested it a little higher,  2% seems to work well with other banana flavorings.\n\n**Rating** 75/100\n\n**Please if your opinion differs, or you have another review for this flavor add it in the comments. This will help the master list with multiple reviews in one spot.**","author":"Chrisdvr1","title":"Banana","url":"https://redd.it/51mhtr","vendor":{"name":"Flavour Art","code":"FA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FA","title":"Banana"}},
