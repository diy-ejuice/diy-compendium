It’s got a decent artificial vanilla you’d get in store brand cupcake frosting. Dense mouthfeel and its pretty damn sweet. Above 4% it gets cloying for me but from 2-4% it’s a pretty good frosting flavor. At 4% there is a tiny note of some kind of ‘cake’ but its pretty easy to overlook with all the frosting on top. needs some help to be an actual cupcake. \n\n**Off-flavors**: Get a very slight waxy/plastic taste at 4% but it is covered up in most mixes, at 5% and up I find it unusable. Not much off taste at 2% and below.\nThroat hit: Smooth, almost none.\n\n**Uses**: I’ve used this right at 4% as the frosting for a simple cupcake recipe. Also would use this from 1-2% to boost creams. I could also see this working at 1-2% with fruits, mainly berries. \n\n**Pairings**: Chocolate, cakes and most baked things, most fruits+berries, cereals, caramel, spices, vanilla. \n\n**Notes**: Overall I like this flavor. I bought it to make [Vurve’s Birthday Ice Cream Cake](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/16823#birthday_ice_cream_cake_by_vurve) and it’s used excellently there to boost the cream/cake. If you’re looking for actual cake/cupcake flavor I’d go with JF yellow cake or CAP Vanilla Cupcake v1, or CAP Yellow Cake but I prefer Jungle Flavors version. \n\n**Second Opinions**\nSomeone on ELR mentions [plastic taste above 6%](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/22622) there are some other notes there with mixed reviews.\n\nOne review [on BCF](http://www.bullcityflavors.com/vanilla-cupcake-v2-cap/) that was positive and mentioned some kind of pepper taste that this and V1 shared\n\t\n5 reviews on [this site](http://vapable.com/product/new-vanilla-cupcake-v2-capella-flavour-concentrate/), one 3 star review says “Didn’t like it. Ended up down the sink. Others seem to like it, so went middle vote” .. the rest are very positive. \n","author":"HashSlingingSlashur","title":"Vanilla Cupcake V2","url":"https://redd.it/6078xj","vendor":{"name":"Capella","code":"CAP"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"CAP","title":"Vanilla Cupcake V2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
