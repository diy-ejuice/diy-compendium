Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** HS Watermelon @ 2%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 22 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Roses and watermelon rind.  Not a juicy watermelon, or candy watermelon kind of flavor.\n\nInhale is warm and floral. Tastes like the white border between the pink and green on watermelon.  Exhale has higher rose floral top notes. Green watermelon base.  Sweetness level is sort of subdued, a lot like actual watermelon.  A bit on the dry side, no real juiciness here. Lingering florals, but for first breath you take after the exhale manages to taste more like a watermelon than the actual vape. It's a bit odd.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Roses. The floral note tastes really similar to [HS Honey](https://redd.it/5sgwdc).  Really similar actually. Same wet rose garden type of thing.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Light, mostly from the florals here.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  It's sort of hard to recommend this for much. About the only thing I can think of would be like an aqua-fresca kind of mix where the freshness of that floral rose note might actually work to your benefit.  There may be some niche use in trying to replicate an actual slice of watermelon and really capture that white part of the rind.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nS&V concentration testing, this is definitely best low.  At .25%, you get a decent watermelon rind flavor with a bit of the floral rose. .5% fills that rind out and you get a hint of watermelon flesh. .75% is actually getting a bit weird for me. At 1% and above this starts tasting like cheap shampoo. The rose just dominates, and that green rind gets a bit aloe-y.  I'd mix with this down at .25-.5% to just punch up a melon mix.  It'll do a decent job adding a more realistic rind but that's about it.\n\n\nEh, I'd skip this but I've never really needed more rind in my melon flavors.  Some people seem to like it...\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Post from a couple years ago giving this a 9/10.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/226bzz/my_review_of_hangsen_flavor_concentrates/)\n\n\"This one is a perfect melon flavor. Of course it's artificial/candy watermelon BUT it isn't too overpowering and/or soapy as a result (which requires much steeping). Not to mention, (like ALL of their flavors) a little goes a long way. 9/10\"\n\n[Someone on ECF digs this stuff.](https://www.e-cigarette-forum.com/forum/threads/hangsen-the-best-natural-tasting-watermelon.430903/)\n\nI don't know, there isn't a ton of information but some people out there like this stuff. I just can't get over that rose floral thing, all though I will admit the rind tastes pretty spot-on.\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)** ","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Watermelon","url":"https://redd.it/5tpa13","vendor":{"name":"Hangsen","code":"HS"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"HS","title":"Watermelon"}},
