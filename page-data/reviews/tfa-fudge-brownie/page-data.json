Just a perfectly moist, and creamy fudge brownie.          \n            \n**Off Flavors** - Slightly chalky, and just a little greasy.\n\n**Position in the recipe** - Should be a great top note, and should be able to work it into a base with a few friends at lower percentages. \n\nPretty good Standalone flavor as well.\n\n**Pairings** - Other chocolates, creams, and dark berry flavors or a little vanilla bean ice cream for a fudge brownie a la mode.
