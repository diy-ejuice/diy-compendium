Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Vape Train Chocolate Mousse, 3% and 7%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 14 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Softer, fluffy chocolate flavor.\n\nSolid chocolate here.  Seems more like semi-sweet rather than a darker chocolate or a really rich milk chocolate. Nothing too fruity or weird, and with just a bit of bitterness to set it all off.   Sweet but not cloying, seems pretty well-balanced overall.\n\nThe mousse part this comes across more in mouthfeel than actual taste for me.  This does seem to have a fluffier mouthfeel and texture.  I’m not really picking up anything richer like a mousse.  Comes across a bit more like a chocolate whipped cream like to me, but I’m not getting any strong dairy notes.   Mostly just a fluffy chocolate.\n\nI do pick up a bit of a plastic note out of this.  Still pretty subtle at 7%, and doesn’t really show up that clearly at 3%.  Nowhere near the plastic weirdness of the reformulated INW Milk Chocolate, but seems to be there if you are looking for it.   Would probably stand out a bit more in a tiny rda.  No weird tartness like VTA Devon Cream though.\n\nAnd because it’s a chocolate, a quick note on coil gore.  Relatively light concentrate, with no really extreme gunking.  After about 15mls I’d say my wicks were a bit crispy and the flavor was becoming fairly muted, but no distinct coil gore.  Maybe a hair harder on the wicks that TPA Double Chocolate Clear, but nothing serious.\n\n**Off-Flavors:**  Light “band-aid” type plastic note at higher percentages.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Nah, I’d call it fairly smooth.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 3%, the flavor here seems a bit light.  Clear cocoa notes, but not much fullness.  Middle of the flavor feels a bit watery.  No off-flavors here though.\n\nAt 7%,  fuller chocolate.  Still not picking up much mousse, but the chocolate tastes about like the chocolate in a mousse and the mouthfeel is fluffy without feeling thin.  Light plastic note though.\n\nVape Train suggests mixing with this at 1-2% or standalone from 3-6%.  Sure, that sounds okay.  Just based on these tests, that seems like it’s in the ballpark.  I’d be more likely to use this as a base to build off at around 5-7%, but you’d get a lighter chocolate accent down around 2%.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**    Very soft, kind of diffused chocolate flavor.  Feels a lot like it’s going to sink into recipes as opposed to working like a discrete chocolate component.  Pairing this up against a milkshake base would do a fairly solid chocolate milkshake.  I could also see using this as chocolate in a chocolate cake.\n\nShould pair well with fruit flavors in general, just because the off-notes are pretty manageable.  I’d look mostly at traditional red fruits like strawberries and raspberries, but knock youself out if you really want to pair up something weirder like acai or blueberry. \n\nAlso feels like it could work to put some chocolate in a cheesecake or even a mousse. \n\n**Second Opinions:**  Again, the almighty google is coming up short.\n\n[Here is the product page from Vape Train.
