My hand kept shaking in fear when I tried to go over 20%, so I just gave up.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Equipment Used:**  Troll RDA with a wickless single SS .8 ohm Clapton coil at 20W.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**PG/VG:** 30/70\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Steep Time:** 31 Days\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Aroma:** Bright vanilla, cream, cookie, specifically (insert famous maker here) English Tea cookies.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Flavor Description:** This is a cookie dominant custard with good body. The body isn't coming from the cream, more of the slight dryness wafer type texture of the cookie. It tastes very much like a shortbread or butter cookie, served in a bowl with a smooth vanilla pudding. I can swear I am tasting INW Biscuit in this one, or AP? I wouldn't classify this as a custard as it's missing that heavy dark vanilla, rich cream, and eggs. Which is not a bad thing at all. It's very similiar to instant vanilla pudding made with milk. With a very light back note of coconut. I'm sorry, I'm not describing this well. I think it must be past my bedtime. To be honest, this is such a distinct and developed flavor that it's going to take some creativity to make blends with this one. It will be fun trying though, and it's an excellent ADV single flavor.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:** Coconut\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit:** 3/10\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Pairings:** Pastries, lemon, pineapple, peaches, pears, berries, banana, coffee, cookies, pies, creams, custards, nuts, tobaccos, spices, cinnamon,  nutmeg. Avoid melons. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Notes:** Again, I was afraid of the recommended percentages. I actually think the 20% is a good strength on this one. For my tastes the 30% would be too much. I'm going to stop beating around the bush here. This is a bite of Jello Instant Vanilla Pudding scooped up with a Mother's English Tea Cookie sprinkled with a bit of coconut. \n","author":"mysticrosell","title":"Nice Custard Cream","url":"https://redd.it/5resev","vendor":{"name":"Chef's Flavours","code":"CF"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"CF","title":"Nice Custard Cream"}},
