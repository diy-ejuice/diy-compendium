It’s a pretty complex flavour for an apple. Really authentic, realistic, natural apple. Lovely sweetness, some nice tartness. Has a great amount of juiciness. A little bit of mealy texture. The peel note runs throughout and sits on top of a juicy, apple flesh base. There's a little separation between the peel and flesh, but like it would be if eating an apple. Authentic amount of peel if not used at too high of a %. Overall it's just really a good, really authentic complete apple. \n\nAfter a week it didn’t change.\n\n\nMouthfeel/ Texture: really juicy. Slight mealy texture.\n\nOff Notes: soapy off note at higher %s. \n\nThroat Hit: none. Which is good as I get a mild to moderate throat hit from most apples. \n\n% Testing: 10% is too high as the peel note is soapy. It runs most of the way through the vape so could make it tricky to cover. The peel note is pretty prominent, maybe 60% peel and 40% flesh? \n\nAt 6% I’m not getting the soapy off note. It's full flavoured at 6% and there is a much better balance between the peel and flesh now. Probably around 80% flesh, 20% peel? It's still almost as juicy as it was at 10% and nearly as full flavoured. \n\nMight work better at around 4-5%? I do occasionally get a hint of that soapy note at 6%. It's only a hint and only occasionally though.\n\nUse and Pairings: I could vape it as a SF. I think you could use this wherever you wanted a natural, realistic apple. I might also use this to give another apple a peel note, mealy texture and juiciness. Although it's so good I'd probably want to use this as a main, or only apple. It isn't lacking in anything so could probably use it as the only apple in a mix. Might be good as a background to a fruit mix, but you're likely going know there's apple in there due to the peel. \n\nI don't know how it would fair as a cooked apple. Maybe the addition of FA Liquid Amber could push it in that direction?","author":"-DixxleRoo-","title":"Apple","url":"https://redd.it/hqc6x9","vendor":{"name":"Vaping Swag Originals","code":"VSO"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"VSO","title":"Apple"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
