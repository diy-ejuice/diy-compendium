Flavoring has a very smooth yet sharp mouth feel.\n\n**Throat Hit** 4/10\n\n**Flavor Properties** \n\nSlightly bitter and bright citrus flavoring, fruity and candy like, with just a hint of cream.\n\n**Relatable Flavors** \n\nRemind me of orange runts.\n\n**Position In The Recipe** \n\nMy opinion this flavoring is most useful as an accent, helps bring that little bit of candy too other orange flavors. Along with working some strange Magic on tropical fruits especially mango.\n\n**Off Flavors**\n\nVery light aftertaste, and almost no cream flavor.\n\n**Pairings** \n\nBerries, orange flavorings, tropical fruits, coconut, chocolate, bakeries and vanilla.\n\n**Recipe** \n\nFirst I do not deserve the credit for this recipe the original author worked very hard on making a donut without using a a donut flavoring. And really deserves the credit for that I simply added in some orange because I love orange glazed donuts.\n\n I recently put this on the dod Facebook group and after some feedback realized the icing was not working, the addition of orange cream really marries the icing flavor together with the rest of the recipe. \n\nNow if I can just keep myself from vaping this long enough for it to steep ðŸ¤”\n\n https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/12399#orange_glazed_doughnut_by_chrisdvr1\n\n**Notes** \n\nThis was one of the first flavors I  purchased, was an attempt at an orange creamsicle, the flavor  did not live up to the expectations. \n\nI am glad I didn't throw it out however it has proven to be a very useful flavoring, just goes to show you never know when it flavoring it's going to become useful and a recipe.\n\n**Rating** 70/100\n\n**Please if your opinion differs, or you have another review for this flavor add it in the comments.
