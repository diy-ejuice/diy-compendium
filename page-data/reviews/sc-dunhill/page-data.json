Could sit in an authentic tasting recipe or a dessert tobacco blend.\n- Doesn't have enough going on to be a stand alone for me but if I had nothing else, it's so non-offensive to my taste buds that I wouldn't mind if I had to vape it all day.\n- Overall, it's so middle of the way that it could be a pretty useful flavor for any tobacco head. In the same breath, it's lack of defining features will require artful pairings to really make it pop.\n- PS. It does not taste like a Dunhill cigarette, surprise surprise :P","author":"T_Mace","title":"Dunhill","url":"https://redd.it/6a3kat","vendor":{"name":"Super Concentrated","code":"SC"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"SC","title":"Dunhill"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
