We all know that vodka goes with absolutely anything and when it comes to e-liquid its uses are equally dynamic. Create recipes such vodka and orange, spritzers, watermelon martinis’, candy infused vodka and many more. Pairing vodka works in beverage, fruity, dessert and various other styles of e-liquid making. This is definitely a great flavour to carry in your arsenal if you’re looking for that authentic vodka taste.\" \n\n**NOTES:** Tested on back of hand after mixing it tasted like a fruity cheap vodka. After it steeped for 2 weeks I vaped it. Fruitiness was still there but it was more like a citrus. It definitely smells & tastes like vodka. Not like a top shelf Russian Vodka, or hell not even like a Smirnoff citrus vodka. It's more of very bottom shelf plastic bottle vodka with some citrus in it. I do get kind of a Pinesol like note from, but it is not all that present. It is a decent enough vodka flavor that you can use it for a vodka note in a mix. Just be aware of the citrus note you will have to cover up if you're not going for a citrus vodka cocktail drink \n\n**Pairings:** fruits & cocktails","author":"ebc88","title":"Russian Vodka","url":"https://redd.it/8gbvbe","vendor":{"name":"Vape Train Australia","code":"VTA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"VTA","title":"Russian Vodka"}},
