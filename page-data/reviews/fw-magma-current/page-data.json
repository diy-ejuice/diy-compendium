Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FW Magma Current @ %10, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 7 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  So credit to /u/l33fty/ for pushing this as a cherimoya flavor, because the flavorwest picture thing for this flavor has a bunch of mangoes with some blackberries and strawberries.  I don't know, I'm going to split the difference. I can see how this is a cherimoya flavor, and I can see this as a kind of bad mango and floral blackberry mix.\n\nInhale is fairly thin candy banana with sharper floral berry notes.  Exhale has a banana candy tinged dry mango base.  Higher artificial berry or apple top notes. Moderate density, but again dry as opposed to fluffy. Sort of medium sweet, but with a hollow kind of sweetness you get from diet sodas.  No real juice to this, more like a candy flavor without the level of sweetness you'd expect. Lingering perfumey top notes.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Even at 10% tastes thin and artificial. It has an asparatame kind of edge to it without a heavy sweetness. Not enough juicy body to really carry that flavor without tasting astringent and weird.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Light.  By the time you get a full flavor out of this you have quite a bit of a perfumey edge to deal with.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I'm kind of at a loss. There are multiple good cherimoya flavors out there that are more concentrated and have some actual body, so I'm not seeing much of a use for it.\n\nIf this is indeed some kind of a berry and mango mix, it's not a particularly good one.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nMy first test of this was at 3%, and it was really weak. Light flavor all around.  6% was a bit better, giving a more solid bottom end here, although you start notice that artificial edge on that mango-ish flavor here.  It took going up to 9% to really get a full flavor out of this. 12% is getting too floral and sharp.  If you're bound and determined to use this, maybe start at 10%?\n\nI'm always wondering if I'm missing out on something with the obtusely named flavorwest flavors, but it doesn't really seem like it with this one.  Too weak to be useful at low percentages, and too weird to be useful at high percentages.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[/u/l33fty/ calls it a real cherimoya type flavor on a review of FLV Soursop.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/5ahfyh/flv_soursop/)  [Continues with \"FW Magma Current 15% mic drop\" on the FOTW for Custard Apples.](\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/5n4rli/an_exotic_flavor_of_the_week_the_custard_apple/)\n\n[Not much popping on ELR.
