Moderately dense I would give it a 4 out of 10, whit a very slight throat hit.         \n\n**Flavor Properties**- Light and smooth milk chocolate with just a hint of bitterness. Slightly buttery and semi-sweet.      \n\n**Relatable Flavors** - like eating a handful of semi sweet milk chocolate chips.    \n               \n**Off Flavors** - The usual chalky              chocolate flavor, buy with no a lingering aftertaste like most.\n\n**Position In The Recipe** - Should be a great top note. May also work as an accent for other chocolates.\n\n**Pairings** - Other chocolates, creams, bakeries, dark berry flavors such as strawberry, caramels, and tobacco's.","author":"Chrisdvr1","title":"Milk Chocolate","url":"https://redd.it/4n09je","vendor":{"name":"Inawera","code":"INW"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"INW","title":"Milk Chocolate"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
