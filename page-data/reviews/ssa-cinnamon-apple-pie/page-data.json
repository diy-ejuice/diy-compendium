Plastic, chemical disgusting old plastic, with a little bit of pie crust.   \nNever SnV this in your life, unless you are looking for a reason to kill yourself.\n\n**3 Days steep:** I still want to kill myself.  \nMy day is ruined. Fuck.\n\n**5 Days steep:** Well wadda ya know, there's a bit of apple in here! Pretty juicy apples, like they're boiled for hours in water, cooled down, and drink that apple bath water. \n\n**7 Days steep:** Wet apple, a minute trace of cinnamon and 0 crust. \n\n**Offnotes:** All of them, this is one big offnote. \n\n**Sidenotes:** Just don't, unless you want to vape apple bath water. This flavor is just bad.   \nWhy it's called Cinnamon Apple Pie is beyond me, it's a wet apple.","author":"TBX-12","title":"Cinnamon Apple Pie","url":"https://redd.it/jn9xl9","vendor":{"name":"Sobucky Super Aromas","code":"SSA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"SSA","title":"Cinnamon Apple Pie"}},
