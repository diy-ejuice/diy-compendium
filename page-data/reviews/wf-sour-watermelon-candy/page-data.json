As a vape i got watermelonish/pink candy inhale with an aspartame? exhale. very artificial sugary not very sour. Vapor production i would describe as fluffy without being dense trending on the drier side. Can leave an artificial sugar taste in the back of your throat at higher percentages.\n\n\n**Off-flavors:** Aside from the artificial sugar flavor no off notes\n\n**Throat Hit:** 1/10\n\n**Uses & Pairings:** As a backup to a more full watermelon that you want to candy up a bit?\n\n**Notes:** You've probably noticed the theme of \"artificial sugar\" running through this review. Of the three Wonder Flavors i've tried they're all of the candy variety and all come with a aspartame/saccharin note of varying degrees. i guess this is the sweet and/or sour part of the name? At lower percentages it's not as prevalent but the higher you go the more it shows up and will taper down just a bit after 3 days and holds at that level throughout a week. \n\n\n","author":"Boondoc","title":"Sour Watermelon Candy","url":"https://redd.it/5iv84e","vendor":{"name":"Wonder Flavors","code":"WF"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"WF","title":"Sour Watermelon Candy"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
