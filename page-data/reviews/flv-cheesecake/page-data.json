Nice thick mouth feel, not too much cheesy tartness but enough to let you know you are vaping a cheesecake and not just sweet milk. Complete with a touch of graham cracker crust. \n\n**Off-flavors:**  Very clean flavor with nothing that should not be there.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Smooth as buttah (at least after a steep).\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I am going to be using this in place of cap ny cheesecake or tfa cheesecake (graham crust). You can pair this with your favorite fruit topping or add it to a cream or custard for some rich smoothness. \n\n**Notes:**\nI have been very disappointed with cheesecake flavors. None of them seem very authentic or satisfying to me but this is on point with what I always thought a cheesecake flavor should be. \n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nWhy can't I ever find notes for the flavors I want to review? Argh. Maybe I am just bad at the internet.\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**\n\nIf you have different opinions on the flavor or any ideas on how to use it please post them in the comments.
