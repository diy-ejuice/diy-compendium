It makes me think of if Dark for Pipe had some cherry/fruity sweetness to it. Fairly one-dimensional flavor, but very good.\n\nOff-flavors: None\n\nthroat hit: 3/10\n\nSecond Opinions: none that i could find on here.","author":"[deleted]","title":"Red for Pipe","url":"https://redd.it/6mi9uu","vendor":{"name":"Inawera","code":"INW"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"INW","title":"Red for Pipe"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
