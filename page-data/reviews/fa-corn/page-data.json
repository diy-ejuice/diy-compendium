It's a bit flat if I had to be picky but it's definitely perfect if you wanted to vape corn for whatever reason.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Possible usage?** We already have good buttery concentrates and a few smoky ones, with a bit of trial and error this could fit in a BBQ'd or flame grilled corn on the cob vape.","author":"horrend","title":"Corn","url":"https://redd.it/agc45m","vendor":{"name":"Flavour Art","code":"FA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FA","title":"Corn"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
