Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FW Waffle Cone, 2 and 4%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 12 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  The middle ground between a waffle and a waffle cone.  Hot waffle iron flavor.  The sweetness seems really similar to what I was getting from [FW Funnel Cake](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/6q8mrs/fw_funnel_cake/) and [FW Glazed Donut](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/6qfl8h/fw_glazed_donut/) where I'm not sure it's supposed to be an actual maple flavor, but it has a maple edge to it.  Combining that with the waffle iron flavor, you've got a pretty identifiable waffle as opposed to waffle cone. The body here is a bit unsatisfying. It doesn't feel full enough for an actual waffle but it's not crisp enough for a waffle cone.  Doesn't seem to really crisp up all the way, and instead gets cardboard-y and dry at higher percentages.\n\nInhale is dry and sweet.  Seems a bit fluffy and underflavored for a crispier waffle cone. Plenty of volume, but it's getting pretty cardboard-y.  The sweetness here has that weird maple edge to it. Syrupy as opposed to a dryer powdered sugar type of sweetness. Exhale opens with that softer waffle flavor, with some hot iron waffle and maple in the top notes.  Sweetness comes in pretty heavy after that, getting a little dry and harsh. Waffle flavor, but not body fades out towards the back end of the exhale getting pretty bland.  Lingering dryness and some of that light cast-ironish waffle iron flavor.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Kind of misses the profile for a waffle cone with that maple and the less crisp body.  Body tastes kind of soft and thin instead of crispy, bordering on the dreaded cardboard-y.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light, gets a bit dry and harsh at higher percentages.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I'm not sure you're going to get rid of that light maple here, but you may be able to crisp this up a bit with some additional AP.  I'm not sure it's going to really come across as a cohesive flavor, though.  I've never had a lot of success mashing together a cardboard-y flavor and a crisp note into a single flavor.\n\n**Notes:**  At 2%, this feels pretty unsatisfying overall. Sweet, but undefined. Maybe like smelling some making waffles in the next room.  4% is a bit better, I'm getting more fluffy volume out of this, but it still doesn't have a really crisp texture to it. Maple is getting a bit distracting and prominent. At 6% that waffle iron flavor sticks out a bit more.  It's getting dry, but it's the closest to to crisp as this has tasted to me. 8% is dry, and it's getting really cardboard-y. 10% tastes like maple syrup and cardboard.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nNah, still new.\n\n[Here's the Flavorwest product page.
