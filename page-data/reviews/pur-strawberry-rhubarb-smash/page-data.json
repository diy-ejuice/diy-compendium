    "result": {"data":{"reviewsJson":{"markdown":"**Percentage Used:** 6%\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Equipment Used:**  Troll RDA with a single Kanthal .3 ohm Staircase coil at 27W. 24g kernel with 32g wrap, cotton wick.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**PG/VG:** 30/70\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Steep Time:** 7 Days and 4 Weeks\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Aroma:** Strawberry with a hint of strawberry jam. Slight chemical bitterness. Hint of flour pie crust.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Flavor Description:** Artificial strawberry base with an attempt at rhubarb. It has some similar flavor aspects, but it is missing that sharp tangy tartness. And it has a very noticeable chemical off note. The fruits do blend and balance well without either overpowering the other. It's just a little closer to celery than rhubarb. Not getting crust at this point, and not sweet or sour enough. With the longer steep this has really blended well and matured into a great blend. The strawberry and rhubarb is balanced well, and has turned into a sweet and slightly tart pie filling. The strawberry has lost any artificial taint and is cooked and sweetened. The rhubarb left the celery behind and is a very authentic cooked rhubarb, but is missing that pronounced tartness. On the exhale I'm getting a light flour crust. It's very good, but not strong enough to balance the fruit.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:** Chemical/celery before steep.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit:** 2/10\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Pairings:**  Pies, cake, creams, custards,  jam, peanut butter, cookie, pie crust, graham cracker, ice cream, whipped cream.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Notes:** Relatively moderate strength at 6%. Also a good starting percentage when aiming for a pie. Just needs some help with the pie crust.","author":"mysticrosell","title":"Strawberry Rhubarb Smash","url":"https://redd.it/6dkot1","vendor":{"name":"Purilum","code":"PUR"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"PUR","title":"Strawberry Rhubarb Smash"}},
