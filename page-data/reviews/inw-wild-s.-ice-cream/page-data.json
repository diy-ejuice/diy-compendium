The ice-creamy flavors rarely smell like actual ice cream, but on a side not - if you had ice cream in a container and didn't know what it was, you wouldn't know it's ice cream by the smell, right? :D\n\nIt smells like white grapes and wild strawberries with a citrus-like twist. But the grapes in this juice are more like a kinda sweeter grape juice, not actual fruit. The strawberry tones are more of a freshly cut strawberries. It's really pleasant!\n\nAs for the throat hit, with shake&vape it's actually pretty hard. After a few days it becomes lighter, but is still there and I can feel it. As I stated in my other reviews - I like the harshness. :)\n\nThe taste is, for me, great. It's weird, but it's hard to decide what I can feel the most. Grapes or strawberries? It feels like a mix of the two. It leaves a slightly sour taste on my tounge, and tastes more like sweet and sour strawberries than grapes. A question for you, guys - do you know these powder candies, or lollipops that you dip in a fruity powder and lick 'em? I used to eat them all the time as a kid. The taste reminds me of that powder also. I can taste a little bit of orange in there, also.\nThe juice is not too sweet, I actually don't taste anything \"chemical\" like i.e in some watermelon juice,  where you can tell just by smelling it that it's pure chemistry.\nAs for the \"ice cream part\", there's a slight, teeenie tiny bit of coolness in mouth after vaping, but barely noticeable.\n\n**Uses and pairings:**I would go solo with this. Maybe add a little bit of something like vanila to create actual ice cream flavor.\n\n**Personal testing notes**: 2% is alright, no need to go higher. Steep a little before vaping, it gets slightly better overtime.\n\n**Summary:** I don't know if it's in sales internationally yet, but when it will be, try it! It's a nice, light taste that will suit most of fruity juice lovers. Tastes not much different on generic kangertech coils and custom made alien coil in Kayfun v5, which is a flavor chasing tank.\n\n\n**Questions**: DM @unodosvape on instagram or mrgvape@gmail.com","author":"mrgruszka","title":"Wild S.
