It brings a good body to a cream base without being too heavy or overwhelmingly \"dairy\" while still giving a pleasant creamy smoothness. It does offer a very slight sweetness, and really helps harmonize flavors.  \n\nA lot of people claimed they sensed a sort of \"spice\" to it, which I didn't detect in any of my mixes. After trying it as a standalone though, there is definitely a bit of spice to it. IDK Why but I went for it at 3.5%, and I get almost like an horchata flavor from it, which I find very interesting. In mixes at .5-1% I don't detect the spice.\n\n**On the Nose**  \nHeavy cream, slight dairy note, light sweetness and/or spice  \n\n**Usage**  \n*Stand alone*: 2.5-3%. Actually not bad by itself, reminds me of like a spiced milk or dairy version of horchata.  \n\n*In a mix*: .5-1.5% Depending on how prevalent you want the cream; 1% is the sweet spot for me\n\n**Throat**  \nMild.  \n\n**Pairings**  \nOther creams, pretty much every fruit except maybe cherry? Caramel, Butterscotch, Coffee, bakeries, damn near everything.  \n\n**Avoid**  \nOnly thing I can think of is like candies or tobaccos since it will change the profile.  \n\n**Steep**  \n1-2 days.\n\n**Quick Recipe: Melon Mix**  \n*Ratio: 10PG/90VG*  \n*Steep: 3+ days*  \n\n* FLV Wild Melon @ 1.5%  \n* FLV Cantaloupe @ 0.75%  \n* TFA Marshmallow @ 1%  \n* FLV Cream @ 1%  \n\nSo this isn't necessarily my favorite application of this flavor, but you can get a good idea of what it's doing to the mix with this recipe. What it really does here is harmonize the melons, bring that creamy body you're looking for with cream-style flavorings, and tame some of the throat you get from the melons.  \n\n**Bonus Recipe: Sweet Strawberry Cream**  \n*Ratio: 20PG/80VG*  \n*Steep: 3+ days*  \n\n* TFA Strawberry Ripe @ 3%  \n* FA Red Touch @ 0.5%  \n* INW Shisha Strawberry @ 2%  \n* TFA Vanilla Bean Ice Cream @ 3%  \n* INW Shisha Vanilla @ 1%  \n* LA Cream Cheese Icing @ 1%  \n* FLV Cream @ 1%  \n\nThis is where I fell in love with this flavoring =) Although you get a nice bit of creaminess and body from the other non-strawberry flavorings, FLV Cream harmonizes them all together in to a fantastic, well-rounded cream. It tames the VBIC and CCI, adds some depth to them, and blends the vanillas in to the cream base. \n\n","author":"CheebaSteeba","title":"Cream","url":"https://redd.it/4o6a9j","vendor":{"name":"Flavorah","code":"FLV"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FLV","title":"Cream"}},
