Not much in the way of spice, but something in the background. There's that all-too-familiar SC/FE Chocolate note. Idk what they use for tobacco, but they must keep their candy in the same pouch as their tobaccos or something. I can't deny that I already like it though. Fuck if I'm becoming a dessert tobacco loser, though. Grow some balls, SC. That said, this first taste is actually kinda tasty. It's sweet and not actually chocolate. It must be whatever they use to produce a muskiness but in this one, so far, it's producing a fairly tasty sweet mild tobacco flavor. Already, Im thinking this is the dessert tobacco lover's dream. I could see pairing this one particularly with the heavy AP HS tobaccos, but I haven't dug into the other SC/FE ones that were super AP ish off the nose yet. I bet this will be the SC/FE equivalent of FLV Sweet Cigarette for when I want a nondescript sweetness without adding too much potential for conflict like with Sweet Cigarette.\n\nAfter 4 days, this one has already kinda grown on me. Whatever is that chocolate note has faded and I can't detect it at all. It's still sweet mild tobacco note, not very prominent, still kinda leaning more like a soft AP than anything really shaggy, rolled, golden or otherwise. What is kind of nice about it is the really subtle spice melange. \n\nAfter 7 days, not much more has really changed here. I still like this flavor much more than I woulda thought. It's still pretty 'light' on the tobacco, the faint spice note is reminiscent of something pastry like more so than a spiced or sharp tobacco accent. It's got a real soft hint of nuttiness that I wonder if it would be more prominent DTL. \n\n*Suggested percent:* 3-4 main note, at least 2% for an accent although I really dont see that working out too well for this one; it just lacks the Oomph to pull it off.\n\n*Pairing ideas:* I would most likely want to play into that nutty note and use this for a lightly spiced golden tobacco or as above for a sweet spiced tobacco blend. It's very unidentifiable and I could see this getting lost easily in a mix if one were to layer in other baccos. Maybe some combination of this and flv Virginia would make a really nice light simple blend? Something like \n\n - SC Turkish 4\n - FLV VA 1.5\n\nAdd a drop of Arabian at 0.1-2% and I'd probably have all the spice I needed.  and then you can just play: Add 1% KY for some ashy body or 1% Native for a rollie vibe. Alternatively, 0.5 Red Burley for some nuttiness and 0.5-1% Cured for some body and this is a done deal. While fairly basic seeming, I can see this bending more than a few flavors into a variant worthy of their own timelines, and being a general nice addition to the tobacco mixer's toolkit.\n\n**Second Opinions**: \nELR user Kinnikinnick writes:\nThis tobacco has a slightly herbal and slightly spicy quality with a very gentle cane mint note. I find this tobacco flavor more along the lines of what a true Turkish tobacco should actually taste like in reality.  \n  \nMixed at 5%, 40p/60v; will probably hang around the 3 to 5% range when making it the primary tobacco in the mix.  \n  \nPreferred single flavor mix: 4.0%\n\nHmmmm... no real 'mint' note for me, but I can see what this person is saying. There's a bit of 'bite' to it that is a little hard to describe. It's like the tiniest pinch of throat hit and it's noticeable but not nearly distracting or particularly minty, it just does a little of that sharpness that a mint can do in the throat to me.","author":"isuamadog","title":"Turkish","url":"https://redd.it/r7xgly","vendor":{"name":"Super Concentrated","code":"SC"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"SC","title":"Turkish"}},
