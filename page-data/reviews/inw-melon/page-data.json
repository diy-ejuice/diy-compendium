Definitely tastes the most like a [canary melon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canary_melon) than any other type of melon that comes to mind. No rind to speak of and is quite juicy on the inhale and exhale.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Not much at 1%; however, I plan on upping the percentage to 2% to see if this changed. Can be a bit cloying/candy-like if dripped too heavily/vaped for an extended period.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Minuscule throat hit, but could be due to lack of steeping. \n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I would be happy to vape this as a single flavor in the 1-2% range if dripping. Might need to up the percentage a tad if using a tank (maybe 2.5%), but the sweetness might also increase. \n\nAs far as pairings go, subbing/adding this into melon mixes could help add juiciness as well as a bit of sweetness to drier/rind-ish tasting melon flavors. From personal experience, it goes very well with FA Kiwi and INW Cactus (shameless personal recipe plug, [\"Mellow Kiwi\"](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/recipe/1128162/Mellow%20Kiwi)). \n\n**Notes:**\n\nS&V concentration testing: \n\n*  1% is an extremely enjoyable lighter canary melon flavor when dripped. A bit airy, but very low sweetness/candy.\n\n* 2% is sweet, with almost no rind to speak of. Full on canary melon flesh when dripped. Pleasantly juicy as well. This would be my choice as a stand alone percentage.\n\n* 3% smell becomes pretty intense and has a slight sharp peppery note to it (kind of off putting in other words). Taste is candy-like and almost overly ripe. Honey dew is definitely coming through and the flavor seems a bit heavy. Still no throat hit and I wouldn't mind this as a stand alone at all if using a tank. Definitely a bit too sweet to vape for too long on my RDA.\n \n**Second Opinions:**\nPrevious Review by u/chrisdvr1 - https://redd.it/4q57vh\n\n[Singing the praises on this one.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/4sieji/melon_inw_holy_crap/)\n\n[u/JohnLaCuenta believes it to be a honeydew forward type of melon.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/43f8ev/your_favorite_inw_flavors/)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"vape_account","title":"Melon","url":"https://redd.it/5pzgif","vendor":{"name":"Inawera","code":"INW"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"INW","title":"Melon"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
