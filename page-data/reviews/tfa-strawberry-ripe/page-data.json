Slight throat hit and light on the tongue. Not very dense I give it 3 out of 10.           \n\n**Flavor Properties**- This is a much more realistic representation of the sweet and tart strawberry with just a hint of the candy flavor.\n\n**Relatable Flavors** - Like eating a perfectly ripe strawberry with just a little powdered sugar on it.\n\n**Position In The Recipe** - This will work well as a top note or accent. I think that has too much strawberry kick to work as a base.          \n                        \n**Pairings** - This flavoring is other strawberries best friend my preferred strawberry blend is a 2:1 strawberry ripe TFA and strawberry TFA. Just a touch of dragon fruit really makes this flavor pop.\nThat said should work well with all berries, creams, and great when paired with bakeries. For an adventure and odd flavor combinations try it with floral flavorings such as shisha Rosemary or zen garden\n\n**Conclusion** - I'll let you make your own.\n\nSpecial thanks to /u/Vurve  and /u/Matthewkocanda from the beginners blending podcast / modest Monday posts and a shout out to /u/thecathimself for his work with zen garden you've opened up the floodgates!!","author":"Chrisdvr1","title":"Strawberry Ripe","url":"https://redd.it/4m2t12","vendor":{"name":"The Flavor Apprentice","code":"TFA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"TFA","title":"Strawberry Ripe"}},
