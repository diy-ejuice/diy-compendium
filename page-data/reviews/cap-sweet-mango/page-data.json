Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** CAP Sweet Mango @ 4%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 18 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  So, seriously check the second opinions here.  Sweet, perfumey inhale. Really heavy overripe mango on the exhale.  Overripe to the point where I'm almost getting a diacetyl style movie-theater butter note. Light perfumey note sits over the top of the rest of the flavor through the exhale. Thick and sweet.  I'd hesitate to call it creamy.  It's more just dense almost chewy.  Lingering perfume note.\nLight Peel notes, especially on the beginning of the exhale. \n\n**Off-flavors:**  This is super overripe at 4%. I'm definitely getting a buttery flavor.\n\n**Throat Hit:** 3/10.  Those perfumey notes can get a bit harsh solo.  Also a tiny bit of chest tightness that builds with prolonged use.\n\n**Uses:** Lower percentages to flesh out mango and other tropical fruits. Maybe a bit too fleshy for something like mango nectar. Buttery notes might pair well with creams, again at a lower percentage to avoid some of those overripe notes.\n\n**Pairings:** FLV Mango, FA Mango, TFA Mango. Astringent pineapple like TFA.  Dryer bright fruits. Creams and custards.\n\n**Notes:**  So, percentage is key here.  I'd keep this under 2% and avoid this as a main flavor.  This gets super weird super fast.  S&V tested from .05 to 6%. The sweetness is hard to manage, along with that overripe flavor.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nThis one is pretty well documented, and I'm much more negative on it than everyone else.  Like a lot more.  It's primarily used for as a complement mango for sharper flavors and other tropical nonsense.\n\nHonestly, the only real second opinions you need are in a couple FOTW Posts:\n\n[FOTW Mango I](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/37xd26/flavor_of_the_week_mango/)\n\n[FOTW Mango II](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/54q29w/fotw_is_back_this_weeks_flavor_of_the_week_is/)\n\nAll of your answers on how to use this concentrate and damn near any other mango you'd want to use are in there.\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Sweet Mango","url":"https://redd.it/5evnjd","vendor":{"name":"Capella","code":"CAP"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"CAP","title":"Sweet Mango"}},
