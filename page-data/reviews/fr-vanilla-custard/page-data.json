Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Flavor Revolution Vanilla Custard, 1% and 3%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 36 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Heavy Vanilla, light sour custard.\n\nVery aggressive vanilla.  Feels a bit bright for a custard, lacking some of the darker spicier notes from a vanilla bean type flavor.  Vanilla here is kind of a bully, pushing around the lighter custard notes. I do get just a bit of eggyness but not much buttery richness.  Butryic kind of milky taste hiding in the background.\n\n[Flavor Revolution's straight Custard](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/7xcujp/flavor_revolution_custard/) is pretty much swamped by an abundance of butyric acid.  It doesn't seem as severe here due to the really prominent vanilla, but this has some of the same kind of sourness going on.  Again, with a month-long steep most of the more aggressive, vomity parts have pretty much steeped out, but there is still a tart sourness to the base of this.  I get the sourness the most on the inhale, the ehxale is heavy on vanilla that it covers up the worst of it.  The vanilla here covers a lot of sins, and in general this is much more pleasant to vape than the straight custard.\n\nThicker mouthfeel without too much buttery richness.  With the sour, milky notes feels more like a pudding mouthfeel rather than a custard.  That vanilla gets a bit dry for me with extended vaping.  There's a heavy sweetness to this, along with all that vanilla.\n\n**Off-Flavors:**  Sour tart note, feels like a milk base instead of a cream.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Nah, not really.  Some slight dryness to the vanilla, but nothing major.\n\n**Percentage testing:** At 1%, this mostly feels like a strong vanilla with a little bit of a tangy dairy.  Not much richness or depth but nothing too sour.\n\nAt 3% the vanilla here is pretty intense. Strong vanilla, and that tanginess feels a bit sour.  Still no real custard depth, but a sort of full, dry, mouthfeel.\n\nJust based on these tests, I'd probably be around the suggested 2% with this.  Probably the best \ncompromise on flavor and sourness.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Decent option for a relatively rich vanilla pudding base with a lengthy steep, especially if you've got a more realistic fruit in there to soak up some that tartness.\n\nMore vanilla forward DAAP free custard option than normal FA Custard.\n\nShould work pretty well with a yogurt base and some cooling to make a frozen yogurt.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  I'm not finding a lot of documentation out there.\n\n[Here's the product page from Nicotine River.
