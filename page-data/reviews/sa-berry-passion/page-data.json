A bit bitter and Sour. Passionfruit part is not \"jammy\" or ultra perfumy and it feels/tastes like passionfruit juice it also has a candied vibe but on the natural side.\nPerfectly balanced flavor overall.\nYou can throw this in your order blindfolded just like TFA Strawberry Ripe.\nBit too sour (like the real blueberries :D) but super sweet (or other fruits) handle that and it turns into the perfect flavor bomb!\nIce part feels like WS-23.\nFormulation of it is perfect and it really amazed me.\n\nLike i said, It can be improved even more with a bit of super sweet, marshmallow, pear.\n\nreferences for modern DTL/mtl:\n%1.5 adds slight undernote of the overall flavor to the mix.\n%2.5 flavor is noticably upfront but still not punchy enough.\n%3 for using as a cherry on the top..\n%4 flavor is on right at the middle part,,z\n%5 for making this the dominant flavor,\n%6.5 single flavor mixing percentage.\n\nreferences for pods or extra low surface area coils:\n%2 adds slight undertone of the flavor to the mix.\n%4 flavor is noticably upfront but not really enough to make the star of the mix. thin\n%6 still weak for a single flavor mix but it can be one of the stars of the mix.\n%8 this will punch through all the fruits/elements of the mix.\n%10 single flavor mixing ratio perfectly full as a single flavor at this level.\n\n\nHere is a recipe of mine:\nhttps://alltheflavors.com/recipes/247291","author":"romngenie","title":"Berry Passion","url":"https://redd.it/qsxfds","vendor":{"name":"Solub Arome","code":"SA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"SA","title":"Berry Passion"}},
