Depending on the atomizer/setup it can be either a more candy flavour or a fruity/juicy one.\n\nOn Wotofo Profile RDA it felt tangy, sweet (5/10), slightly acidic (4/10) and slightly juicy (5/10). Flavour during inhale and exhale. Very nice and rounded. Probably on the soft side - at 6% and it can take more even. Almost no harshness at all.\n\nOn Guardian (as expected) the flavour is less intense but still present nevertheless. Slightly more tangy, with fresh, slightly bitter citrus notes here, less sweetness and less juicy-ness. More of a zest and less than the flesh/juice part of the fruit.\n\n**Off-flavors:** None that I could spot.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Pretty low at this percentage (3/10).\n\n**Uses:** It is nice standalone for a break from complex flavours and in order to clean the taste buds but I can't imagine vaping this all day. It is probably a very good part of a more rounded recipe including some ingredients with which it will contrast and blend nicely.\n\n**Pairings:** Of course it would pair nice with creams, bakery and other citrus fruits. Could be interesting with a tobacco and maybe with some booze (rum, whiskey, bourbon). Also it would be interesting with some floral notes. Given this is on the sweet side I believe it would not be good to pair it with something also sweet (strawberries, melon, etc) unless you have a sweet tooth...\n\n**Notes:** I have come to really like citrus notes. So far everything I have tried with citrus I love it or can imagine pairing it with something else.\n\n**Rating:** 4.5/5 stars","author":"demisone","title":"Sweet Tangerine","url":"https://redd.it/aldt3m","vendor":{"name":"Capella","code":"CAP"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"CAP","title":"Sweet Tangerine"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
