Somewhat moist and dense with a light vanilla finish. Captures some of the icing feel but this is mostly a very nice cake. Reminds me of a cake right from the box like betty crocker with the matching betty crocker icing. Sweet, not too sweet and its got that artificial vanilla vibe with just the lightest touch of butter. \n\n**Off-flavors**:  Nothing. \n\n**Throat Hit**:  minimal to none\n\n**Uses**:  Not as concentrated as JF yellow cake, I just got CAP yellow cake in and will be reviewing that soon. I think you could use this as a 1:1 sub for FW yellow cake, I used this for Mansons Strawberry Shortcake bar and it turned out great. Anywhere you would use a yellow cake flavor as an accent or a base note. This is a very nice standalone cake flavor.\n\n**Pairings**:  Creams, custards, fruits, chocolates, butter, butterscotch, other cakes and bakery stuff, nuts, caramel (+RY4), cinnamon and other spices, spirits might work to make rum cakes and things like that. This would do well to moisten some dryer ingredients like FA cookie or INW biscuit or things like FA hazelnut. \n\n**Notes** haven’t tried it yet but I think this would be even better as a standalone around 6 or 7%. This is a really great flavoring and so far I prefer it to JF yellow cake on its own. JF is more convenient to get though and you need to use less of it so there’s that.\n\n**Second Opinions**\n\nOnly found one recipe using this on ELR and no I have not mixed it up, not much else out there about this one.\n\nhttp://e-liquid-recipes.com/recipe/588321/Almond%20Cookie \n\n","author":"HashSlingingSlashur","title":"Angel Food Cake","url":"https://redd.it/5pyvrv","vendor":{"name":"DIY Flavor Shack","code":"DIYFS"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"DIYFS","title":"Angel Food Cake"}},
