Pleasant sweet cocoa flavor with a hazelnut finish. Could be more dense/creamy but there’s some creaminess. The inhale is like popping open a bottle of nutella. \n\n**Off-flavors:**  Nothing. Could be a little more chocolaty. \n\n**Throat Hit:**  Not much (1/10)\n\n**Uses:**  Whatever you put Nutella on. I think this could be a nice standalone at like 6-8%. Maybe add marshmallow or a cream. At 5% here it could be a nice nutella/cocoa/nutty base, I don’t think this flavor is very strong so I am not sure how I would use it at lower % yet.\n\n**Pairings:**  Nutella goes with whatever you want it to go with.\n\n**Notes:** Tasty stuff, definetly the best flavor that I’ve tried from DIYFS aside from Holy Vanilla.\n\nIts brown, super brown, definitely going to gunk as much as any chocolate would.\n\n**Second Opinions**\n\nReally there’s nothing out there, no reivews on DIYFS site and couldn’t find this on ELR.\n\nI’d give this an A- because there’s no off flavors and does a good job of quenching my chocolate fix. Tastier than TPA double chocolate clear, and I have no comment on INW Milk Chocolate because I’ve yet to find an application which it works for me.\n \n","author":"HashSlingingSlashur","title":"Nutella","url":"https://redd.it/5p6f96","vendor":{"name":"DIY Flavor Shack","code":"DIYFS"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"DIYFS","title":"Nutella"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
