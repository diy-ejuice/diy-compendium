    "result": {"data":{"reviewsJson":{"markdown":"**Percentage Used:** 7%\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Equipment Used:**  Troll RDA with a wickless single SS .8 ohm Clapton wrapped parallel with 26g SS at 19W.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**PG/VG:** 30/70\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Steep Time:** 19 Days\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Aroma:** Medium strength, warm cream, caramel, vanilla.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Flavor Description:**  At a 19 day steep, the flavor is almost non-existent to me. There is a very slight hint of slightly caramelized vanilla if you really concentrate. It seems more milky rather than creamy, and is missing the richness usually found in Bavarian Creams. I will have to give it a longer steep and/or try a much higher percentage. At 19 days though it seems it should be at least a little creamy and flavorful, but it's possible this flavor requires a longer steep to fully develop.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:** None\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit:** 1/10\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Uses and Pairings:** Desserts, bakeries, and custards. Any fruits other than citrus. Vanilla, caramel, butterscotch, cookie, chocolate, coffee, irish cream, other creams.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Notes:** Compared to LA, TFA, and FW: PUR is about 1/4 the strength. Lacking flavor, creaminess and vanilla for me.\n","author":"mysticrosell","title":"Bavarian Cream","url":"https://redd.it/5mwo75","vendor":{"name":"Purilum","code":"PUR"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"PUR","title":"Bavarian Cream"}},
