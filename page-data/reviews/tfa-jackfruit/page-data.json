I tested this at 5%. It's got an exotic flavor to it; almost reminds me of something you might find in the same family as a cherimoya, or a more exotic melon like papaya. The flavor is a little light, but it is very smooth and has a nice little bit of sweetness to it, so I imagine this will be good for mixes to add a bit of a tropical or exotic element. \n\n**On the Nose**  \nPineapple juice, sweet, candy.  \n\n**Usage**  \n*Stand alone*: 5%. Fairly boring by itself, but not bad. I don't think I'd want to bring it higher than this, seems like it might start to get funky.  \n\n*In a mix*: 1-4%  \n\n**Throat**  \nMild.  \n\n**Pairings**  \nPineapple, apple, pear, cherry, creams, melons, dragonfruit, stonefruits, exotic fruits.  \n\n**Avoid**  \nCoffee, Caramel, Butterscotch.  \n\n**Steep**  \n1-2 days.\n\n**Recipe Ideas**  \nI could see this doing really well in like a Rabri, pi√±a colada, fruit smoothie, things like that.\n","author":"CheebaSteeba","title":"Jackfruit","url":"https://redd.it/4o66uk","vendor":{"name":"The Flavor Apprentice","code":"TFA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"TFA","title":"Jackfruit"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
