It seems like it's dry as well, I'm certainly not getting any dreamy cream. The play doh is overwhelming and is really getting in my way of even describing the nuances. The only time I have ever gotten that play doh is with doughnut flavorings. So I'm assuming some is in there for body and/or sweetness? Or it could be way too much AP? I've never used so much AP that I've gotten the doh taste so I'm not sure if that is a possibility? I could smell slight play doh when scenting the concentrate itself, but it disappeared with the steep. Please add some input in the comments on this one if you've tried it,  especially from those that have either bad or good experiences with donut flavors.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:** Play Doh\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit:** 3/10\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Pairings:** Creams? Juicy fruits? I'm a little lost on this one, I'm sorry.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Notes:** If you are sensitive to doughnut flavoring like I am, this is one you'll want to avoid. I'm not going to try any lower percentages as I know I will just get the same thing, just maybe weaker.\n\n&nbsp;","author":"mysticrosell","title":"Cream Dream","url":"https://redd.it/5rtq7u","vendor":{"name":"Purilum","code":"PUR"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"PUR","title":"Cream Dream"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
