    "result": {"data":{"reviewsJson":{"markdown":"**Setup:** Plume Veil RDA; dual parallel @ .35Î©; cotton wicks; 45W\n\n**Testing:** FA Pear @ 3%; Aged: 3 days\n\n**Flavor description:**  Juicy, bright, crisp, sweet, authentic pear taste.  Very refreshing.  Not tart or bitter.  Leaves a lingering sweetness on the tongue.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  None\n\n**Throat hit:** 2/10 very smooth \n\n**Uses:**  Great mid or top note, I have also heard of this used in place of sweetener or as an accent to tropical fruits or strawberry at lower percentages. \n\n**Pairings:** Use with a small amount of TFA Pear to provide earthiness and create a well-rounded pear flavor.  Also works well with almost any fruits in a mix.  Holds up well with creams as well.\n\n**Notes:**   If you're after an authentic pear flavor, this is a must have. \n\nEDIT: [Link to all of our flavor reviews in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)","author":"wh1skeyk1ng","title":"Pear","url":"https://redd.it/4qcmic","vendor":{"name":"Flavour Art","code":"FA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FA","title":"Pear"}},
