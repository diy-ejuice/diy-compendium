I understand why they didn't label this a green apple jolly rancher, it's mostly a green taste. On the inhale you get mostly a green, vague impression of what might be a green apple under a chemical astringent taste. It's almost like the first taste of a green apple jolly rancher for the first .5 seconds you put it in your mouth and the waxyish taste goes away. On exhale you get an unexpected caramel note. Overall this flavor is very saccharine, i wouldn't go so far as to call it cloying but medium artificial sugary note that's kind of off putting for what it's intended use should be.\n\n\n**Off-flavors:** Chemically artificial sugar flavor with an unexpected caramel on exhale\n\n**Throat Hit:** 5/10\n\n**Uses & Pairings:** Maybe bolster with a more authentic green apple? inw antone/fw green apple with a dash of fuji and a slash of caramel to bring out the off note more?\n\n**Notes:** Again with the artificial sugar flavor from Wonder Flavors. it really tastes less like a green apple jolly rancher and more like one of [these](http://i.imgur.com/2NoI8Qe.jpg). After about a week the caramel fades more into the background but really that just leaves the chemical green flavor a bit more prominent. The throat hit is real on this one. Even at a week in i could feel it and i'm **not** particularly sensitive to throat hit.\n\ne: missing words","author":"Boondoc","title":"Green Jolly Candy","url":"https://redd.it/5iv6ba","vendor":{"name":"Wonder Flavors","code":"WF"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"WF","title":"Green Jolly Candy"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
