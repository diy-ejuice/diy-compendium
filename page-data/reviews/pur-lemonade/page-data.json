Flavor is a very authentic packaged lemonade like Country Time. Which is not a bad thing, it's very good. Not a fresh squeezed lemonade. I also get hints of sour lemon candy with this. Which I also like, vaping it physically makes my mouth water. Surprisingly it's not acidic at all, no rough throat hit that is so common with citrus. At least not with short vaping time. Will have to see what happens with longer vaping.\n\nAt 4 weeks the lemon has unexpectedly hung in there and not faded as badly as they usually do. The tartness is still there, but it has mellowed just a bit. The sour lemon candy aspect is gone and it's straight lemonade now. It's still mouthwatering and very good. However if you like a more tart/sour lemonade that you can almost feel in your jaw, or a sour lemon candy, I would only make enough for a week or 2 at a time. If you like a more mellow version, it's good in 3-4 weeks. I don't know if I would push it passed that simply because lemons usually disappear with extended steeps.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:** None\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit:** 2/10\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Pairings:** Almost any fruit, especially berries. Cookies, cakes, creams, custards, teas, frosting, candy.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Notes:** I can see this being a summertime favorite for me, and can see it being versatile with any fruits. Also good for a sour candy. Although moderately flavored at 4%, for my personal tastes I will like more in the 6-7% range.\n","author":"mysticrosell","title":"Lemonade","url":"https://redd.it/62rjgc","vendor":{"name":"Purilum","code":"PUR"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"PUR","title":"Lemonade"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
