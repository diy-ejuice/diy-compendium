Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FA Cinnamon Ceylon @ .25% and %1, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 28 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Just the spice note from cinnamon. Nothing else really going on except for that spicy cinnamon note.  It's a really thin or narrow warming flavor, over a super neutral base.  Mostly top notes with some really subtle actual cinnamon stick body.  Even at higher percentage I can taste the VG underneath that cinnamon spice.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Cinnamon flavors tend to have a bit of a sour-tasting base underneath and this does as well. It's pretty subtle all things considered and shouldn't be a problem in a mix.  Other people report a savory curry note here.  I'm not picking up on that so much as I'm just associating that with the actual taste of powdered cinnamon.\n\n**Throat Hit:** A bit, but it's cinnamon.  Even better, it just's the part of cinnamon that gives you a throat hit. Taking that into account, not really.  Nothing weird you wouldn't expect.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  [FLV Rich Cinnamon is a thing, and it's pretty great.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/4p3d3a/flv_rich_cinnamon/)  My usage for FA Cinnamon Ceylon is basically wherever that won't fit.  Use this where you don't want a full, richer, slightly powdery cinnamon flavor.\n\nGood accent flavor especially for cinnamon candy recipes. It gives you a cinnamon spice without a ton of body, letting the other ingredients really carry the structure of the vape while just giving you a hit of warm spice.\n\nStrips away enough of the body of cinnamon that it almost tastes pre-mulled, like a liquid that has had a cinnamon stick simmered in it for a pretty solid length of time. Useful in cocktails or beverage vapes, just leaving you with a kick of cinnamon warmth and not too much else.\n\nIn terms of fruit pairings, I'd use this precisely where cinnamon won't fit like with brighter fruits and citruses. It won't dominate a mix like rich cinnamon in those applications.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nThis stuff is a little weaker than you'd think, or at least the flavor here plays on a really specific level and it doesn't really blow out the rest of the vape. S&V concentration testing, this is noticeable but light down at 1 drop per 10ml.  All of the limited cinnamon body shows up down low and doesn't really scale with the spice note. Increasing the percentage really just bumps the spice up. 1% is still not \"spicy\" to me. It sounds bizzare but honestly I'm fine with this up to about 3%. It gets fairly aggressive up that high and it has a tendency to mute other flavors, but it's still a really narrow flavor, just giving you those top notes.  For the masochists, you can take this crazy high and It never crosses into a full bakery cinnamon although it can get a bit dry and it'll raise hell with the other flavors in the mix. As the spice increases it actually moves away from the relative fullness you get down low.  Moreso than most, this is definitely a \"to taste\" kind of flavor based on what you're trying to achieve for a recipe.  I'd probably start at .25% and work up from there.  I seem to be a lot less sensitive to this stuff than other people, so YMMV.\n\nFLV Rich Cinnamon is undoubtedly a better flavor, but this stuff is perhaps a bit more flexible. Better for applications that aren't necessarily all about the cinnamon and it's only acting as a warm spice note to complement the rest of a recipe.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[So the HIC Notes kind of miss the mark with FLV Rich Cinnamon on the market. I'd actually suggest this as your candy cinnamon and Rich Cinnamon as your bakery cinnamon.](http://mamajsflavorshop.com/headinclouds-my-notes-on-flavor-descriptions/)\n\n\"This is superb bakery cinnamon flavor, more complex and true to the real spice than any other cinnamon flavoring. Although some people use it at crazy percentages for red-hot cinnamon candy - that's not the best use of this one. In recipes with bakery-type cinnamon as a major flavor, FlavourArt is perfection - no others can match it. Like real cinnamon powder, this is not a very sweet flavor. It relies on the rest of your recipe for sweetness. Spiced apple pie, cookie flavors with cinnamon, spiced beverages, sweet bakery recipes - that's where Cinnamon Ceylon really shines.\n\nIf you've been using TFA Cinnamon Spice, use FA Cinnamon Ceylon at the same percentage.\"\n\n[Cinnamon is hella interesting](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/3mwfyj/cinna_bon_cinna_non_a_bit_of_history_on_cinnamon/)\n\n[Some people get a curry note out of this stuff, check the comments. I can see that lower but by the time you get a nice spicy cinnamon note that complexity seems long gone.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/4dnwye/lets_talk_about_cinnamon/)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)** ","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Cinnamon Ceylon","url":"https://redd.it/5svh68","vendor":{"name":"Flavour Art","code":"FA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FA","title":"Cinnamon Ceylon"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
