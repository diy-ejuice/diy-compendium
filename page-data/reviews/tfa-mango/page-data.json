Becomes similar to a mango puree after a week steep, more of a soft/mellow mango flavor as compared to the brightness/juiciness of a ripe mango. After two weeks it tastes much closer to a ripe and juicy mango but it still has a bit of that 'puree' element to it, with a dash of brightness that makes it more fresh fruit like.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Starts off tasting like a mango puree or artificial juice, mostly fades out by two weeks.\n\n**Throat hit:** Most noticeable at the end, I give it 4 or 5 out of 10. I may have have over-nic'd it (oops). \n\n**Uses:** Good in a tropical mix, or could do well as a base in a melon vape because of that thicker 'puree' quality.\n\n**Pairings:** Tropical fruits, other melons, maybe creams.\n\n**Notes:** So far I've been most successful using it in a Monster Melon's clone, and it does a very nice of providing a mango flavor throughout the entire vape. Doubtful of if it would make a good main note though, the profile just isn't right for it. It would need to be more bold or bright.\n\n**Rating:** 7/10.\n\nFirst time that I'm making my own flavor notes post, please let me know if there are any areas that need improvement- i.e. more or less details in a specific section.","author":"wafflepriest1","title":"Mango","url":"https://redd.it/4qss5o","vendor":{"name":"The Flavor Apprentice","code":"TFA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"TFA","title":"Mango"}},
