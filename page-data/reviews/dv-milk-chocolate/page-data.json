Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Decadent Vapours Milk Chocolate, 5% and 10%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 60 days.\n**Flavor Description:**  Slightly dry, moderately full milk chocolate flavor without any egregious off-notes.\n\nChocolate here lines up pretty well with milk chocolate.  Mild chocolate, without a really aggressive darker cocoa taste.  Nothing too sour or butryic.  The chocolate here isn’t too fruity or too plastic, at least at tested percentages.  Does seems to get a bit dry but not aggressively chalky either.  Missing anything waxy like TPA Double Chocolate Clear.  Drier, cocoa type body without much mouthfeel.\n\nThis vapes a whole like chocolate syrup, which seems to be about par for the course with milk chocolate flavors.  While I’m am getting a milk chocolate appropriate type of cocoa level, it just doesn’t have much in the way of richness or body behind it.  It’s not exactly thin, but the chocolate here feels a bit one note and not particularly saturated through the entire flavor. \n\nPretty accurately sweet to a milk chocolate, but not completely cloying at tested percentages.  Not a super dark concentrate, and seems no gunkier than TPA Double Chocolate Clear.  Wicks have gotten a bit crispy and flavor starts to feel muted with extended vaping, but no horrendous coil gore.\n\n**Off-Flavors:**  Pretty standard lack of richer chocolate body.  Mostly just a slightly dry chocolate syrup type vape instead of some magical chocolate bar.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light to moderate, seems to get a bit dry and harsh solo.  Some of that could just be the wicks getting crispy.  Less harsh freshly dripped.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 5% this is feeling fairly light.  I’m getting some drier cocoa flavor here, but the actual chocolate feels pretty thin on top of a sort of neutral base.  Nothing particularly rich at this percentage.\n\nAt 10%,  the chocolate is coming through a bit more clearly.  That cocoa note seems a bit deeper and less dry.  I’m still not sure this is clicking for me as rich.  It’s sort of thick without feeling especially creamy.\n\nDV has their usual 20% rating, and this felt a little chalky and plastic-y up that high.  I didn’t think it really offered much of a benefit for the extra 10%.  Just based on these tests, I’d probably be using this around 12-14% as a primary note, and maybe 6-8% as an accent.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Serviceable milk chocolate flavor, but I’m not sure there is anything to really recommend it over something like JF or FLV Milk Chocolate or FA Chocolate, especially given the difficulty in sourcing and pricing. \n\nIn general, it’s going to do a bit better with something heavy and creamy behind it to stand in for a richer cocoa butter base.  You’re mostly looking at custards or maybe a heavier cream like a Bavarian or thicker whipped cream.  Some Acetyl Pyrazine can also help solidify the chocolate as well.\n\nStick it any place you’re looking for a sweeter chocolate accent, basically.  Chocolate flavors in general seem to kind of diffuse through a vape instead of really keeping any texture or separation, so you’re probably better off trying for a chocolate ice cream instead of a chocolate chip ice cream, just by way of an example.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  This is another bulk or wholesale from DV, and I’m not seeing much info out there about it. \n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Milk Chocolate","url":"https://redd.it/8ddtmx","vendor":{"name":"Decadent Vapours","code":"DV"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"DV","title":"Milk Chocolate"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
