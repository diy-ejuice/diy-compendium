    "result": {"data":{"reviewsJson":{"markdown":"**Setup:** Plume Veil RDA; dual parallel @ .35Î©; cotton wicks; 45W\n\n**Testing:** INW Pineapple @ 4%; Aged: 2 days\n\n**Flavor description:** Juicy, sweet, authentic pineapple.  Similar to eating an actual fresh pineapple. \n \n**Off-flavors:**  None noticed.  \n\n**Throat hit:** 6/10. \n\n**Uses:**  Use as an accent at low % to citrus and tropical fruits, or bump it up to 3-5% for a satisfying main note.\n\n**Pairings:** Citrus fruits, tropical fruits, coconut, light creams or vanillas.  \n\n**Notes:**   Not overly strong @ 4%, surprising for an INW fruit.  I use some CAP Golden Pineapple to spruce it up a bit.  The INW version is somewhat earthy compared to CAP Golden Pineapple.\n\nEDIT: [Link to all of our flavor reviews in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)","author":"wh1skeyk1ng","title":"Pineapple","url":"https://redd.it/4pzxvj","vendor":{"name":"Inawera","code":"INW"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"INW","title":"Pineapple"}},
