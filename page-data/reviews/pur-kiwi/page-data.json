    "result": {"data":{"reviewsJson":{"markdown":"Percentage Used:* 6%\n\nEquipment Used:  Troll RDA with a single Kanthal .3 ohm Staircase coil at 27W. 24g kernel with 32g wrap, cotton wick.\n\nPG/VG: 30/70\n\nSteep Time: 5 Days\n\nAroma: Slightly artificial kiwi, tang, sweet.\n\nFlavor Description: This is pretty artificial tasting kiwi. Sweet and juicy, with a very very faint tang. This seems like a kiwi candy versus the fresh fruit. It needs less sweet and more tang. \n\nOff Flavors: Candy?\n\nThroat Hit: 2/10\n\nPairings: Strawberry, pear, melons, tropical fruits, coconut. Candy or fruit gum.\n\nNotes: This is pretty full flavored at this strength for a single flavor. Could maybe push it to 7-8% if you like a strong flavor. Probably 1-2.5% in mixes.","author":"mysticrosell","title":"Kiwi","url":"https://redd.it/6s4rgq","vendor":{"name":"Purilum","code":"PUR"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"PUR","title":"Kiwi"}},
