Max VG, steeped 7 days.\n* **Flavor Description:** Banana with a heavy cream/custard. It is similar to a banana pudding. \n* **Off-flavors:** Not one that I can place. Maybe a very light Runts, but not nearly as bad as LA Banana Cream.\n* **Throat Hit:** 0/10.\n* **Uses & Pairings:** This flavoring definitely has its uses. If you just want a nice Banana pudding, this is a great base to work with. I think this would pair well with Cinnamon, Caramel, Cakes, Pies, Basically anything that is not fruit. Not that this wouldn't pair with fruit, but we have LA Banana Cream that is fantastic with pairing with fruits. So keep this paired with your more bakery, milkshake, pudding type flavors.  \n* **Notes:** This flavor definitely has its place as I said before. It should not be a competition between LA and TFA for these two flavors because they have 2 completely different uses. We should add both flavors to our toolbox and use them accordingly.   \n\nIf you are looking for more mixing related content subscribe to my [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcfR6mXMRm-Iu3psoDrxGyA)\n\nIf your opinion differs from mine or you have anything to add feel free to comment below, and as always Keep Mixing!","author":"cloudstatevapor","title":"Banana Cream","url":"https://redd.it/5wr73x","vendor":{"name":"The Flavor Apprentice","code":"TFA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"TFA","title":"Banana Cream"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
