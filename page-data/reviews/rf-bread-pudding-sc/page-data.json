There are subtle hints of cinnamon, vanilla, and maybe nutmeg. overall this is a great generic bread pudding taste!\n\n**Off-flavors:** not really\n\n**Throat Hit:** none\n\n**Uses and Pairings:** this seems to be a great place to start for a bread pudding recipe. this could be vaped solo but who does that? this could benifit from added cinnamon, clove, and/or vanilla. you could go to town with fruit like apple, apricot, raisin, and other dried fruits; or perhaps go nuts with nut flavors like pecan, peanut, almond, and walnut. honey or sugar flavors would not be out of place as a pairing. oh, and spices! 1-2% seems like a good range for this.\n\n**Notes:** The steep time on this is not one month, I just procrastinated on my testing. I'd say one or two weeks should do it judging by the other RF(SC) I've tried. most of the second opinions i found were about the VG based bread pudding, but im going to say that they are most likely close enough except for steep times.\n\n**Second Opinions:** [From Real Flavors: \"When it comes to bread pudding, there are a multitude of regional variations. However the moist vanilla sweetness remains the same. Our delicious flavor is made from a cherished family recipe using bread, milk, eggs, raisins, vanilla, spices and more. Excellent on its own, this is one of our most popular offerings.\"](http://www.realflavors.com/shop/bread-pudding-super-concentrate/)\n\n[Our very own /u/mysticrosell's review of the VG Bread Pudding](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/4rhgvy/rf_or_real_flavors_bread_pudding_review/)\n\nFrom /u/To0nMaN: [When i make it i make it with homemade cinnamon rolls instead of bread so you have the bready cinnamon notes in a nice heavy custard and a light drizzle of cream cheese frosting. This seems to be what this flavoring was modeled after.\nThere are many variations on bread pudding, some have fruits and/or nuts. Some made with pudding and some made with custard.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/4jt29r/real_flavors_brand/d39shif/) This is about the VG version but I imagine they are similar. However, I do not taste ANY kind of icing/frosting.\n\nAnonymous states (about the VG version): [VG version. Tested at 10 day steep 15% standalone. Very good, not too rich, could adv easily by itself. Flavor is good at this percentage, but deepens and strengthens a lot near the 4 week steep mark. Try at 3-4 weeks before raising percentage. Well balanced, just a light hint of cinnamon and really an authentic bread pudding. Would be great with a vanilla or caramel sauce, or topped with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream. Lots of possibilities with this one. I have noticed with this brand of flavorings that they really come out at/after 4 weeks. Worth the wait!\n@4 week steep. This is even more delicious with steeping. Very good SF for me in a tank at 15%. I have made a few recipes, and this flavor is a little touchy. 2-3% creams added to it in any combination has a tendency to mute it. A clear baking type vanilla like FA Classic or Tahiti accents it very well if you like more vanilla. I will be vaping this a lot, awesome bread pudding and hard to find flavor. They do it well.](http://www.realflavors.com/shop/bread-pudding/)\n\nMore on Gremlins page:MORE OF A FRENCH TOAST FLAVOR  4 Star Review\nPosted by Unknown on Feb 26th 2017\n\nNot sure I like it...but cant stop vaping it. 12% at 5 weeks. Reminds me of a french toast with a yeasty flavor. Slightly sour raisin on the exhale. \nIts different and I find myself craving it.\n\nSTRAIGHT FROM MOMMA'S OVEN  5 Star Review\nPosted by Lisa on Jun 25th 2016\n\nTested at 10 day steep 15% standalone. Very good, not too rich, could adv easily by itself. Flavor is good at this percentage, but deepens and strengthens a lot near the 4 week steep mark. Try at 3-4 weeks before raising percentage. Well balanced, just a light hint of cinnamon and really an authentic bread pudding. For my personal tastes would like a hint more vanilla. Would be great with a vanilla or caramel sauce, or topped with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream. Lots of possibilities with this one. I have noticed with this brand of flavorings that they really come out at/after 4 weeks. Probably because of the vg, but worth waiting for!\n\n[@4 week steep.

A clear baking type vanilla Like FA Classic or Tahiti accents it very well if you like more vanilla. I do have one with whipped cream and one with vanilla sauce that is very good, but I had to keep the bread pudding up at 12% and creams under/around 3%.
