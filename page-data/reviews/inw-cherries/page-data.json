Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** INW Cherries @ %1, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 10 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  A cherry flavor that doesn't taste like plastic! A light, rainier cherry sweetness with a spicy dry peel note. A really light flavor, never really giving you a solid body and instead of just coloring everything it touches with a bit of cherry.\n\nInhale is slighty airy rainier cherry sweetness.  I think the spicier, drier top note is sort of accentuating the airy-ness here.  Inhale actually has a slightly deeper cherry flavor than the exhale.  Exhale has a lighter rainier cherry sweetness right down the middle. No floral component here, although the top notes taste a lot like raw vg.  Back half of the exhale has spicier, tannic, dry top notes that show up out of that raw vg taste.  Relatively clean finish, with some lingering dryness.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  I'm getting a decent amount of spiciness here. Hard to place, not like distinct cloves like INW Cherry Concentrate, more like a dry, earthy, tannic, berry skin kind of spice. Almost like blueberry skins. No plastic though, so that's cool.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Light, mostly from the dryness.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:** So this tastes really great, but it doesn't have much body. It needs some help getting up to a full saturated cherry flavor. Something like INW Cherry at .75% helps provide a richer, fuller bottom end of a cherry while letting this fill in the top notes.  In the same vein, FA Apricot or an apple or pear flavor can fill in some of the juicier low-end you'd expect from a fuller cherry.\n\nUseful to add really distinct cherry top notes to fruit mixes. Non-floral and pretty mellow, so your fruit pairings are basically wide open.  Doesn't seem to like stand up front solo, so you'll likely end up with a cherry twinge as opposed to a distinct cherry flavor.\n\nThis is also the cherry you want to use if mixing with creams or bakeries. You won't get a ton of body, but there is nothing here that will clash with heavy dairy notes or dense bakeries.  Using some marzipan will help to really fill in the base of a baked cherry flavor for fillings and the like.\n\n**Notes:**  I'm having some serious issues getting something that feels like a full, saturated vape from this concentrate solo. This stuff seems really airy, no matter the percentage. S&V concentration testing, this is noticeable but light at .5%.  I get some lighter cherry top notes and that light spice note.  1% is still seeming very airy.  This seems to be mostly top notes without any substantial body.  The actual flavor here is good, it's just fairly subtle. 2% is largely similar, if a bit heavier on that dry spicy top note.  3% has a good tart rainier cherry note, but again those drier spicy top notes are getting in the way. 4% is finally starting to push towards medicinal, but there is no weird plastic note. Still dry, tart, and spicy.  The good news is that this is a pretty forgiving mixer. I don't think your going to run a mix by working with a heavy hand here. I'd start with this at 1% if you want to add a bit of cherry to a fruit mix. I'd probably bump up to about 2.5% and work up for mixing with bakeries, creams, or as a strong cherry that you're going to fill in with a juicier base.\n\nAll in all, a really good flavor... I just wish it hit a bit harder. Solo, I can't personally get away from the thinner, drier, airy character of this concentrate. I think it's a great mixer, but not like the one-shot answer to all your cherry prayers.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[ELR is mostly just one repackaged review talking about tasting like \"wild cherry, maybe Swiss with a little back-note of maraschino.\"](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/33818)\n\n[Glowing reviews on BCF.](http://www.bullcityflavors.com/cherries-inw/)  Realistic, not cough syrup, \"best cherry flavor\" appears multiple times.\n\n[Cheeba likes it, so that's something.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/5wys09/inw_cherry_concentrate/deeinl0/)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Cherries","url":"https://redd.it/5x5u8p","vendor":{"name":"Inawera","code":"INW"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"INW","title":"Cherries"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
