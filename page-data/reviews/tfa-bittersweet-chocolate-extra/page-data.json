More a dark chocolate than milk, with s very light creaminess. Sweeter than semi sweet chocolate, with light floral notes, and also slightly nutty.\n\n**Relatable Flavors**\n\nReminds me of mocha coffee flavoring would definitely pair well.\n\n**Off Flavors**\n\nThere is not much of that usual chocolate chalky flavor, in fact this may be the least chalky chocolate I have tasted so far.\n\n**Position In The Recipe**\n\nI could see this working well as a base note and an accent. Not too bad as a standalone at 5%.\n\n**Pairings**\n\nBakeries, tobacco's, candies, coffees, nuts, and most fruits especially Orange.\n\n**Recipe**\n\n https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/7811\n\n**Notes**\n\nThis is a very clear flavoring and I having seen no gunking of my coils, similar to Double Chocolate clear in that way.\n\nAs always hear some more information on Bittersweet Chocolate and where to find it.\n\n https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chocolate\n\n http://www.bullcityvapor.com/bittersweet-chocolate-extra-tfa/\n\n**Rating** 90/100\n\n*Please if your opinion differs, or you have another review for this post it in the comments.
