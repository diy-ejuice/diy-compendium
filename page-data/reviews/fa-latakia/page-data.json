Not sure how to use it yet and I damn sure won't be vaping it as a stand alone.\n- This is similar to TFA Cubano in profile, they both have that vegetal taste which to me is a dead ringer for charred green peppers. However, I much prefer this to the Cubano.\n- This will be another one that needs finesse to make it useful.","author":"T_Mace","title":"Latakia","url":"https://redd.it/6a84f5","vendor":{"name":"Flavour Art","code":"FA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FA","title":"Latakia"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
