But what it is, is lovely. I'd call this the FLV Kentucky Blend of the bunch I've tried so far and I'll tell you why. It's kind of an all-in-one for me: ever so slightly ashy, full, dark (but not too dark) tobacco with a hint of sweet to make it just an all around pleasant flavor. I ripped through about 15 mL of this before I even thought to write down some notes, I just simply enjoyed it.\n\nKinda thought I was going crazy for a sec because I thought it was SC/FE Cigar and my nose notes on that one was more of their chocolate note base scents than what I had written for this one: ash/leaf/AP. It does have a teensy bit of APish-ness to me in a not unpleasant way, but it does take a little bit away from the overall vibe for me. This can easily be covered up or, more likely, played into by adding either a nutty bacco flavor or or idk simply any other tobacco, I think should do the trick. I don't get that weird chocolate base note that I picked up off the nose or that is overly present in some of these flavors. It isn't moist or sryupy exactly but it's close here at 2%, probably could pair well with some drier body filling or just other blended flavors.\n\n*Suggested percent:* I'd likely start at 2.5-3% if it were for a single flavor profile or solo flavor, maybe 1.5-2 for if I just wanted to accent this flavor and see which way I could bend it.\n\n*Pairing ideas:* Truly an enjoyable flavor, I could see pairing this with lots of things. It has some sweet already in it so I could see (1) blending this into a legit dessert tobacco for those sweet tooth people, (2) using this as a sweet body filler for a more complex tobacco, or (3) just vaping this as a solo flavor with a hint of this and a dash of that. \n\nI'd tried with the last 10mL of my sample:\n[Bacco Blend No. 4](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/253504) \n2 cohiba\n0.5 Red Burley\n0.75 Cured\n0.5 INW Shisha Vanilla\nit was maybe a little off in that the cohiba had steeped for two weeks and kinda lost some of what was 'fun' about the cohiba for the first day. Day 2, the leafier/ashier parts of Cohiba was boosted significantly and the vanilla blended in more. In fact, I destroyed this mix by the day's end and am looking forward to trying some more options. I can see going in a whole host of directions from here. Add some straight leaf with 7 leaves to get a slight wrapper vibe, or add CT Shade to go full on, accent with coffee note heavy ry4 like flv or fa, or go caramel/nut. This one has serious potential imo.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n[T_Mace Review](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/5z0kyb/sc_cohiba/)\n\n> **Flavor Properties:**\n> -   cigar style tobacco with an authentic feel\n> -   dry\n>     \n> -   layered overall profile\n>     \n> \n> **Relatable Flavors:**\n> \n> -   leathery tobacco note upfront\n>     \n> -   cigar leaf notes\n>     \n> -   hint of plum on the exhale (like how tobacco smells, almost sweet but just a touch)\n>     \n> -   very soft, almost muted chocolate note comes out as the vapor extends (reminds me of a cigar wrapper)\n\nELR User Kinnikkinnick:\n> Super nice cigar flavor; almost sweet in nature; low ash content, so a bit of INW DNB might be useful.\n\n## Final Thoughts\nYes, please. This one was great. You gotta like a bolder tobacco, for sure. But, if you dont, then get over yourself and get this one. I tried my hand at making a balanced mix out of this. While good, it still felt like it tamped down the better qualities of this flavor instead of boosting them. I highly recommend this for the lovers of strong baccos, not even necessarily cigar lovers or even people who want a more one-shotty type solo flavors. It's not perfect but no single concentrate really is. With the little bit of everything vibe (ash, leaf, dark, musky, full, accents) you can solo this and just keep tossing in a pinch of this and a dash of that to get all kinds of variation with very little effort. Considering the dearth of decent cigar flavors, although mild to me, this one may be the best I've had outside FM TB Cohiba.","author":"isuamadog","title":"Cohiba","url":"https://redd.it/rnkyfv","vendor":{"name":"Super Concentrated","code":"SC"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"SC","title":"Cohiba"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
