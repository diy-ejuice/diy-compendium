That leather note is common between the two.\n- If you're looking to build a cigar or a hearty cig flavor like Marlboro Red, pick this flavor up and enjoy.","author":"T_Mace","title":"Cohiba","url":"https://redd.it/5z0kyb","vendor":{"name":"Super Concentrated","code":"SC"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"SC","title":"Cohiba"}},
