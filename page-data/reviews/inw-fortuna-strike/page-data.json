Tobacco in the background. Not too sweet. \n\n**Off-flavors:** none\n\n**Throat hit:** 5/10. Pretty mellow. \n\n**Uses:** In the 5% range with other tobaccos around the 2% range, it adds a wonderful plum back note to the mix. In the current version of a recipe I have, I use this ratio. The shake and vape test left me a little disappointed because the plum disappeared. After four days, it came back just the right amount to give it that hint of a darker sweetness I was looking for. \n\n**Pairings:**  Tobaccos, maybe some nuts. Don't try to over complicate it though. It's already a decent flavor stand alone. I would suggest to throw in .5% Dirty Neutral Base to bring out a bit more of the smoke in \"smoked plum.\" When using as a back note in a mix, go a little higher than you usually would with your supporting cast, or you might not get the flavor to come back. I can't really speak to if it will work with fruits, as I don't have any fruits to play with. It could probably work with something that isn't \"candy sweet\" though. \n\n**Notes:** The only place I saw that carries this flavor is Wizard Labs, which may make it a compromise for some to get a hold of. I couldn't find any mention of it on here, and very limited info on it anywhere else. Very happy to have found it though. From what I could find, I think it may be a clone of a Chinese juice called Fortune Strike. Never tried it, so I can't say if it's a good clone. But I can say it's a welcome addition to my stash. \n\n**Bonus Recipe**\n\nIngredient | Percentage\n---|---\nINW Fortuna Strike | 4%\nINW Dark for Pipe | 2%\nTFA Graham Cracker Clear | 1.5%\n\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ChemicalBurnVictim","title":"Fortuna Strike","url":"https://redd.it/5k8pyk","vendor":{"name":"Inawera","code":"INW"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"INW","title":"Fortuna Strike"}},
