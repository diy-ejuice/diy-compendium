    "result": {"data":{"reviewsJson":{"markdown":"**setup:** Derringer clone; single fused clapton; 50w \n\n**testing:**  FLV pumpkin bread @ 2% & 4% ; 70/30; aged 2 weeks\n\n**Flavor Description**  A predominately bread flavor. Notes of  savory rye, and wheat with a hint of sugar pumpkin at the end of the exhale.  It almost has the \"baked\" flavor from a fresh loaf of multi-grain bread. Its lacking any kind of spice, making this a pretty versatile flavor, as it could be used as plain bread.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  the rye flavor is pretty dominant. To me its enjoyable, but to some it might be kinda strange. personal i think this is pretty spot on to savory pumpkin bread. @ 4% it started becoming reminiscent of popcorn, as that toasted grain flavor gets more in your face. \n\n**Throat hit/ Mouth feel:** [2/19]  [3/10]\n\n**Uses:** an excellent base for any beady profile. Couldn't really see it as a top note, but possibly accent other bakeries or tobaccos\n\n**pairings:** Bakeries, creams, apples, spices, pumpkin, tobaccos. would avoid sharp fruits with lots of high notes.\n\n**notes:** this is the first savory bakery flavor I have found and liked. Its still a little sweet but it definitely is in another realm from other bakery style flavors. Its not too dark and burnt (looking at you INW waffle) but its not too sweet either.
