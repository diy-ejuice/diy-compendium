Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** INW Purple Rain @ 1%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 21 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Inawera bills this as violet and vanilla. It's definitely in the neighborhood. Tastes a whole like violet top notes on top of a vanilla base instead of one cohesive flavor. The violet flavor is actually pretty nice, less aggressively floral than FA Violet. Vanilla is a warm middle-of-the road vanilla without anything too sharp or distinct. Overall effect pushes towards an elderflower cream.  Really interesting.\n\nInhale is floral, some perfumey bitterness with a light green note. The violet is right in front of the exhale. Starts off a little green and then has a high perfumey violet almost elderflower top note. Vanilla comes in underneath that a bit later in the exhale and warms up the concentrate substantially. Really neutral vanilla, more in line with a whipped cream instead of a straight extract or candy vanilla. Lingering perfume on the exhale but fairly restrained for a floral. Really light pleasant sweetness throughout the entire exhale with some moderate density coming through with the vanilla.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Nah. Violet and vanilla, just like Inawera says.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Light. Mostly with the floral notes. Nothing major.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**\n\nSo this was probably intended as a one-shot, and that is probably the best use I can think of. The warm vanilla tames the floral violet quite a bit. The overall effect is pretty solid.\n\nThis would be a good sub for FA Violet at a slightly higher percentage. I can't think of a use for violet where the vanilla would be unpleasant or flagrantly out of place.\n\nThis should pair well with a sweeter citrus. It would add a really interesting dimension to something like a tangerine cream, with maybe a shortbread style of cookie.\n\nI can also see value in cocktail vapes, as it would be a good stand-in for a creme de violette and the florals would work well FA Gin. [There is a recipe for an aviation cocktail on ELR that looks super interesting.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/recipe/1016242/Aviator%20%28FM%20Gin%20series%29)\n\n**Notes:**\n\nLike most Inawera, this is pretty potent stuff. I feel like it's a bit indistinct under .5%, with a pretty full floral and vanilla coming through at .75%. Vanilla picks up quite a bit at 1% and over, but 1.5% is the limit for me before the violet gets too perfumey.  I'd mix at .75% and use 1.5% either as a solo flavor or a primary note.\n\nI like florals, but I'm assuming you do too if you're still reading. Overall, a really nice concentrate.   It's going to be a pain to mix with, but probably less so than most other florals. A really solid one-shot at 1.5%.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Some test reports on Inawera's forum.](http://www.forum.inawera.com/viewtopic.php?f=152&t=3938&p=23444&hilit=PURPLE+RAIN#p23444)  Posts have an english translation along with the polish.\n\n[One note on ELR, very floral but the mix of vanilla and violet is good.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/103856)\n\n[Super important research on the subject.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vJMTKtY4U8)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Purple Rain","url":"https://redd.it/5kco2j","vendor":{"name":"Inawera","code":"INW"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"INW","title":"Purple Rain"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
