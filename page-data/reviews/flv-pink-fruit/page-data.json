All done on a Falcon King bamboo fiber 75w yada yada \n\nThis is a review btw.\n\nSo I got this baby by accident (which was very swiftly corrected by the super helpful staff over at Chefs Flavours, love those people even if the FB group is perma flooded with odd stuff but hey that's what FB groups are for) and I decided I might as well try it. Risky seeing as there were no reviews and I couldn't put the smell to any specific fruit.\n\nI mean this is basically TPA Dragonfruit on steroids but seeing as neither Dragonfruit nor steroids have much of a smell might as well jump straight into the flavour details.\n\n0.5% is nice and tart as a shake and vape. However, in just 3 hours it quickly dissolved into just a fairly nice creamy/jammy base. Nothing fascinating after it did that.\n\n1% Same but a bit sharper.\n\n2% Same but went super muddied super quick, borderline unpleasant. \n\nNow on it's own it's nada fascinating but I compared it to TPA's Dragonfruit with Guanabana and then separately with FLV's Peppermint (and then altogether made a really nice recipe I ADV which I'll post at the bottom of this) and damn does this baby shit all over TPA Dragonfruit. \n\nTPA Dragonfruit just sort of sloppily blends flavours, dulling this, killing off that, it doesn't contribute at all I feel to the mix. This baby not only shapes up the mixture to be a perfect little not too sharp not too dull mix but also has a very nice flavour of its own. Of course, that makes it so that it's use might be a bit more limited than TPA Dragonfruit, but then again I only had the mixes with 1% Pink Fruit, maybe at 0.5% it works just as well (2% is too high in a mix, it makes shit too muddied and made me gag a bit). \n\nI honestly don't know what to say to describe the flavour. I can't claim that it tastes like pink fruit because female genitalia doesn't really go for that sort of taste profile (sorry for the joke). \n\nIt mixes greatly so far with mints, menthols, cooling, no cooling, guanabana, banana (I imagine, I don't vape banana), Fanta Exotic at 2 drops per glass (diet one, I hate the super sugary ones) and basically anything I've put it in. Even anise and blackcurrant. \n\nIf dragonfruit's an emulsifier with a nice smell, this is a better emulsifier with a nice smell and a nice taste. \n\n11/10 recommend it.\n\nP.S: Here my [new adv recipe with it](https://e-liquid-recipes.com/recipe/3383685/The Chain)\n\nP.P.S: A [further note](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/ej6r3j/flv_pink_fruit_or_the_better_tpa_dragonfruit/fcy0602) in the thread about this flavour. I was a fool and decided it sucks at 2% and didn't even attempt on going higher. I'll mix a batch at 4% and 5% to experiment and will update this thread accordingly when it's done steeping!\n\nP.P.P.S: [And a further/part 2 review here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/elz4hg/flv_pink_fruit_further_analysis_and_usage_as_a/?)","author":"RoninVX","title":"Pink Fruit","url":"https://redd.it/ej6r3j","vendor":{"name":"Flavorah","code":"FLV"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FLV","title":"Pink Fruit"}},
