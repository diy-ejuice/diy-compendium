Flakes seem dominent? \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Flavor Description:** This is one of the better cereals I've tasted. Mild naturally sweet crispy corn flakes. It has the slight grain flavor without being dry. Noticeable full mouth feel, this has an authentic generic cereal flavor, and has avoided the sandy over done oat flavor I usually get from most cereals. This is going to be a very versatile flavor.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:** None\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit:** 1/10\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Pairings:** Cereals, desserts, bakeries, crust, anywhere you want to add body. Breads, donuts, dough, any fruit, cream, milk, vanilla, cookie, apple pie, custards, cake.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Notes:** I'm planning on using 7-9% for SF and 2-6% for blends.\n\n","author":"mysticrosell","title":"Cereal","url":"https://redd.it/5mwq76","vendor":{"name":"Purilum","code":"PUR"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"PUR","title":"Cereal"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
