Still not weak, just a very delicate flavor, and it's obvious with the sniff test, so I started this one a bit higher than the others. I got a very very sweet pile of powdered sugar with a hint of greasiness overlaying a slight play doh. Not really much dough or cake yet. Definitely needs a longer steep time on this one.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nLet me say that I am one of the unlucky ones that can only taste Play Doh with CAPs Donut as well, so if you don't you won't taste that in here either.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Steep Time:** 1 Week\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis has strengthened and developed a deeper flavor. It's still very light, and I am now getting a very small hint of play doh every 3rd or 4th hit instead of every one. Except extremely sweet. I am now tasting a weak amount of greasy dough that is drowned in powder sugar. For me, the sweetness is so much more pronounced than the dough, it's not balanced at all. I don't get that light fluffy fried dough from it. I can almost taste it though. Hard to tell with this one. I am going to taste this again at 4 weeks to see if the sugar settles and the dough comes out. I am also going to mix another one at 2.5% and see if a little bit stronger blend will bring the dough more forward without being too sweet. And no, this doesn't taste of cinnamon. If you are looking for cinnamon, I would recommend a churro flavoring. This dough so far will not stand up against adding cinnamon. So still undecided on this flavor, further testing required.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Steep Time:** 4 Weeks\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAt the 4 week steep, the occasional hint of play doh has completely disappeared, as well as the greasy flavor. It does taste like a very authentic funnel cake, including the powdered sugar flavor. The overwhelming sugar has calmed down, and although still very sweet, it's more balanced with the cake now. It is a very light flavor though. At least at this percentage. My concern is that the delicate flavor of the dough would disappear if mixed with any other flavors. However, the higher percentage of 2.5% may strengthen this a lot. I will update this with the stronger tests. If you are looking for just a funnel cake, this at a higher percentage would be great. Might also be good in lower percentages .5-1.5) for adding a powdered sugar flavor to bakery recipes as that is quite prominent.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nEDIT: Real Flavors has announced they will be changing the names of their Raw Extracts to Super Concentrates.","author":"mysticrosell","title":"Funnel Cake SC","url":"https://redd.it/55sgmh","vendor":{"name":"Real Flavors","code":"RF"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"RF","title":"Funnel Cake SC"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
