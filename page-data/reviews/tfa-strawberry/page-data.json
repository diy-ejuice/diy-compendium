I have also heard that it contains emulsifying properties so could even be an additive.      \n               \n**Pairings** - All the obvious creams, banana, other berries. Bakeries such as yellow cake, add a little caramel or butterscotch to sweeten it up.","author":"Chrisdvr1","title":"Strawberry","url":"https://redd.it/4lcy8v","vendor":{"name":"The Flavor Apprentice","code":"TFA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"TFA","title":"Strawberry"}},
