I couldn't detect any off flavors, and it's not overly sweet like a candy. At a 2 week steep this is a wonderful refreshing mint. I can't figure out if I'm tasting spearmint or wintergreen though. I am leaning more towards spearmint as I'm getting that faint fruitiness that is usually found in spearmint and it's very refreshing which is more common to spearmint. And the bite of the menthol in this is just slightly lower than peppermint but more than is usually in spearmint. It also is missing any hints of green or pine type flavor. Ok, based on all that jumbled criteria, I am going to say this is a moderately sweet refreshing spearmint with a little heavier level of menthol. Soothing and cool with that light generic fruitiness in the back note.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:** None\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit:** 5/10\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Pairings:** Almost any fruit, tobaccos, creams, coffees, teas, candy, mints, chocolate, cucumbers.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Notes:** I can taste a nice spearmint gum with this as a single flavor at 2-4%. Also a fantastic accent at .5-2% paired with watermelon which is one of my favorite pairings. I think tobaccos and teas will be great with this one as well.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Comparison:** FA White Winter is very similar, however it has a slight creaminess that isn't obvious in PUR's, and PUR is heavier in the menthol which gives it a little more of a cold kick and makes it seem a bit more refreshing.","author":"mysticrosell","title":"Arctic Mint","url":"https://redd.it/5sy9cu","vendor":{"name":"Purilum","code":"PUR"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"PUR","title":"Arctic Mint"}},
