Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Beer Nuts @ .5%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 12 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Salty nuts. Crispier, grainier roasted peanuts and a smoother almost raw creamy almond at the back. Does a pretty convincing job of tasting salty. Some weird iodine burn like you get from iodized table salt.\n\nInhale is sharp and nutty, with a stinging salty note. Dense with a roasted kind of sweetness. I get a honey roasted peanut at the front of the exhale, and a smoother creamier almond or cashew towards the back.  Still tastes fairly salty, although the inhale is a lot sharper and saltier than the exhale. Peanuts up front are moderately sweet and have a grittier texture.  Almond at the back has a denser body, without as much grit. Sweetness also tails off.  Lingering rawness in the mouth from that sharper salt flavor with an iodine burn.\n\n**Off Flavors:**  While this legit tastes salty I get a hint of some of that weird iodine note that FLV Peanut Butter. It's not as jasrring here as it is in Peanut Butter, but that could just be that this flavor seems to have a bit more going on.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Solo, this flavor has a bit of sting to it. You notice it pretty clearly on the inhale in the back of the throat and it tends to stick around your mouth through the entire vape. There's some more traditional throat hit, but that mouth rawness and sting is a little odd. I'm thinking it's tied to whatever flavorah is using to pull off salt.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Crisp and gritty enough to stand in for Acetyl Pyrazine without some of the weird fritos off-notes that come with AP.  Useful for adding texture and salt to a bakery. A lot of bakery flavors taste a little flat, like real baked goods do without salt.  This gives you the option of adding both texture and seasoning in one shot. AP is useful for making your chocolates come together, and this also brings in some some nuttiness to pair with the chocolate.\n\nFlavorah suggests this for mixing with tobaccos.  I think non-aromatic tobaccos are going to be your best bet, but I don't really \"get\" aromatic tobaccos, so YMMV.\n\n**Notes:**  This stuff is strong.  I'd stick to using this under at .5% and under.  At .25% you get strong but indistinct nuttiness with some pretty solid salt. At .5% The almond softer nut notes start to separate from that peanut up front.  At .75%, that saltiness is getting overwhelming.  !% is just about the useful ceiling here.  Decently nutty, crisp, and with a good body but that salt note is really sharp and heavy on that aforementioned Iodine edge.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nThere's not a whole lot out there right now...\n\n[Here's the product page from Flavorah.  Their description: \"Salty roasted bar style peanuts, dry mixed nuts. Earthy brazil nuts, smooth cashews and salty almonds. Wonderful sub-dimention for a dry finish. Can be used around tobacco flavors handily.\"](http://store.flavorah.com/concentrated-beer-nuts-flavor)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Beer Nuts","url":"https://redd.it/63k1eo","vendor":{"name":"Flavorah","code":"FLV"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FLV","title":"Beer Nuts"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
