Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Flavor Revolution Mango, 1,3 and 5%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 20 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Accurate but soft mango, primarily for accents.\n\nFairly realistic mango.  Texture is a bit dry to come across as accurately pulpy or juicy, but the actual flavor is pretty close to a ripe mango without any funkier overripe notes.  Sweetness is, again, pretty accurate.  Doesn't taste nearly as candied as the other flavor revolution fruits I've tried so far.\n\nThis does have a bit of a floral edge to it, especially at higher percentages.  Sort of perfumey bitter chemical floral, not something greener or piney like  real mango peel.  It's pretty subtle at lower percentages, but it ramps up quickly.\n\nJust a bit thin, dry, and soft.  Trying to crank up the flavoring gets floral and dry without really making the flavor feel fuller or more saturated. Flavor is relatively saturated on the inhale but fades out pretty quickly and gets thin by the end of the exhale.  Not too much in the way of a heavy, fuller base.\n\nComparing it to some of the mango flavors I've tried, seems the closest to TPA Philippine Mango, but maybe a bit more potent and less artificial.  Also has some of the same issues with fullness.  None of the heavy overripe notes of CAP Sweet Mango, but also a bit behind on a deeper, juicy body.  Less floral than FA Mango but almost a similar kind of dryness.  Not nearly as heavy and pulpy as FLV Mango.\n\n**Off-flavors:** A bit on the floral side.  Slightly bitter chemical taste to the floral top notes, especially at higher percentages.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light at workable percentages.  Gets harsh when it turns floral.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  This works fairly well at 1% for a softer mango flavor.  Realistic ripe mango, but it doesn't have a ton of vibrancy or fleshiness to it.  Sweetness level seems pretty on-point for a realistic mango.  Tail of exhale especially feels relatively thin.\n\nThis is substantially more floral at 3% and it's getting a bit dry.  Mango seems a bit brighter, but it's getting bitter and chemical.  Exhale is still pretty thin.\n\nAt 5%, this is heavily dry and floral without too much more actual mango flavor.\n\nJust based on these tests, I'd say the suggested 2% isn't far off.  Doesn't have the body for a primary flavor, but should work well between 1-2% as a realistic mango accent.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I\"d use this mostly to fill out flatter tropical flavors.  If you want to go full mango, this works pretty well to add a bit more dimension and pop to FLV Mango.  Should pair well with a heavier pineapple like CAP Golden Pineapple, one of the banana creams, or FLV Guanabana.\n\nOutside of tropicals, I'd be sticking with fuller, juicier fruits as this might dry out or add some floral notes with another drier, top heavy fruit.\n\nGood choice for subtle mango in creams, but it's a bit dry and thin for bakeries at least solo.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  Still fairly new.\n\n[One note on the ELR page.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/197392)  User \"juice junkie\" writes: \"Mixed at 2% and steeped a month. Used entheon rda 0.3 ohms 35 watts. This is a nice sweet mango flavor. It is quite different from other mangos that I have tried. It has a sweet and crispy taste to it. Really nice flavor! I think this would work great with strawberry, pineapple, coconut, and pink guava. Its a nice and light kind of mango flavor. It is not over powering but you can really taste it!\"\n\nAFAIK, these are only available through Nicotine River.  [The product page is here.](https://www.nicotineriver.com/collections/flavor-revolution-concentrates/products/flavor-revolution-mango)  Not much info besides a description: \"A sweet, floral tasting Mango! As if you were eating the golden inside of the Mango with a hint of the colorful outer skin. The perfect combination for any Mango lover! Suggested starting percentage: 2% and adjust to taste.\"\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**\n","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Mango","url":"https://redd.it/7k6dtg","vendor":{"name":"Flavor Revolution","code":"FR"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FR","title":"Mango"}},
