There are so many different directions you could take this flavoring from where it starts.\n\n**Pairings**\n\nOther candies such as TFA Swedish Fish, dark berries, tropical fruits, creams  such as  rainbow sherbert, and spices like Anis, Ginger, and cinnamon.\n\n**Recipe**\n\nhttps://alltheflavors.com/recipes/9192#simple_bubble_gum_by_chrisdvr1\n\n**Notes**\n\nHere is a Wikipedia on bubble gum and as always a bag to make it easy to find.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_gum\n\nhttp://www.bullcityvapor.com/bubble-gum-cap/\n\n**Rating** 70/100\n\n**Please if your opinion differs, or you have another review for this post it in the comments.
