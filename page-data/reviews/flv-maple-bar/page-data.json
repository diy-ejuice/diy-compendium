    "result": {"data":{"reviewsJson":{"markdown":"**Setup:** Recoil w/ flavor barrel, Dual 15 wrap 26g 3mm Nifethal 70 coils @.18 ohms.  60w power, 450F temp limit. Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Maple Bar @ 3%, 70/30 VG/PG, Steeped 2 weeks.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Fluffy and dry inhale.  It could be the power of suggestion, but I do get s slight hit of a yeast-risen donut.  Something a little bit more complex than a dryer cake donut.  Maple shows up on the exhale but it's really subtle as far as maple goes.  Very much a maple frosting and not an actual, from a tree, maple note. The exhale has more of that slightly yeasty fluffy bread texture and taste. Maple segregates itself to the beginning of the exhale.  Tail end is more of that bready donut taste.  Not oily, just fluffy.  Tastes a bit flat, but not bad for a single concentrate.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Bakery fluffyness can get a bit cardboard-y on the tail end of the exhale.  Not pronounced, but this stuff will dry your mouth out a bit after a big exhale.   \n\n**Throat Hit:** 2/10.  Not much \"harshness\" although the dryness does have a weird effect after vaping it for a while.\n\n**Uses:**  Pretty adequate single use flavor.  Probably better with a bit of added maple or other frosting flavor and maybe a little added richness.  If you aren't just going \"maple bar,\" then added volume in bakeries where a slight hit of maple isn't going to throw the entire recipe off.  Filled donuts that can stand some maple.\n\n**Pairings:**  Something like CAP Buttercream for added richness. I think dryer rich bakeries would compound the dryness issue here so I'd stick to just the butter and not the whole pastry. FA Joy would probably fry and sweeten the donut a bit. Maple, obvs. Butterscotch or Carmel could take the frosting in some interesting directions. Jammy darker fruits or custards may do a decent job of filling the donut.\n\n**Notes:** I'd like to see this without the maple.  It's not a bad maple flavor, just flat and subtle.  Without that maple, it's a pretty effective, if dry, yeast risen donut texture waiting for whatever else you want to throw at it.  And I do love that yeast-risen vibe, especially refreshing given the powdery cake-y note on other donut concentrates.\n\n[DIY_eJuice flavor reviews!](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Maple Bar","url":"https://redd.it/5bgvpw","vendor":{"name":"Flavorah","code":"FLV"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FLV","title":"Maple Bar"}},
