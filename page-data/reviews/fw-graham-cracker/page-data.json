    "result": {"data":{"reviewsJson":{"markdown":"**Setup:** Narda Clone, Single coil  26g Kanthal @.7 ohms.  25W Power, Half wicked with Native Wicks Platinum Blend\n\n**Testing:** FW Graham Cracker @ 5%. 70/30 VG/PG, steeped 5 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  This flavor is a plain honey graham cracker. More honey graham even then TFA's offering. It is sweet and buttery. It is a nice thick, crispy graham cracker taste, although not as dry or grainy as graham cracker clear, it is grainy and has quite a bit of nuttiness to it.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Nothing here, just delicious honey graham. Some people have said they get a bit of cinnamon with this flavor but I do not taste such a thing\n\n**Throat Hit:**  This flavor is pretty mild on the throat, a little dry on its own.\n\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This is the flavor I would use for a cheesecake. It is a very true, sweet graham cracker. I can see this being used to support other bakery flavors but I think the authenticity of this would get in the way if you weren't looking specifically for a graham cracker. I haven't tried this at lower percentages to see how it could work as an accent note though.\n\n\n**Notes:**\nThis is a very good flavor. It is FW so of course it is sweeter than its other counterparts. It was good right after shaken but the steep seemed to have brought out more of the graininess. \n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Wayne from DIY or Die](http://diyordievaping.com/2016/10/13/fw-graham-cracker/) seems to agree with me on the fact that there is no cinnamon. He also thinks it is on the more cookie end.\n\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**\n\nIf you have different opinions on the flavor or any ideas on how to use it please post them in the comments.
