I hope you're able to make use of the notes or enjoy the recipe.  \n**INW Cherimoya**  \nRecommended %: 1-3%  \nFlavor: Similar to that of a mixture between pineapple, banana, apple, and melon.  \nTexture/Palate: Slightly creamy, slightly sweet, very smooth, slightly perfumy.  \nProfile: Tropical  \n\nEver since I saw this flavoring, it’s had me interested. I went down to the market, picked out a cherimoya, and waited until it was ripe to consume. Being pleasantly surprised, I decided to check out the flavor. Again, I am pleasantly surprised. I honestly didn’t know what to expect from the flavoring, as the Cherimoya is a pretty unique fruit. It’s also quite tasty as a solo flavor.  \nThe Cherimoya flavor gains some additional creaminess as a vape and loses some of the acidity from the fruit that was a bit strong for me. To make up for this, you’re going to want to bring something to brighten up the cherimoya. It’s very easily overpowered though if you want it to be a main note, so use restraint. You’re probably going to end up with a very lightly flavored recipe when using this guy. I’ve found Cardamom to be the Cherimoya’s best friend.  \n  \n**Cherimoya’s friends:** *Cardamom*, Pineapple, apple, coconut, lemon, light creams, lychee  \n**Cherimoya bullies:** Heavy creams, earthy tones, dark flavor  \n\n**Cherimoya Rabri (Exotic Custard)**  80VG/20PG  \n* INW Cherimoya @ 3%  \n* FA Vienna Cream @ 2%  \n* FA Fresh Cream @ 1.5%   \n* FA Meringue @ 1%  \n* FA Almond @ 1%  \n* FA Cardamom @ .125%  \n* (Optional) FA Lychee @ .5%-1%  \n\n*Vienna Cream:* The Vienna Cream helps bring some creaminess and sweetness to the party as well as just a *touch* of vanilla. Surprisingly enough, vanilla does not play well with Cherimoya in my experience, and leaves the liquid muddy  \n*Fresh Cream:* Brings some more cream to the party without being too heavy.  \n*Meringue:* This one again brings out some sweet creaminess, but this is mostly used for its sweet properties. A traditional Rabri calls for some sugar, but you can't use a dark sugary profile, and you don't want to use sucralose to overshadow the delicate flavor of the Cherimoya.  \n*Almond:* Called for as a garnish in the Rabri, also brings some earthiness to the creams to make them a little more realistic. The nuttiness is just barely in the background keeping your palate interested.  \n*Cardamom:* This flavor makes the Rabri. It brings this slightly sweet, spicy tone to the party and really brightens up the Cherimoya and makes him the star. Without it, this flavor is really hard for me to work in to a recipe. You can take this lower, prob .25% if you don't like it as spicy, and I wouldn't bring it higher than .5% or it will take over.  \n*Lychee:* Lychee is a nice element that was in my original Exotic Custard that I wanted to keep. The original recipe for the Rabri actually calls for rose, and the Lychee makes a nice sort of fruity perfumey substitute for that. It actually plays well off of the slight perfuminess from the Cherimoya when used at low %  \n\nI tried a number of iterations trying to find out what would go well with the Cherimoya. I'm sure there are some good parings that I missed, so if you have any ideas I'd love to hear them.  \n\n**Edit - 2/25/16:** After throwing this in a tank, the cardamom seems a little heavy (had only been testing it on a dripper). I'll make a dilution of cardamom tonight and give it a go, I'm thinking .125%; minor tweaks to recipe to follow.  \n**Edit - 2/29/16:** So a good steep really makes that cardamom come through a little more than I want it to. I've dropped the cardamom to .125% (you could bring this as low as .0625% if you don't want the spiciness coming through too much) and upped the cream fresh a half of a percent","author":"CheebaSteeba","title":"Cherimoya","url":"https://redd.it/47c3tg","vendor":{"name":"Inawera","code":"INW"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"INW","title":"Cherimoya"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
