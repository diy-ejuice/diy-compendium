This has that straight out of the lunch box vibe. This has a subtle chemical vibe to it, but it could pass for licking the foil lid of a pudding pack. Thick mouthfeel, but not too eggy or sweet. This has a lot in common with RF (SC) Bread Pudding, so if you enjoy that flavor you may like this one. Not anywhere close to competition for CAP Vanilla Custard V1 sadly...\n\n**Off-flavors:** Odd chemical note. It seems to fade to the back after a few puffs, then disappears.\n\n**Throat Hit:** I'm not getting any.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:** Puddings, eclair, puddings, etc. Mouthfeel is great here, so anywhere you want to thicken a custard-based recipe.\n\n**Notes:** Not great solo for me, I'm not sure I will be using this too much even in a mix. That being said, it's not bad.\n\n**Second Opinions:** [Real Flavors description:](http://www.realflavors.com/shop/vanilla-custard/) \"The history of custard goes back as far as ancient Rome, and no wonder it lives on! This classic vanilla custard is brimming with creamy, eggy goodness. A thick delicious dessert by itself, it also blends beautifully with fruits…or for the adventurous, even with some savory flavors. The combinations are endless. What will you whip up?\"\n\nAnd a review on their site: \"4 out of 5\nDaniel H. – February 15, 2017:\nI give it a four. It is not bad. For those that don’t like an eggy custard this is for you.. 3 to 4 week steep.\" *I do get a mild egginess here*\n\n[fidalgo_vapes says:](http://forum.e-liquid-recipes.com/t/real-flavors-super-concentrates-tasting-notes/92474/1386) \"Real Flavors SC Vanilla Custard mixed @2.5 pct \n80vg 20pg made 3-28 tested 4-16 dual clapton .31ohms velocity v2\n\nSo i want to be fair here and get this out of the way i love creams and custard and i love what makes them great YES i love me some diketones , if i could id add some diacetyl here and there ( not really ) but imo they are what makes my fave creams /custards what they are , so obviously this isnt gonna make the cut for me ( my thought b4 vaping ) but to my surprise this Vanilla Custard isnt too bad and its been under a month No its not VCV1 but a hell of a lot better than VCV2 ( capella ) and id use it over tpa any day , i wont compare to FA because thats a different custard right ?? this though has its place in my line up, right now its lacking the vanilla id like to taste and the BA is heavy i could taste it instead of just smell and that worries me just a little bit usually a product that has BA has faded by now but being a custard im assuming its heavy here opposed to a lighter cream ( im assuming its BA ) mouthfeel is nice and it has a smooth creaminess so for me it could easily be a number two Vanilla Custard ill use it with FA cream whipped just to get some Diacetyl lol im anxious to try this again in a couple weeks\" *lots of RF (SC) notes on that page*\n\n[and finally /u/mysticrosell's VG version review](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/4rhci0/rf_or_real_flavors_vanilla_custard_review/)\n\nEdit: added quotation marks","author":"PerennialPhilosopher","title":"Vanilla Custard SC","url":"https://redd.it/680w74","vendor":{"name":"Real Flavors","code":"RF"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"RF","title":"Vanilla Custard SC"}},
