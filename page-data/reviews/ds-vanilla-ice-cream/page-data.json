Flavor @ 3, 4, 5, and 10%.\n\n**Notes:** If you combined homemade vanilla ice cream and cake frosting, you'd get something that's pretty close to this flavor. Ice cream is obviously sweet by nature, and this flavor fits the mold. The vanilla is bright, light, and prominent (if you've had WF Vanilla Cream Extra, it's like that with a much stronger vanilla note). There's no vanilla bean or vanilla extract notes to be found- again, this is not a dark vanilla flavor. At a higher percentage, it has a TFA Vanilla Swirl vibe, but it doesn't have the dairy/buttery note that I frequently get from Vanilla Swirl. This isn't vanilla soft serve, but I wouldn't call it slow-churned ice cream either. For me, it's stuck in this purgatory where it's not rich or creamy enough to be a full-blown ice cream, and it doesn't have the consistency to be a frosting. I'd say it's more of an even split between the two, like a tub of vanilla frosting that was kept in the freezer for far too long. It can be a SNV if used solo but shines most after a bit of a steep. With a steep, the sweetness calms down, and the vanilla smooths out and feels less sugary.\n\n**Mouthfeel:** I love the way this flavor feels in my mouth. I've found that a lot of concentrates with the lighter vanilla note have a consistency that is somewhat thin, but this isn't thin at all. There's a thickness at the end of the exhale that makes the whole flavor seem full-bodied. It's super smooth with no throat hit whatsoever, and it leaves a sweet stickiness behind that's really enjoyable. It's heaviness increases at higher percentages.\n\n**Off-notes:** No unsavory  tastes to be found. It gets pretty sweet the higher it goes, and it borders on becoming cloyingly sweet. Some people might like that, and some won't.\n\n**Suggested percentages and pairings:** This is going to be be a reasonably versatile concentrate. It'd pair nicely with berries, cookies, and cakes. It could also help in providing a boost to vanilla notes in other creams without overpowering them. There isn't anything specifically that I'd avoid- it's a vanilla which is pretty agreeable with a lot of things. I'd recommend using this anywhere from 2-4% in a mix. As a solo, it was great at both 4% and 5%. I used it at 10% (solo) in an old Innokin T22 tank, and it came through wonderfully. I really enjoyed this flavor.","author":"PepperMyJabrill","title":"Vanilla Ice Cream","url":"https://redd.it/e9urhw","vendor":{"name":"DuraSmoke","code":"DS"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"DS","title":"Vanilla Ice Cream"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
