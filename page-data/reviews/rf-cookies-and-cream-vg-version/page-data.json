It leans heavier towards the cookie. Chocolaty and crispy with a snap. Very dry. The cream flavor is very pleasant, but lacks the creamy mouth feel. Needs a cream to compliment it. Real Flavors are so good and complex, I'm not sure if I'm buying flavors, or premixed concentrates. Use between 8-12%. \n\n*These aren't my notes copy and pasted from the link below for a fantastic recipe!! original author is /u/Vurve you did such a good job I just wanted to throw them in*\n\n**Recipe**-  https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/4ig65a/cookies_and_cream_ice_cream/?ref=search_posts\n\n*Please if your opinion differs, or you have another review for this post it in the comments.
