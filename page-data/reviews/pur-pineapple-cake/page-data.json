Cloves?\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Flavor Description:** I didn't a chance to try this until a 4 week steep, so I'm not sure how it changes, fades or not, or is a good S&V. Sweet vanilla/yellow cake with authentic pineapple. The pineapple is sweet and not sharp at all, and also the first thing you taste. It's not a fresh cut pineapple, it's canned pineapple. But it tastes cooked like you would find in a pineapple upside down cake. The cake takes over on the exhale. It is a cross between a vanilla and a yellow cake. I can almost taste a faint hint of caramel or brown sugar In the cake itself, which swings it slightly to the yellow cake side, yet the vanilla is still present. There is no caramelized/brown sugar flavor to the pineapple like found in an upside down cake. It's part of the cake component, which is also just grainy enough to have a great cake body, but it's also somehow creamy. I'm not sure where the cream comes from, but it lingers there at the end of the exhale. It's almost like a butter? Overall a very complex flavor.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:** None\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit:** 3/10\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Pairings:** Other fruits that are typically good with pineapple. Bananas, coconut, cherry, tropical fruits especially . Cakes, creams, custards, nuts, specifically macadamia and pecans. Vanilla and butter. Whipped cream.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Notes:** This is an excellent cake base. Although I think it can be vaped single flavor in the 6-8% range, this will really shine in mixes. I will probably start at 4% as a base, then accent from there. I really like this one, a unique flavor.\n","author":"mysticrosell","title":"Pineapple Cake","url":"https://redd.it/6dknbv","vendor":{"name":"Purilum","code":"PUR"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"PUR","title":"Pineapple Cake"}},
