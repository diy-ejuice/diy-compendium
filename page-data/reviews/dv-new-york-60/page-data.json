Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Decadent Vapours New York 60, 5% and 10%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 56 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  More dessert than tobacco.  Caramel, coffee and biscuit mostly.\n\nFor me this leads with a pretty heavy digestive biscuit style flavor.  Less coconut off-note than I’m used  to with that kind of flavor, seems pretty well done. Mouthfeel is fairly crispy.  As the vape goes on I’m picking up some distinct softer caramel notes with a bit of buttery vanilla, and a moderately aggressive coffee finish.  Sort of tastes like a tiramisu type flavor, but with biscuit instead of sponge cake.  Distinctly sweet, with a bit of a stickiness to it from the caramel.  \n\nAnd coffee, there’s a whole lot coffee in here.  I feel like the biscuit is hiding some of the more aggressive burnt popcorn notes that tend to pop up with coffee. This leans very hard into the “dessert” part of “dessert” tobacco.\n\nWhat I’m not really getting out of this is a whole lot of tobacco.  It could just be vaping the subtle-as-a-sledgehammer absolute style decadent vapours tobaccos, but I probably wouldn’t pick out tobacco if it wasn’t called out in the description of the flavor.  The tobacco here feels like it meshes in pretty well with those coffee notes.  Really settling in, you do start to get a really light hint of ash and a little dirtiness but it’s fairly subtle and used more as an accent for those more prominent bakery and coffee notes.  I could just be looking too hard for that tobacco.  \n\n**Off-Flavors:**  Pretty light on the tobacco for something described as “a rich and soft tobacco.”\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Moderate.  This feels a bit dry to me solo.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 5%, this feels dry and a bit flat. Clear biscuit, and coffee, but it feels pretty thin without heavier caramel.\n\nAt 10%,  this is fuller and the caramel is coming through a bit more.  Not much tobacco at all, but the biscuit and coffee combo seems to be working pretty well.\n\nWhile I wouldn’t quite hit the 20% DV talks about, this feels like it does have a bit of headroom at 10%.  I’d be more likely to use it at 10% with a tobacco accent filling the rest up, but you could probably rock this solo closer to 15%.  I’d use as a bakery accent closer to 5-6%.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Seems like a dessert tobacco base.  I'd stick with nuttier or more mellow tobaccos, and maybe just crank the caramel up.  Would work really well with your RY4 of choice.\n\nMaybe still just a bit dirty to use as a non-tobacco.  Probably doable, but I'd watch for those ashy notes.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  [Decadent Vapours sells a line of pre-made juice called “Djinni” and New York 60 is one of them.  Planet of the Vapes had a review of the line posted up.  Selected notes from their review: “ I get the hints of caramel, the main vanilla and the hints of coffee, it's the biscuit that surprises me. It doesn't really taste of biscuit but instead tastes of waffles… All the ingredients balance well for me… Throat hit is mild like you'd expect from a dessert flavour… A very unique flavour that I encourage you all to try.”](https://www.planetofthevapes.co.uk/reviews/e-liquids/vapemaster_djinni.html)\n\n[I’m pretty sure this guy invents vacuums or sells that dumb looking jukebox thing in unskippable youtube ads for a day job.  But “Martyn Parker” took a look at New York 60.  He likes it though.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAptQRIKpfI)\n\n[Here’s the product page from Decadent Vapours.  Their description: “Rich and soft tobacco with flattering caramel, vanilla, biscuit and mocha tones.”  Comes complete with a bonus review from the terrifyingly named “weepapagirlrappers” who writes: “Lovely smooth well balanced tobacco and coffee flavour, neither is over powering, hints of a spice perhaps…..mixed at 20%.  Love this, a must try for coffee and tobacco lovers…easily an ADV.”](https://decadentvapours.com/shop/diy-e-liquid/flavour-concentrates/new-york-60-flavour-concentrate/)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"New York 60","url":"https://redd.it/8c6yi5","vendor":{"name":"Decadent Vapours","code":"DV"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"DV","title":"New York 60"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
