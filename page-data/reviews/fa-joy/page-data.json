Very thick mouth feel. Reminds me a lot of the freshly fried sugared donuts you get at a carnival or fair or maybe a funnel cake.\n\n**Off-flavors:** I've had reports of stale beer at higher percentages.\n\n**Throat hit:** 5/10\n\n**Uses:**  Provides a deep fried sugary sensation by adding 0.5-1% to a recipe.  2% gets a bit doughy, and at 3% and over it might get weird on you.  I use it in my [Grape Ice Cream Cone recipe](http://tjek.nu/r/62b9) at 2% without it being too much.  Certain flavorings such as INW Biscuit seem to really amplify the doughiness.  Could also work as a sweetener or substitute for EM under 0.5%\n\n**Pairings:**  Bakery type flavorings such as biscuit, cake, cookie, or donut type flavors.  Plays well with creams and chocolates also.  I can also see this working with apple, peach, or pear flavorings in a pie/cobbler type recipe.\n\n**Notes:**   I would say for the most part that is typically going to be a supporting flavor at lower percentages.  It is definitely very unique with what it adds to a recipe. It isn't bad by itself at 2% IMO, yet doesn't really carry enough of a punch to be a standalone.  This flavor is a great example of how a flavor can really change when you use too much.  Start low and adjust to your liking!  I'm going to page /u/enyawreklaw so he can maybe add something in here, as he uses it in a couple of his extremely popular recipes.\n\nEDIT: [Link to all of our flavor reviews in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)","author":"wh1skeyk1ng","title":"Joy","url":"https://redd.it/4spm5r","vendor":{"name":"Flavour Art","code":"FA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FA","title":"Joy"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
