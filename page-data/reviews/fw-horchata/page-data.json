Smooth through the nose, throat and lungs.\n\n**Flavor Properties**- Creamy, milky, vanilla, cinnamon-ish, rice pudding\n\n**Relatable Flavors** - This is just like drinking real life horchata. For those who don't know, horchata is a cinnamon-vanilla rice milk drink. At 5%, I get fairly mild notes of spices, milk and a touch of vanilla.\n\n**Off Flavors** - Nothing particularly off about it. No chemical aftertaste or smell. \n\n**Position In The Recipe** - This will work as a delicious base note. I could see people using this at about 5 or 6%, then using fruits, vanilla, creams and other spices to help bring out that realistic horchata taste. \n\n**Pairings** - Vanilla, cream, nutmeg, custard, fruits, pumpkin, coffee, the sky's the limit!\n\n**End notes** - This is a really good flavor. It's relatively sweet, creamy, milky and is the foundation of a good horchata flavor. As a standalone, I would vape it at 8% (trust me, it's really good!). As an accent, I would start around 3 - 4%.","author":"thedirtyprojector","title":"Horchata","url":"https://redd.it/4owprk","vendor":{"name":"Flavor West","code":"FW"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FW","title":"Horchata"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
