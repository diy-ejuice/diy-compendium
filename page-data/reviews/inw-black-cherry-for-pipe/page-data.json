It's not smokey like I had anticipated the \"For Pipe\" line being after trying INW Black for Pipe. The cherry is delicious (not medicinal at all) and very pronounced, with a nice deep pipe tobacco in the background. I'm no expert in tobaccos, so it'll be hard for me to liken it to a type of tobacco, but I don't get much nuttiness, just kind of a nice, deep, dry, leafy pipe tobacco. The cherry note is somewhat sweet so if you're looking for a not-so-sweet cherry tobacco vape, I would recommend using this as an accent to another tobacco to provide the cherry accent to the tobacco.\n\n**On the Nose**  \nVery Cherry forward, slight tobacco essence\n\n**Recommended Usage**  \n*Stand alone*: 2-3%\n\n*In a mix*: 1-2%.  \n\n**Throat**  \nMild, thumpy, not sharp or scratchy/dry\n\n**Pairings**  \nCherry, dark fruits, coffee, other tobaccos. \n\n**Avoid**  \nNot too sure here, probably brighter fruits and creams.\n\n**Steep**  \n2-3 Weeks. Tobacco becomes much more pronounced and \"full\" after a steep.  \n\n**Recipe Ideas**  \n\nHonestly this concentrate is really great on its own. When using this in a recipe it will most likely be to bring a cherry note to tobaccos  \n\n*Please if your opinion differs, or you have another review for this post it in the comments. Will help the master list with multiple reviews in one spot.*","author":"CheebaSteeba","title":"Black Cherry for Pipe","url":"https://redd.it/4uh7oe","vendor":{"name":"Inawera","code":"INW"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"INW","title":"Black Cherry for Pipe"}},
