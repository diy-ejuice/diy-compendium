Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FW Star Candy, 2 and 4%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 5 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  The taste of starbursts, if not the texture. A mixed fruit flavor, seems to be based on the classic orange, lemon, cherry, and strawberry starburst lineup.  Solid candy sweetness, with a really interesting tart note.  Seems a bit heavy on the citrus, but there may be more strawberry hiding in here that I can't really taste.  No real starburst texture to this, just kind of syrupy. Sort of like jamming all 4 colors of starbursts in your mouth and just letting them dissolve as opposed to chewing them.  Fairly accurate flavor though.  Seems like a good starting point for your candy vapes.  I'd use this as a primary note around 6%.\n\nInhale is tart and candy citrus heavy. Definitely tastes like the yellow and orange starbursts. Candy sweetness, but a syrupy as opposed to chewy texture. A little harsh and sharp, but that tartness seems dead on to profile. Exhale is has tart lemon right up front with that sweeter orange coming in right after it.  Some higher citrus top notes, but nothing like a citrus zest. Exhale starts to pick up some nuance on the back half as the red and the pink starburst flavor starts to show up. Supposed to be a cherry and strawberry, but just tastes accurately indistinct and \"red.\" No artificial cherry weirdness. Still syrupy sweet as opposed to chewy.  Lingering sugar lips and a bit of rawness from that heavy tart note.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Texture is pretty from starburst, but nothing off in the flavors.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Moderate. That tartness is a bit harsh overall.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Fairly accurate to all of the classic starbursts at least in flavor, just needs some texture.  This should take candy texturizers pretty well. Seems like some CAP Jelly Candy or a small percentage of FLV Candy Roll and some Vanilla Swirl should probably work for some starburstish texture.\n\nThis also tastes fairly close to the artificial fruit mix in skittles, although it would probably need some extra lime and grape to really fill out the whole rainbow.\n\nAlternatively they have those bizarre taco bell starburst slushies. You could totally do that.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, this seems pretty linear. Noticeable down at 2%, but seems a little light and pretty far towards lemon. 4% is quite a bit sweeter, with a little more nuance in that citrus.  Orange is quite a bit clearer here.  The red and pink starburst taste is more of an accent to the citrus. At 6% this feels pretty well balanced. It's pretty strongly sweet and tart, but that seems accurate to profile.  A bit on the harsh side, but the flavor underneath the harshness isn't bad. At 8% that harshness is getting to be a bit much, and the tartness is tasting a little acidic.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nBrand New!\n\n[Here is the product page.  It is not useful. Worth noting FW doesn't have a SDS up for this yet, so no firm indication if there is anything weird like sugar syrup in here.  But hey, it looks like they have already changed the name from \"Star Candy\" to \"Starburst Type,\" so that's fun.](http://flavorwest.com/index.php/water-soluble-flavoring/starburst-type.html)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**\n\n[Bonus video first test for this, FW Big Stick, and FW Sprinkles.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvX1V5-8BD0)","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Star Candy","url":"https://redd.it/6p6ftn","vendor":{"name":"Flavor West","code":"FW"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FW","title":"Star Candy"}},
