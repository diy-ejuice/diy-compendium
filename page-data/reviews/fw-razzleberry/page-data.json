It's got a beginning, middle and end though.     \n**Throat hit:**  3.5/5    \n**Relatable Flavors:** Bottle caps candy. Razzles. The candy that turns into a gum.     \n**Uses:** Candy mixes. It's really not bad stand alone. It's not something I'd want to drop into a natural fruit flavor mix though.     \n**Notes:** Neat flavor. A novelty.It's a stand alone candy flavor that has a few things going on all at once. Nothing wrong with it at all. For what it is.     \n**Rating:** 4/5    ","author":"TexasHex","title":"Razzleberry","url":"https://redd.it/4o5ruz","vendor":{"name":"Flavor West","code":"FW"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FW","title":"Razzleberry"}},
