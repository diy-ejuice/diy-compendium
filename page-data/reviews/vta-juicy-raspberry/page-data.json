Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Vape Train Juicy Raspberry, 3% and 7%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 14 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  A floral raspberry with some juicy tendencies.\n\nFloral heavy raspberry.  Typical perfume-type berry floral all up in the top notes.  Florals stick around throughout the entire vape and end up being very prominent in the exhale.  More floral than the top end of something like FA Raspberry, but less floral than FA Blackberry… so that’s something.   \n\nThe floral here is a bummer, because the raspberry underneath it is pretty solid.  Moderately dense, with a deeply juicy base.  Full, realistic raspberry flavor.  Maybe a bit sweeter than a straight raspberry, but doesn’t feel too candied or artificial. Nice balance of tarter brightness and deeper sweet berry notes.  Feels very vivid and red.\n\nMouthfeel overall is juicy in the base, especially on the inhale, but dries out from those florals up top.  \n\n**Off-Flavors:**  Pretty solidly floral and perfumey.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Moderate. The body of the flavor is pretty mellow, but those florals get a bit harsh.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 3%,  the florals here are still pretty intense.  Raspberry is moderately juicy, but seems a bit undersaturated.  What I can taste of the raspberry here is fairly realistic, but seems a bit lost.\n\nAt 7%,  that’s a really aggressive floral.  Raspberry is sweet and bright, with a juicier base.  But yeah, floral.\n\nVape Train suggests mixing between 1-3% and standalone from 3-5% so I’m guessing someone noticed the floral thing.  Just based on these tests, I’d be going lower with this as an accent, somewhere between 1-2%.  Cutting back one of my testers to about 1%, that floral is still there but not completely overwhelming, and some of that juicier mouthfeel is still coming through.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This one might be a bit tricky to get right.  There is a decent, juicy raspberry here but it’s a bit swamped by those florals.  My best guess would be trying to use this underneath a brighter, candied berry flavor to add some juiciness and realism.   I’d pick something like FW Razzleberry, FLV Boysenberry, or TPA Sweet Raspberry.  Anything that already has a floral note is going to be difficult to make worth with this.\n\nAlternatively, this could be used in fruit mixes at that same accent percentage to add a hint of raspberry.  Again, big bright fruit flavors without floral notes are going to be you’re friend.  I’d look at guava, kiwi, or strawberry.\n\nCooling can help clean up floral notes a little bit, so a colder mix would probably be better.  Florals also  hide a bit when introduced to aggressive alcohol flavors, so maybe throw it in a cocktail? Should do a decent job of a muddled raspberry.\n\nToo floral to really recommend with creams, custards, or bakeries.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  I’m not really seeing anything out there via google.\n\n[No description, but here is the product page from Vape Train.](https://www.vapetrain.com.au/shop/vt-concentrates/juicy-raspberry-flavour-concentrate-diy-for-e-liquid-recipe/)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Juicy Raspberry","url":"https://redd.it/8ess1s","vendor":{"name":"Vape Train Australia","code":"VTA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"VTA","title":"Juicy Raspberry"}},
