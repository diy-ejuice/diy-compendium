    "result": {"data":{"reviewsJson":{"markdown":"**Setup:** Narda Clone, Single coil  26g Kanthal @.7 ohms.  25W Power, Half wicked with Native Wicks Platinum Blend\n\n**Testing:** FW Caramel Cinnamon Roll @ 5%. 70/30 VG/PG, steeped 9 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Sweet Caramel roll with a touch of cinnamon. It has a nice fluffy bakery element with a nice thick mouth feel. This flavor is heavy on the caramel and bakery and light on the cinnamon. The caramel that is used is very smooth and rich, sort of like their salted caramel. \n\n**Off-flavors:**  Not a one\n\n**Throat Hit:**  It is just a tiny bit stingy on the throat, probably because of the cinnamon.\n\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I would use this in bakeries where you want a nice sweet caramel and the cinnamon won't clash. The obvious use would be when making a caramel cinnamon roll or pecan roll. I can see this being good in custards and creams as well if you don't mind that bit of cinnamon. \n\n\n**Notes:**\nI really like this flavor. Caramel and cinnamon are actually a pretty good combo. It isn't a super versatile flavor and you could probably get the same result with a few ingredients like Cap cds and fw salted caramel but its nice.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Not much in the way of ELR Notes](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/16604).\n\n[Here is a tasty recipe](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/21634#caramel_cinnamon_roll_ice_cream_cheesecake_by_thadentman) by /u/thadentman. \n\n[People seem to like it on BCF](http://www.bullcityflavors.com/caramel-cinnamon-roll-fw/)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**\n\nIf you have different opinions on the flavor or any ideas on how to use it please post them in the comments.
