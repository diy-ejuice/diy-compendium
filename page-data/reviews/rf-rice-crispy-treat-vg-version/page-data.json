All I get from it is an offensive grainy almost rice krispie taste with a background of sweetness. I can't taste past that to detect any butter or actual marshmallow flavor. It's the same grainy grossness I get with FW Rice Crispy. However, I think that's my sensitivity and therefore it's not fair for me to judge this flavor. I had my husband taste it to see what he gets, and he actually likes it and says it's quite good. He said it tastes like a crispy treat to him, and he can taste the marshmallow and butter from it. I gave him the rest of the tester.","author":"mysticrosell","title":"Rice Crispy Treat VG Version","url":"https://redd.it/55sgxv","vendor":{"name":"Real Flavors","code":"RF"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"RF","title":"Rice Crispy Treat VG Version"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
