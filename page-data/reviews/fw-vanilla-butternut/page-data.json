The vanilla is smooth and vibrant, with the addition of the butternut maple flavor, it becomes complex, rich, and savory.\n\n**Relatable Flavors** \n\nReminds me of true maple syrup with a touch of vanilla a very surprising find not what I was expecting at all.\n\n**Position In The Recipe** \n\nAccent- I use for this flavoring accent In other sweet notes and adding that hint of maple.\n\nBase- if I was going for a purely maple flavor I believe this would be a great base note.\n\nTop note- I think this is where this flavoring really shines the impression of maple is the first thing I taste when I put it in any recipe.\n\n**Off flavers**\n\nI've yet to find anything off about the flavoring other than the name is misleading I am getting no squash pumpkin flavoring from it at all.\n\n**Pairings** \n\nBakeries, creams, candies, tropical fruits, stone fruits, dark berries, and spice flavorings.\n\n**Recipe**\n\nThis is going to be an attempt at maple butter still a work in progress feel free to leave feedback.\n\n https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/share/cc8e4a1d-72eb-4b58-9c96-488671194cb5\n\n**Notes** \n\nI have been using this as a high percentage found my sweet spot between 4 and 6% and have not tested to see if flavor changes at lower percentage.\n\nIf you're interested in learning more about maple and why the hell we like tree sap so much here is a Wikipedia.\n\n https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maple_syrup\n\nAnd this is where I got mine\n\n http://www.bullcityvapor.com/vanilla-butternut-fw/\n\n**Rating** 95/100\n\n**Please if your opinion differs, or you have another review for this flavor add it in the comments.
