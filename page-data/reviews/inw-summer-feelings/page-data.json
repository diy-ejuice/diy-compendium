IN VAPING^TM\n\n\nInawerawinkel's description:\n\nNew\nSweet, fruity with complementary aromas of raspberry and peach with a slight addition of lime. Taste of summer full of delicious fruit flavors.\n[The label \"art\" - **PREPARE TO BE INSPIRED**!!](http://imgur.com/a/3sCle).\n===================================\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Specs:**\n\n- percentage used: 4%\n- overnight steep\n- PG/VG ratio: 50/50\n- vaped on Nautilus mini \n- 1.8 ohm coil\n- 11.1 Watts\n&nbsp;\n\n**Flavour Properties:**\n\n- Tart\n- Tangy\n- slight \"floral\" topnote (which can be tamed)\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Relatable Flavours:**\n\n- thin peach flavour,   \n- tart Inawera raspberry, way back in the mix,  \n- light touch of naturalistic lime.\n- there's something of a Sharon Fruit \"bite\" about it.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Mouth Feel:**\n\n- Thin, tart.  \n- Mildly adstringent  sensation.  \n- Moderately sweet.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavours:**\n\n- Floral top note might be scary for some.\n- could probably get a bit chemically with too much over 4%.\n- I personally find it a bit on the dry side, will try with\nCactus / Dragonfruit\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Position In A Recipe:**\n\n- this immediately comes across as mid to top kind of flavour, but I've found it to fill a main role too.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Suggested Percentage:**\n\n- 4, or less, to add character, or adstringency to fruits that are too \"one dimensional\" or candy-like\n&nbsp;\n\n**Pairings:**\n\n- Menthol\n- Koolada\n- WS-23\n- Reinforcement for Peach, add depth to sweet Apricot, Plum\n- add a tang to Raspberry/ Strawberry mixes\n- give a tartness to fruit toppings on cakes, tarts, turnovers.\n- add depth to teas, lemonades.\n- Add bite to hard candies\n&nbsp;\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- Interesting starting point for Sorbets, fruit, drinks, deserts.\n- also for those who want to like Juicy Peach, but can't.\n\n- Foresee myself mostly using this in the cold/fruity side of things,\n- as an antidote to the tobaccos I've been enjoying\n\n- Is this a keeper?\nfor me yes, still playing with it, learning from the balance in the mix.\nIn the same way that cloning a juice can be a good reverse-engineering exercise ;  \n\nCombinations such as these, teach us what can be achieved with just three concentrates.\n\nI'll usually throw a few \"wild card\" flavours in the cart, when ordering from Inawera, rarely regret it.\n\nI am curious to see what directions others take it to!\n*edited \"for sanity\" might add as I get to know it better.  \n\nthanks to u/wh1skeyk1ng for formatting tips.","author":"keed_spills","title":"Summer Feelings","url":"https://redd.it/5ro6v7","vendor":{"name":"Inawera","code":"INW"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"INW","title":"Summer Feelings"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
