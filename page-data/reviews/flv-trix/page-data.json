I get grainy notes with lemon and generic berry type flavor.  This definitely sets itself apart from other fruity cereals like fruit rings and fruity flakes. It is slightly sweet and dry.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Very authentic flavor, nothing there that doesn't add to the profile.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Moderate throat hit probably due to the dryness of the flavor as well as the citrus.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This flavor is ready for your favorite milk stone to make a perfect bowl of Trix. It is a very well rounded and balanced flavor that doesn't need much help. Maybe you can go crazy and make a trix donut or something. \n\n**Notes:**\nThis is one circumstance where the lemon flavor actually comes out with a steep. It doesn't overpower the other flavors, you can still taste a generic berry flavor like the red and purple trix. It has a good balance that helps sell that authenticity;\n\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**\n\nIf you have different opinions on the flavor or any ideas on how to use it please post them in the comments.
