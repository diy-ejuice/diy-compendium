Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** DIYFS Mr. Good Stuff @ 3%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 25 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** A really solid vanilla whipped cream with a caramel backend. Overall light on dairy but super fluffy.  A very commercial whip cream bordering on a richer kool-whip with a strong neutral vanilla flavor and a caramel sauce towards the end of the exhale.\n\nInhale is mostly a warm dense sweetness with some clean vanilla. Definite sweetener edge there. Exhale starts on a really fluffy, slightly dry vanilla. Actual vanilla flavor is pretty neutral, bordering on a bit too clean and artificial.  No real dairy there, but definitely tastes whipped and fluffy.   Soft, blonde caramel notes later in the exhale without much fatty richness. Overall effect is like a caramel sauce. Lingering caramel and sweetener bitterness. Overall fairly dense, and definitely sweet.\n\n**Off-flavors:** So, there is some kind of added sweetener in here. Or, alternatively, there isn't and i'm beyond impressed. I get a bit of aspartame-y sucralose throughout then entire vape.\n\n**Throat Hit:** None that I tell.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This is good as a stand-alone. Definitely on the sweet side, but pretty well balanced.\n\nMixing this, I'd stay away from sweeter or candy fruits unless you want an overbearing style of sweetness.  Personally, I'd use this as an opportunity to bring in some tarter flavors or maybe even some citrus.  Pineapple, Cranberry, Raspberry, Blackcurrant, or Blood Orange would all take advantage of the sweetness here without pushing into cloying.\n\nI can also see use in bakeries, especially those aimed at replicating more of a commercial juice. Use it like a amped up whip cream and you could use a grainier pastry base involving FA Cookie or INW Biscuit.\n\nShould provide an interesting counterpoint to more realistic nut flavors. I'd avoid creams or custards, just because I feel like that sweetness might be an issue. Or don't avoid them, and get ready for a stronger ice cream or milkshake base.  Some eggyness or dairy may help push this into a more realistic flavor, so something like FA Fresh Cream or INW Creme Brulee.\n\nThis will take any tobacco squarely into a fluffy RY4 territory.\n\nAlso, this makes a hell of a flavor for adding to coffee. So maybe a darker roasted espresso flavor like FA Dark Bean or even a dark chocolate flavor like HS Australian Chocolate or FA Cocoa.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nS&V concentration testing, at 1% I get a slightly bitter vanilla extract type of flavor. Not a whole lot of caramel that low. 2% wakes up that caramel a bit, and gives quite a bit more richness on the exhale.  Almost a bit of a marzipan note as the vanilla is present but not all that fluffy. 3% gives some serious body to vanilla and some additional caramel. 4% seems a bit too much, and the sweetness gets too pronounced to be pleasant and reads fairly bitter. I'd mix this at 2% and run it solo or as a strong primary favor at 3%.\n\nI got this as a free sample in my order for Holy Vanilla and decided what the hell, I'll test it out.  I'm really enjoying it as a one-shot. It's a good bordering on great flavor, I just don't see myself using it much beyond that because it's not really what I'm after in a concentrate. I'm not a fan of having the sweetness predetermined for me here, although it is damn tasty as presented.  Little bit of sticker shock at $10 an ounce, but Flavorah is actually above that price point on even their cheap concentrates and plenty of INW goes for $4.49 for 10ml. The price could be an issue, although this works perfectly fine as a one-shot at 3% so the value is definitely there.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nNot a whole lot I can find.\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Mr. Good Stuff","url":"https://redd.it/5kvy7n","vendor":{"name":"DIY Flavor Shack","code":"DIYFS"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"DIYFS","title":"Mr. Good Stuff"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
