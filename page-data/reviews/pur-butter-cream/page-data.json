Naturally sweet similar to sweet cream butter, not a butter cream frosting. Butter flavor is dominant and very authentic, nothing artificial and definitely not like margarine. At a 2 week steep, the butter flavor has smoothed out just slightly with a longer steep into a more balanced butter with cream, the butter is not quite as dominant as when freshly mixed. It still a lovely creamy butter flavor, sweet and natural tasting. It has more of a rich fluffy whipped type mouth feel/body with the longer steep. This could easily be used as a dense rich butter flavor in the first few days, but it developed into a good whipped and fluffy butter cream with the additional steep time. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:** None\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit:** 0/10\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Pairings:** Almost any fruit you like with cream especially berries, try to avoid citrus and acidic fruits. Cookies, cakes, cereal, creams, nuts, tobaccos, bagels, cookies, cakes, pie crusts, custards, pastries. Anywhere you want butter.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Notes:** I was worried a little bit about it being too delicate to hold up to stronger flavors. It still needs more testing to see what it will provide to a variety of flavors. However, I did mix 2.5mls of the 6% tester with 2.5mls of pre-steeped Elephant Ear, and it's a delicious buttery frosted pastry with an amazing body.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Comparison:** CAP Butter Cream is a little less sweet and also has great body and a creamy mouth feel. It's butter flavor is more artificially flavored than PUR's and also has a faint astringent chemical note that does steep out when used in low percentages. CAP's is more of a cream with the butter being a lighter back note vs PUR's which is more of a sweet butter with the cream being the lighter back note. I personally prefer the flavor of PUR as the butter is authentic and more prominent, without having any chemical off flavors. However, I also think there are recipes where CAP's will work better, it's all dependent on the flavor profile you are seeking to create.\n\nThis is not a SF candidate for my tastes. I recommend 1-3% as an accent flavor.
