I wouldn't call this a strictly floral concentrate or just a blackberry, but both elements are present. at 1% the berry isn't overpoweringly strong or sickly sweet but calls to mind blackberry jam or syrup. this is definitely a great flavor with nothing off about it! I would recommend this to fruit and floral lovers alike.\n\n**Off-flavors:** nothing that isn't in the name!\n\n**Throat Hit:** smooth even as a shake and vape.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:** range of use is probably 0.5% for adding a background sweet floral note to a fruit blend to 2% for solo use. you could pair this with bakeries/ ice creams as a kind of blackberry syrup drizzle. this flavor would fit really well in creams or fruits without feeling out of place. this would also play nicely with other floral flavors (id want to try this in some remix of Longing!)\n\n**Notes & Second Opinions:** Nothing else out there right now, but please share your thoughts if you have this!","author":"PerennialPhilosopher","title":"Blackberry Blossom","url":"https://redd.it/6x0jys","vendor":{"name":"Flavorah","code":"FLV"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FLV","title":"Blackberry Blossom"}},
