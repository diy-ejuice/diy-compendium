It is fairly sour or bitter tasting. My palate is not refined enough to be able to distinguish what kind of nuts I am tasting but it is not peanuts. I am quite honestly having a tough time describing this flavor. I really hope I can get some help in the comments. It is very powerful tasting with just a hint of chocolate note in the background.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  The whole thing tastes off to me, I was expecting a chocolate flavor and instead I get this strong, nutty note.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  This flavor is moderately harsh on its own due to its dryness.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I got this flavor solely for [Minty down Under v2](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/18731) by /u/rageisalotofwork. Otherwise I would use this maybe in sunday type mixes where you want some nuts as well as a touch of chocolate, it will also bolster the ice cream as this flavor is quite creamy. It would also be good in a milkshake where that nuttiness would bring a malty affect to your ice cream. \n\n**Notes:**\nI haven't quite decided if I like this flavor or not lol. I think I need to mix with it more but it is very strange to me. I get way more chocolate in inw chocolate cream which also has a nice nutty taste. I am going to find it hard to come up with uses for this.\n\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**\n\nIf you have different opinions on the flavor or any ideas on how to use it please post them in the comments.
