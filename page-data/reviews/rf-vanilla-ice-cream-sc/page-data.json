Our premium Vanilla Ice Cream is the perfect after-dinner dessert…or pre-dinner indulgence for those who can’t resist.\n\n**Flavor description**: Right off the first pull you get a get a very strong sweet vanilla flavor. A slight cream flavor comes out on the exhale. Barely noticeable though. No where near TFA VBIC. You do get a incredibly sweeter vanilla flavor than the TFA variant but at 2% this isn't very strong. Tastes like a background note here. This does lack all of the body that the TFA version does bring. That is definitely from the lack of Diacetyl and Acetoin in this flavor. This flavor honestly tastes like a fat free vanilla ice cream. It will kill your craving but it doesn't make you hate yourself after eating it. The flavor suffers from the same sort of \"flatness\" that concreteriver has talked about in his reviews. It doesn't feel like this a full flavor. The flavor feels incomplete compared to what is on the market.\n\n**Off Flavors**: Nothing of note; no black pepper\n\n**Throat Hit**: Nothing; Really smooth\n\n**Uses**: It would be a shorter list to index all the profiles this wouldn't fit. Everyone here is well aware of what this flavor goes well with. Considering the lack of body I would use this flavor for a sweet vanilla note boosting a ice cream profile. Or just a vanilla flavor in general. I honestly wouldn't recommend this over the other flagship vanilla flavors like DIYFS Holy Vanilla or INW Shisha Vanilla. This would fit a niche sweet vanilla use.\n\n**Rating**: This isn't a TFA VBIC replacement IMO. This doesn't check nearly enough boxes to even pass off a suitable substitute. This does, however, bring a nice sweet vanilla flavor, but other vanilla flavors fill the profile better than this does. 5/10\n\n**Second Opinions**: Nothing really on the SC version of this flavor; just the VG version.\n\n**[Real Flavors VG version review](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/5n3w5k/rf_vanilla_ice_cream_vg_version/) by /u/mysticrosell**\n\n> **Percentage Used:** 12%\n\n> **Equipment Used:** Troll RDA with a SS Dragon Nano coil .46ohm at 25W\n\n> **PG/VG:** 30/70\n\n> **Steep Time:** 4 Weeks\n\n> **Aroma:** Vanilla, cream, sugar.\n\n> **Flavor Description:** Thick and creamy pure vanilla ice cream. I couldn’t detect any sharpness or peppery tones of vanilla bean. Moderately sweet, although I’m not sure how much of that is from the flavoring or the VG it’s suspended in. It’s probably from a combination of both. This has a creamy mouth feel with a slight thickness on the tongue. This is such a well rounded vanilla, it would be wonderful used in any recipe where you are looking for sweet creamy vanilla. The ice cream aspect is light enough that it might be hidden behind other flavors in a mix, just leaving the thick creamy vanilla.\n\n> **Off Flavors:** None\n\n> **Throat Hit:** 2/10\n\n> **Pairings:** Almost any fruit, particularly berries or for fruit smoothies or cocktails. Cookies, cakes, creams, custards, nuts, tobaccos, pies, cinnamon, butter pecan, caramel, butterscotch, mint, chocolate chip, creme de menthe, any ice cream combination, Koolada or menthol. Anywhere you want creamy vanilla.\n\n> **Notes:** Good moderate strength at 12% for a SF. If you like a more in your face flavor I would go for 15-17% SF. I will have to experiment with it in mixes, I’ll probably start around 3-8%. A very versatile flavor with a lot of uses. Based on my other testing of RF flavors, I’m sure the thickness and creaminess will continue to develop, usually with the best results at 8 weeks or more. \n\n\n","author":"chewymidget","title":"Vanilla Ice Cream SC","url":"https://redd.it/6hvle5","vendor":{"name":"Real Flavors","code":"RF"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"RF","title":"Vanilla Ice Cream SC"}},
