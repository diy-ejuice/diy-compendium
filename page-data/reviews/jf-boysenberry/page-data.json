Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** JF Boysenberry @ 3%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 16 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Bright berry with peach at lower percentages. Good sweetness without a whole lot of juice. Berry note tastes like a mix of blackcurrant and raspberry.\n\nInhale is light fragrant peach. Exhale still has that peach note, but the berry is underneath that. Berry itself is lighter, and just a bit tart.  Light, almost natural tasting sweetness with a fairly thin and dry body.  The tail end of the exhale is mostly green underripe peach and just a hint of caramel.  Little bit of a sticky mouth feel with prolonged use.\n\n**Off-flavors:** At higher percentages especially, tastes a fair bit like underripe peaches.  Not bad, but a little weird.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Light, little bit of throat tightness.  Ramps up a bit at higher percentage.  Nothing out of line for a fruit.  The peach note makes me think it would be something to watch for varying sensitivities.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Fruit mixes. That brightness is going to mix well maybe one other bright fruit and other jammier, darker fruits.\nYou could exploit that peach note by adding something in to boost it like JF Honey Peach, FLV Peach or FLV Mango.  If you wanted to push the berries, FLV Boysenberry, TFA Sweet Raspberry, FA Blackcurrant, or FA Raspberry.\n\nI'm just spitballing here, but the berry and peach kind of reminds me of a fancy belini, so maybe FW Pink Champagne.\n\nThat green note is pretty subtle, so it should blend well with creams.  Punchy enough for bakeries, although the peach in here will get a bit confusing.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nS&V concentration testing, this seems to be best under 1%.  That peach is relatively balanced with berry and isn't floral or perfumey.  Any higher than that and the peach muscles in quite a bit more.  2% is still nice and non-floral, but that peach is right up front.  Anything above that seems like overkill and gets floral and too green.  I'd mix at 1% if you're avoiding a clear peach and 2% if that's what you're going for, man.\n\nSo I thought I had screwed up and mixed this tester up with JF Honey Peach.  I did not, they are definitely different.  The peach note is a bit of a mystery for me, but with that said it's not bad but just unexpected.  Unless they have somehow mislabelled my actual bottle of concentrate, which I guess is an option.  Or, alternatively I'm completely wrong and my taste buds are broken.\n\nJungle flavors seems to target specific concentrates, so I also mixed up some FLV Boysenberry thinking that they were trying to aim for that. It's radically different. FLV has a much stronger sweet berry note with a jammier, syrup taste.\n\nPerfectly fine flavor, just a bit mislabelled as far I can tell.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nYeah, not really.  [One note on ELR saying it tastes like boysenberry syrup.  Based on my bottle, this appears to be wrong.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/25506)\n\nQuick mention on Vaping Underground.
