Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Watermelon@ %.5 and 1.5%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 19 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** A soft, lightly artificial watermelon flavor. Should work to add some sweetness and volume to a mix when used as an accent. The flesh part of the watermelon is a little artificial, with a slight perfumey edge that comes out at higher percentages. Realistic rind note, more of that white fragrant part of the rind as opposed to the actual skin of the melon.\n\nFairly dense inhale, with a sharper, floral watermelon flavor.  A little warm, with a moderate level of sweetness. Exhale is much softer than the inhale, with that candy watermelon flesh up front and more realistic white rind top notes. Still pretty dense, especially considering the lower percentage used.  Doesn't seem particularly juicy, but it gets a bit mouth-watering, which is cool. Sweetness tastes a little artificial, but not super overwhelming.  Gets floral above 1% though, with the exhale getting some of the same sharpness as the inhale.  Lingering rind note.\n\n**Off Flavors:** Used low, the flesh of the watermelon tastes a little artificial.  Probably not the worst thing, considering real watermelon is pretty subtle and easy to lose in a mix.  Used above 1%, the floral edge really starts to come out and that artificial watermelon flavor gets an artificial sweetener note.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Used at .5%, not really. Starts to pick up a throat hit at 1% and is pretty pronounced by 2%.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Good for some fairly realistic watermelon background noise at .5%.  Popping this in a fruit mix to add depth to brighter flavors in the forefront seems like the best bet. Comparable usage to FA Watermelon in that way.\n\nI don't think this is a good watermelon to try to push to the front of recipes as a primary note. Increasing percentage to try to push the flavor to the front gives you a clear perfumey edge.  Real watermelon is pretty subtle, and I think if you want it up front you'll want a brighter, cleaner watermelon candy flavor.\n\n**Notes:**  S&V concentration testing, this is way better down low. .25% seems a bit weak, but by .5% I get a really nice watermelon accent. A little bit candy, but nice, round, and sweet. It's not an aggressive flavor by any means, but it'll work really well as an accent that low.  At 1%, you get a bit of harshness and a slightly sharper candy flavor that kind of tastes like the rind of a watermelon. At 1.5% this is starting to get a bit bitter and sharp. 2% is sweet but a little rough, a candy watermelon flavor with a floral edge.  At 3% this is definitely a candy watermelon. The perfumey edge will steep down a bit, but you've still got a fair bit of harshness. Above 3%, this just seems like a bad candy watermelon. I'd suggest using this an accent flavor at .5%, maybe working up to 1% if you want some candy in there and can deal with a bit of a throat hit.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Some information on ELR. Seems to be leaning toward higher %'s with this because it's a softer flavor.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/33046)\n\n[Jbird has a watermelon bubble gum recipe on ATF using this with some Wild Melon and Canteloupe backup.  \"FLV Watermelon - This is a good candy watermelon. Although, you can taste a little bit of the white part (rind) which I wasn't expecting from a candied flavor. It lends a hand at making the recipe a bit more juicy too.\"](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/35898#honeymelon_bubble_gum_by_jbird)\n\n[/u/Eein/ describes FLV Watermelon in a watermelon thread: \"I really like FLV watermelon - it has a juicy organic rind smell (that i noticed doesn't transfer) and when mixed solo or with a couple drops of koolada tastes like a wet jolly rancher; not overpowering though. You might be able to dilute it and get a more natural taste.\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/3pu5mt/best_watermelon/)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Watermelon","url":"https://redd.it/61x2ht","vendor":{"name":"Flavorah","code":"FLV"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FLV","title":"Watermelon"}},
