    "result": {"data":{"reviewsJson":{"markdown":"**Setup:** Plume Veil RDA; dual parallel @ .40Î©; cotton wicks; 50W\n\n**Testing:** CAP NY Cheesecake @ 4%; Aged: 16 days\n\n**Flavor description:**  Thick, wet, creamy, sugary cream cheese taste, but not overly cheesy at 4%.  Also has subtle notes of vanilla and butter.  \n\n**Off-flavors:** Some people reported gym socks, cardboard, or stinky cheese. I do not personally taste any of this at 4%, may be possible to obtain these tastes at higher percentages.\n\n**Throat hit:** 3/10 fairly smooth\n\n**Uses:**  Part of a cream base, the obvious cheesecake recipe, desserts.  Great \"thickener\".\n\n**Pairings:** Graham cracker, other creams, preferred fruits, custards, cinnamon, and mostly any vanilla flavoring.\n\n**Notes:**   This flavor may require some time (2-3 weeks) to age before it reaches full potential.  I consider it to be a fairly versatile flavoring as it easily plays into many different recipes.\n\nEDIT: [Link to all of our flavor reviews in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)\n","author":"wh1skeyk1ng","title":"New York Cheesecake","url":"https://redd.it/4s6pjh","vendor":{"name":"Capella","code":"CAP"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"CAP","title":"New York Cheesecake"}},
