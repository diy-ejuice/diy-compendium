Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Cinnamon Roll @ 1% and 1 drop per 10ml, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 11 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Another mystifying Flavorah bakery that doesn't have a whole lot of bakery in there right out of the gate.  I'm getting a clear cinnamon that's not quite as robust as straight FLV Rich Cinnamon and has a bit of lighter, spicier note without that heavy body.  There's also a touch of an icing note, mostly an errant sweetness.  But there is no real bread to this flavor, and it seems to be lacking body all around.\n\nInhale is mostly high, spicy cinnamon notes with a dense neutral body. Some sweetness, but nothing reads as cinnamon roll levels.  Exhale is again, mostly cinnamon and a dense, kind of plain volume. Cinnamon up front and the top notes, not quite the body of Rich Cinnamon, more like flavorah's fire cinnamon or spicier version of FA Cinnamon Ceylon. Lots of fairly dense volume, but there's not a lot of flavor here.  Some light bready notes, but you really can't call it a cinnamon roll taste.  Base sweetness, but not icing sweet.  Mouthfeel is a bit heavy and grainy, just missing an actual bread flavor.\n \n**Off-flavors:**  More from what isn't here.  I don't get much, if any, bread or dough, and that icing note could easily just be the base sweetness of the concentrate.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  The cinnamon here is a bit spicy, but not classically harsh.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Seems like another bridge flavor from flavorah, where they're just giving you a thinner sketch of a flavor and they want to build around it. Plenty of cinnamon, but for a cinnamon roll you are going to need the actual roll, and probably some sort of icing. Testing this S&V with .25% AP, you can get some of those bready, fuller notes back, but then you are having to use a fairly heavy hand to get a frosting to show through here.\n\nIf you don't want to use this to build a cinnamon roll, this may have some use as a bakery cinnamon addtive.  It's less intense than Rich Cinnamon, but it does have a good, strong spicy note and some heavier mouthfeel and sweetness that would fit into apple pies, coffee cakes, and bread pudding.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, the cinnamon is going to be the limiting factor. At .25%, I get a clear cinnamon and not a whole lot else. Decent volume, but no strong flavor to it. .5% doesn't take markedly different from .5%, maybe a bit stronger cinnamon.  1% has a pretty up-front bakery cinnamon, denser volume, but still no bread to be found.  1.5% is pretty bold on the cinnamon front, definitely on the spicy side.  Good volume, and I'm getting just a touch of breadyness but the volume here is starting to get a bit cardboardy.  2% is my usuable limit here. Cinnamon is still getting just a bit too intense.  Whether using this build a cinnamon roll, or a bakery cinnamon additive, this is an accent flavor all the way.  I'd recommend starting with this at .5% for a bakery cinnamon additive, and 1.25% to hang all the cinnamon roll flavors off of.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[One note on ELR by user Brian_SFL:](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/112174) \n\n\"astonishingly accurate cin roll under 2%;FLV rich cinnamon flavor is built in. Less is more, consider a super-concentrate. .4 - 1% should be enough in mixes, and for me no other cinnamon ingredients are needed/wanted when using this.\nTop shelf.\n\nI can't say I agree, but maybe I'm just not picking up the bread here.\n\n\n\n[Heres the Flavorah product page.  Their description: \"Cinnamon roll bready and buttered, but this one wonâ€™t make you fat. It is a canvas for adding more, like frosting, cinamon or more dough. Very useful as a base cinnamon bakery flavor. \"](http://store.flavorah.com/concentrated-cinnamon-roll-flavor)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Cinnamon Roll","url":"https://redd.it/66re2k","vendor":{"name":"Flavorah","code":"FLV"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FLV","title":"Cinnamon Roll"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
