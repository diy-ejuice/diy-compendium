    "result": {"data":{"reviewsJson":{"markdown":"**Setup:** Berserker MTL RTA, 7/8 wrap 28 gauge kanthal, 2mm ID, 1.42 ohms, 12 watts, organic cotton\n\n**Testing:** 5%, 50/50, 10mg/mL nicotine, shake and vape\n\n**Flavor Description:** It’s exactly what the name describes, a sweet, ripe black currant. This is what I imagine macerating ripe currants in sugar and drinking the liquid at the bottom of the vessel would taste like. There’s enough natural fruit character to keep this from being what I would consider a candy flavor. \n\n**Off Flavors:** None. \n\n**Mouthfeel:** I usually add a touch of Inawera Cactus to my fruit recipes, but I don’t think Sweet Currant needs it. It’s got an inherent juiciness as a solo flavor. Also, no sweetener is required, at least not for me. \n\n**Throat Hit:** None. \n\n**Uses:** Since it’s such a realistic flavor, I could see this being an awesomely me pairing with pie and other bakery recipes. Pairing it with other fruits, especially citrus, seems like another obvious choice. \n\n**Conclusion:** This is a 10/10 for me. It’s so realistic that I’d be more than happy to vape it exclusively as a solo flavor mix. That said, I’m really looking forward to mixing it with some other stuff to see how it behaves.","author":"FACE_MEAT","title":"Sweet Currant","url":"https://redd.it/bkejjb","vendor":{"name":"Capella","code":"CAP"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"CAP","title":"Sweet Currant"}},
