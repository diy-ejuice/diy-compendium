The end of the exhale has a VERY slight eggy flavour, kind of like the taste left in your mouth after eating a hard boiled egg. The VG is sweetening the whole thing up some. Not even half as bad as I expected, pleasantly surprised. I'd say it tastes more like a slightly runny white than yolk but it's not overly eggy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Possible usage?** Bit stumped here. I'm not very imaginative when it comes to pairings and struggling to think of what you'd add a slight egg note to in a vape.","author":"horrend","title":"Egg Yolk (Cooked)","url":"https://redd.it/agc3hz","vendor":{"name":"Flavour Art","code":"FA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FA","title":"Egg Yolk (Cooked)"}},
