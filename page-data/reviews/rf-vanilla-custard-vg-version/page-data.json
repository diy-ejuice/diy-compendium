If anyone knows anything I should do differently feel free to let me know. I promise I won't cry ;) Maybe...lol\n\n&nbsp;\n\nPlease understand these are just my opinions, and I have only been mixing for about 8 months. I hope it helps. These flavors really do need at least a 4 week steep to fully develop the flavors. VG just doesn't carry the flavor like PG. However, even using higher percentages, if they are single flavors it's not using any more flavoring than they usual 15-20% of combines flavors that is commonly used with a lot of flavoring. These are not super concentrated like INW or FA.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Vanilla Custard**\n\n- Used 10% @ 1 week steep. Sweet vanilla cream. Very mild, not rich. Not surprised, as it's custard and only been 1 week. No eggy taste to this, more cream than custard. Good, but not memorable. I like it as a vanilla cream type accent flavor, but need more from a custard. Will try again at 4 weeks, it needs steeping for sure. Might need to go 12-15% on this one for SF. I will update and rate after further steeping.\n- At a 4 week steep. The flavor has really improved on this. I would still not call it a custard, but it's a very creamy instant vanilla pudding. No egginess and still not rich. Nice sweet vanilla. Not super strong, good strength in the RDA, I think it would be too mild at 10% in a tank. I would aim for 12-15% SF for tanks. Not sure in a mix, probably start at 4% and go from there. I would not vape this as a custard, more as a mixer, this isn't even in the category of Capellas. It's good though and similar to vanilla swirl, but a better version imho.\n","author":"mysticrosell","title":"Vanilla Custard VG Version","url":"https://redd.it/4rhci0","vendor":{"name":"Real Flavors","code":"RF"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"RF","title":"Vanilla Custard VG Version"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
