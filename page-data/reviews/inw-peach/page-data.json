    "result": {"data":{"reviewsJson":{"markdown":"**Setup:** Recoil w/ flavor barrel, Dual 15 wrap 26g 3mm Nifethal 70 coils @.17 ohms.  60w power, 450F temp limit. Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** INW Peach @ %2, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 16 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** A pretty solid darker peach nectar flavor.  Not super bright or realistic, but full and with just a bit of sweetness.  Tastes a bit cooked but not like canned peaches cooked. Doesn't get too candied or floral until you start pushing the percentages relatively high. A little bit of an earthiness on the back end, but no real green peel notes.\n\nInhale is fairly light, with a soft, fairly natural tasting peach juice sweetness. Exhale has a nice round peach nectar flavor. Errs more toward a softer flavor, rather than crazy bright and candy-like. Some pretty mellow peachier top notes, but those are pretty far down in the mix at 2% and under.  Just a little less dense than I want with something this juicy, but the exhale isn't noticeably astringent or anything.  Exhale dries out a bit on the back-end, with some earthy spiciness.  Clean finish, but that slightly dry earthy note lingers for a while.\n\n**Off-flavors:** I get some muddiness on the back end of this. It doesn't really taste like a greener peel kind of flavor. It's more sort of an earthy spiciness, kind of similar to INW Cherries. It's not a huge deal, especially when the rest of this is really solid, but I tend to notice it solo and it does some subtle, but weird things to creamier flavors when paired.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Light. It's there, but it's really mellow for this type of flavor.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This is a great peach to pair with some of the other, more floral peaches, to get a fuller peach flavor. This stuff can provide you with a lot of low-end that FLV Peach or FA White Peach seem to be missing without destroying your throat like TFA Juicy Peach.\n\nGood peach for fruit mixes. This will get some juicyness and a solid peach flavor without introducing too much throat hit or sharpness.  Peach flavors work pretty well with just about any kind of fruit, and the lack of harshness here is going to make it easy to stick it with just about anything.  If you are going to mix peaches and citruses, I'd definitely recommend INW Peach, just because you'll need all the help you can get on limiting throat hit.\n\nI think it's a good mixer with creams, but with the caveat that your cream is going to take on some of the fruit juicyness, as opposed to being just a peach-flavored cream.  I think it'll do a better job in a situation where you'd want some of that fruit body like a yogurt, as opposed a custard where the richer, creamier texture is more important.\n\nBakery-wise, I think you'd be better off sticking with something that needs a juicy peach filling. The juicy part of this concentrate is going to make it fairly difficult to get a really crispy, dry crust.  In those kind of drier mouthfeel situations, FLV Peach is probably your best bet.\n\nI personally think this is too moist for drier nut and tobacco mixes.\n\n**Notes:**  S&V concentration testing, this seems to hit it's stride around 1%.  At .25% and .5% it seems fairly weak with some juiciness but not a whole lot of flavor. 1% has a good hit of juiciness, and some of that sweeter peach flavor. 1.5% is starting to push more into a clear peach nectar. 2% is getting a bit thicker and sweeter, but I'm picking up some of that kind of murky back end. 3% has that peach flavor up front, but it's starting to get a little sharp and candy-ish. By 4% theres a pretty noticeable floral edge here.  I'd start at 1% and work up if you're after a natural kind of peach flavor. If you want a peach for pairing with heavier bases, maybe start at 2% and go from there.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[FOTW peach post with some love for INW Peach.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/3wtbgz/flavor_of_the_week_peach/)  Manson: \"After trying a few different peaches, INW has been the only one that didn't taste off to me. It's a darker Peach flavor, unlike FA White Peach. It tastes almost like the syrup in a can of peaches, but not as sickeningly sweet. Pairs perfectly with creams, as well as counterbalancing bright fruit mixes.\"\n\nSkiddlz follows with \"Fuckin INW peach. Peach rings @3%. Peach juice @1.5%. Fuckin delicious at any %.\"\n\n[Here's the ELR Page.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/2307) Lots of quick takes. Generally positive, most mention a higher concentration.\n\n[So in a review for CAP Juicy Peach /u/psyki/ gave a quick rundown of a couple of peaches.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/5cxmeu/cap_juicy_peach/) Their take on it's a little dour, \"experts only, even at low percentages can taste very \"earthy\". Tastes like a legit peach when used correctly though.\" I wanted to include it for some balance here because I totally pick up some of that odd sort of muddy backend on this stuff.\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Peach","url":"https://redd.it/5yr6ld","vendor":{"name":"Inawera","code":"INW"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"INW","title":"Peach"}},
