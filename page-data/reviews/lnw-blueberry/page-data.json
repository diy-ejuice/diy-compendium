Sweet blueberry flavor, think blueberry muffins. this doesn't have the chalky aspect that I detected in the other fruit flavors from LNW, making it more versatile. it has an inherent sweetness to it that might be limiting and takes it away from true blueberry-ness, but should be nice in sweet blueberry mixes. This probably needs other supporting blueberry to reach true potential.\n\n**Off-flavors:** sweetness, but that's not bad, right?\n\n**Throat Hit:** no\n\n**Uses & Pairings:** this will pair beautifully with cheesecake, blueberry muffins, and other bakeries (example: pancakes/waffles). I would keep this out of fruit mixes personally, but it could work if you like them sweet.\n\n**Notes:** 5% here is not very strong, this one could be used rather high I think. I'll use this space to say that I think these flavors would be better if they were more concentrated, however, the low concentration also makes them more forgiving for newbies. another problem is the price point: $3.29 for 15ml that needs 5% for usefulness? seems a bit steep. \n\n**Second Opinions:** nothing yet.","author":"PerennialPhilosopher","title":"Blueberry","url":"https://redd.it/68to7y","vendor":{"name":"Liquid Nicotine Wholesale","code":"LNW"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"LNW","title":"Blueberry"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
