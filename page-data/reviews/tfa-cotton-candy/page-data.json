A lot of DIY'ers scorn the use of it and vendors use it in a lot of mixes. If you want added sweetness to your mixes, get some and test it out.  \n\nUse it like you'd use sweetener in a drink or salt in food.  \n\nIf your a stealth vaper, I'd leave this one out. I go to dive bars, clubs and concerts/shows occasionally and I can pick this smell out like a bloodhound. \n\nThe majority of DIY mixers regard cotton candy the same as EM,  Ethyl Maltol.\n\n\n**Nose Neat:**  \n\nMuted cotton candy.\n\n\n**Flavor Description:**  \n\nSweet.
