I know, but that was the percentage given for use by Chefs Flavours.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Equipment Used:**  Troll RDA with a wickless single SS .8 ohm Clapton coil at 20W.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**PG/VG:** 30/70\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Steep Time:** 31 Days\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Aroma:** Vanilla, heavy cream, caramel, custard.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Flavor Description:** This is a very heavy, rich, thick custard with great body and mouth feel. Just lightly sweet more like a flan, not as sweet as typical American pudding. First flavor that hits is a rich dark type vanilla. It also has a very smooth yet rich egg custard base that is balanced very well, still allowing the vanilla to stay to the front. Exhale gives me a hint of warm caramel, but a bit more of something? I almost want to say a mild and understated tobacco like a sweet RY4 maybe. Overall a very complex flavor that tastes like it's intended to be a One-Shot. And pulls it off well.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:** Tobacco\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit:** 3/10\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Pairings:** Avoid citrus and heavy fruits. It's already so dense and rich that dark fruits will weigh it down. Coffee, cookies, cakes, cereal, creams, custards, nuts, tobaccos, spices, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Notes:** I was a little afraid of this one because of the recommended 20% usage. However, I was pleasantly surprised by the flavor level. It doesn't seem over flavored and is very good. But it's not an ADV for me due to the richness. I can see myself enjoying this for a couple hours though, especially with coffee. However, the smell when vaping is A M A Z I N G! I honestly think this will be much more vapeable in the 10% range and seems to be strong enough to hold up. It will require further testing, but if lowering the percentage helps reduce the richness while still allowing full flavor I can see myself using this more often. Otherwise, it will be a delicious rich custard dessert with my after dinner coffee. In mixes I'm going to try 1-3%.\n\n**EDIT:** I had a typo in the name in the title. It is actually Chefs Flavours, not Chefs Vapours.","author":"mysticrosell","title":"Welsh Custard","url":"https://redd.it/5relb1","vendor":{"name":"Chef's Flavours","code":"CF"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"CF","title":"Welsh Custard"}},
