I’m getting the realistic dark berry notes upfront with a sweet macerated blueberry throughout the exhale. It’s not sugary per se but it has that baked taste like the ‘blueberry’ in a Lil Debbie’s blueberry muffin. Not a very dense flavor and lacking in body (mainly getting top and bottom notes).\n\n**Off-flavors**: Nothing really, no fruit peels or anything like that. \n\n**Throat hit**: Smooth, little to none.\n\n**Uses**: I’m sticking this in muffin recipes right at 2-3% so that it stands up to whatever else I throw at it. This is not like FW blueberry and the closest thing I could say would be FA bilberry. This is like a slightly brighter bilberry to me, so I’d use also where you might use that but don’t want such a dark berry flavor.\n\n\n**Pairings**: Other berries (especially other blueberries, blackberry or raspberry), fruits (apples, pears, orange, peach, pineapple, rhubarb, banana and watermelon), creams, custards, cinnamon, nuts especially almond, honey, ginger\n\n**Notes**: I have not worked extensively with this and I’m not sure which other blueberry I want to join with this one (to add body) but I am leaning toward CAP blueberry 1-2% + RF blueberry 1-2% for bakery stuff, custards and blueberry blends. I think this one will need help standing up to heavier stuff like TPA VBIC or CAP VC. I’d keep the creams lighter, maybe stuff w/o diketones like FLV cream or FA Vienna/fresh. \n\nThis is not the answer to blueberry struggles but it is a nice flavor and I gotta say I prefer it to FW or CAP standalone just because it is not tiring to vape on. Edit: take this with a grain of salt, I just can't enjoy blueberry for too long before it tires my sense out, especially the very candy/jammy artificial ones.\n\n**Second Opinions**\nLimited notes about the VG version on [ELR](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/80766)\t\n\nNot too much out there but if you have had the RF blueberry muffin this is the same blueberry without the muffin.\n\nEdit: deleted repeated shit ","author":"HashSlingingSlashur","title":"Blueberry SC","url":"https://redd.it/60wu8z","vendor":{"name":"Real Flavors","code":"RF"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"RF","title":"Blueberry SC"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
