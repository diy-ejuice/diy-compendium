I know, just using the percentage given for use by Chefs Flavours, pretty sure this is a One-Shot.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Equipment Used:**  Troll RDA with a wickless single SS .8 ohm Clapton coil at 20W.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**PG/VG:** 30/70\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Steep Time:** 32 Days\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Aroma:** Sweetness, vanilla, cream, slight caramel like bavarian cream, light play doh. Smells exactly like their Welsh Custard (very distinctive) with a little added play doh.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Flavor Description:** First thing that hits me is, you guessed it, strong play doh. I do get a cakey note/body, and a light sugary glaze flavor. I'm getting a slight malt or chocolate flavor? Just very faint but present. The custard is very well balanced with the play doh, ahem, doughnut. The custard component does taste and smell almost exactly like their Welsh Custard, although the doughnut seems to absorb the super richness and egg aspect of the Welsh, so it's not as heavy. Nice bakery vanilla extract flavor, and overall a moist full bodied vape. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:** Malt or chocolate.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit:** 2/10\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Pairings:** This is a pretty complete flavor profile. I would say anything you would consider a good topping for a custard filled doughnut. Any fruit, especially berries or apple, maybe apple pie, chocolate, caramel, maple, white chocolate, coffee, nuts, tobaccos, spices, cinnamon.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Notes:** I am probably the wrong person to be reviewing this flavor as I'm sensitive to the doughnut flavors. If you like doughnut flavors, you will probably love this. If you usually taste play doh with doughnut flavorings, avoid this one. I apparently haven't given up on finding that perfect doughnut\nvape as I keep trying even though I say I give up :( If I broke this down, I'd say it tastes exactly like CAP Glazed Donut mixed with their Welsh Custard with a little meringue thrown in to add to the sweet glaze. This seems to have good strength at the 20%, and although it doesn't seem over flavored, I might consider trying it at 15% to see if it really needs the full 20%. I would definitely drop it to at least 10-12% if adding accent flavors.","author":"mysticrosell","title":"The Doughnut King","url":"https://redd.it/5rldfb","vendor":{"name":"Chef's Flavours","code":"CF"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"CF","title":"The Doughnut King"}},
