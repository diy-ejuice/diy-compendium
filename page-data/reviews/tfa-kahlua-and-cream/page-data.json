Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** TPA Kalua and Cream @ 1%,3%, 5%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 14 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  A thick, heavy kalua and cream for about 5 seconds before it starts to gunk and burn.  I was happy, and then I was sad. Blacker than sin in the bottle, this is 100% going to destroy your wicks.  It's a pretty decent flavor overall, but 3% seems to be the tipping point where it gets really weird and starts to burn.  Should be mostly useful as a thick accent for coffee vapes, but really keep it at 2% and under.\n\nTested at 1%, inhale has some higher sweet kalua mellow coffee top notes, with a denser cream base.  A bit light and heavily sweet, but balanced overall. Exhale is largely the same, with those coffee notes coming out more clearly.  I still think there may be a bit of gunking, because I'm getting a scarily accurate roasted coffee top note. Heavy whipped cream base, with a buttery exhale. Pretty sweet overall, with a dense, rich mouthfeel. Lingering slightly bitter coffee notes and a buttery mouthfeel.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  The flavor here is actually pretty good. The cream portion of this has a sort of heavier, almost buttery whipped cream taste to it instead of a straight cream.  There is the entire burned/gunked thing at 3% and up though.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Nah, fam.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  The utility of this concentrate is hampered by whatever the hell is going on here with the gunking. Personally, I'd never let this get near a tank.  Anything over 2% and you'll be rewicking every 10 minutes if you don't want to pink up a flat, muted, and slightly burnt gunky coil taste.\n\nUsed at a lower percentage, this has some good volume and a nice heavy, almost whipped cream and a lighter, sweet coffee liqueur taste. I can't get a strong enough flavor without gunking to really recommend it as a primary note, but it should work okay as backup in coffee vapes with a cream component, just for some added thickness and richness.\n  \n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, the limiting factor is definitely when this concentrates starts to taste gunky and burns. With my steeped samples, I'm getting a clear gunk taste at 3%, so I'd keep it under that. S&V tasting, this isn't a super concentrated flavor. It's weak in flavor at .25 and .5%. 1% has a subtle coffee sweetness, and a thicker mouthfeel. 2% doesn't immediately jump out as burning, and really pushes that thick, buttery whip cream. At 3%, I get about 3 drags before I start to taste that gunk.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Post from user \"prokreat\" declaring \"YUK!\" No note of percentage used, but since it's 2 years ago I'm guessing it was fairly high.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/32kacb/tfa_kahluacream_yuk_back_to_drawing_board/)\n\n[On ELR, user \"Ghettotrout\" nails it: \"Such a bummer. Tastes really good, but turns into a hot mess pretty quick. Tastes like burnt coffee very quickly. Lots of sugars and tends to burn at low temps.\"](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/8030)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Kahlua and Cream","url":"https://redd.it/69j1nm","vendor":{"name":"The Flavor Apprentice","code":"TFA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"TFA","title":"Kahlua and Cream"}},
