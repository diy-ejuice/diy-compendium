It’s like a shitty raspberry candy. Not very tart or juicy. Its sweet and got a slight tinge of household cleaner notes and artificial raspberry. Lacks the darkness, juiciness or deliciousness of pomegranate flavor.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  The whole thing. Not even close to a pomegranate. \n\n**Throat Hit:**  at first it was harsh, after three days though (3/10)\n\n**Uses:**  This is useless. Its also dyed a pink/red color. I don’t know for a fact whether it is dye but why would it be pink. Will not use, do not recommend.\n\n**Pairings:**  The drain\n\n**Notes** DIY flavor shack has other good shit. They also have a line called flavors array (more concentrated line) and I hope those fruit flavors are better. I said I would review Maniacal Melons (watermelon apple flavor) and I will next but it is also a let down just not as bad as this.\n\n**Second Opinions**\n\nA review from 2013 saying its [very pom!]( https://www.diyflavorshack.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=Pomegranate-DIY-Flavoring) maybe my taste buds are fucked but this is bad\n\n\n","author":"HashSlingingSlashur","title":"Pomegranate","url":"https://redd.it/5p78y0","vendor":{"name":"DIY Flavor Shack","code":"DIYFS"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"DIYFS","title":"Pomegranate"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
