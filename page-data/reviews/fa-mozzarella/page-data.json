Actual mozzarella doesn't particularly taste of much anyway. There's a slight tang similar to cream cheese (but no feet) in a British cheesecake. Overall very mild but definitely not unpleasant.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAdded some more conc to see how it goes. Got a bit heavy handed so my 2% has ended up more around 2.5% - flavour is much more pronounced now, slightly more of the tang coming through. There's also some sharpness coming through that wasn't present at 1%, the VG might be taming this slightly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Possible usage?** This would probably work well in a British cheesecake recipe to give a more authentic taste and help thicken up any creams used.","author":"horrend","title":"Mozzarella","url":"https://redd.it/agc3sm","vendor":{"name":"Flavour Art","code":"FA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FA","title":"Mozzarella"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
