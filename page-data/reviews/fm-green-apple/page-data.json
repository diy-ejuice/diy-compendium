Light throat hit (but still there), some of the peel and its tartness, lightly sweet. And the best part it... no fucking acetone notes to it that many other green apples have!\n\nAfter steep: It doesn't change much after three days. Some tartness from the peel, somewhat sweet, some throat hit. No florals, more realistic then candy.\n\nOverall this is my favorite green apple. And i bought more then i ever need. My white wale for green apple ended with this one. Even though its pricey its totally worth it. Body wise, i can compare it with FA fuji apple. It holds his place against other strong flavors like FLV spearmint for example, making it versatile. Doesn't require much tweaking, and no nail polish off notes... do i need to say more? :)","author":"KillScreen-","title":"Green Apple","url":"https://redd.it/84rfgy","vendor":{"name":"Flavour Monks","code":"FM"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FM","title":"Green Apple"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
