Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Hangsen Honey @ %2, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 18 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Wet flowers. Tastes like a rose garden after it rains.  A sweeter base, but primarily a floral rose or geranium top note with some green underneath.  The significant other rates this as a 2 of 10 on the \"makes the room smell like cat piss\" scale, which is positive.\n\nInhale almost has a sour honey kind of taste, with some of that deep sweetness but a leafy green kind of sour top note. Exhale really just tastes like flowers. High floral rose/jasmine/geranium kind of top note. Some more of that leafy green kind of flavor underneath that, sort of like FA Jasmine.  Base sweetness is still there, and it could almost taste like honey I guess. Overall, the sweetness just moistens those floral top notes.  Lighter density, not unpleasant if you don't mind florals but this isn't anything close to a full honey flavor.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Not a lot of honey, so most of it?\n\n**Throat Hit:** Nah.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This is tricky.  It's not awful, I just can't think of a ton to do with it besides use it a floral sweetener.  Good to add body to a rose mix. Would work with INW Cactus to actually make it taste more like a cactus.\n\nTop notes here could stand in for like a floral raspberry top note, but I don't think anyone actually tastes a raspberry concentrate and thinks that it just needs to be more floral.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nS&V concentration testing, 1 drop per 10ml gives you about all the sweetness you are going to get out of this. It's a slightly sour sweetness without any kind of richness or body. It's definitely sweet, but I wouldn't call it honey. The floral notes just essentially scale up from there. .25% gets you that identifiable rose and it get's perfumey by .5%.  I'd recommend mixing with this at 1 drop per 10ml if you want to use this as a floral sweetener up to maybe .25% if you really want to push that rose floral note.\n\nIt's interesting, although not tasty stuff.  I've had some raw wildflower honey that has that a tiny bit of that rose top note.  Bees are into wild roses but the processing for honey drives off those really delicate floral top notes pretty quickly. I mean, it's not super unpleasant or anything but I'm a bit stumped about what to do with this. \n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nNot that I can find.\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Honey","url":"https://redd.it/5sgwdc","vendor":{"name":"Hangsen","code":"HS"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"HS","title":"Honey"}},
