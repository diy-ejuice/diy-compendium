Mild cherry, faintly medicinal.\n\n**Manufacturer's Description:** True to its name, this flavor is a superb Cherry Cola flavor with the perfect balance of fruit and beverage!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Suggested Percentage:** 5-10%\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Flavor Description:** Finally a real cherry cola! Although this doesn't have a carbonated fizz (how can it in all honesty?) if someone can invent that effect in flavoring they will make goooood money! It doesn't have that overly sweet flat cola flavor that has been in every cola flavor I have tried before. Very well balanced authentic cherry cola. The cola flavor has been balanced well with that artificial cherry that is usually found in soda acting as an accent flavor. It's not overly sweet or syrupy, and I think that might be why it avoids that flatness. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:** None\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit:** 1/10\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Uses:** Cherry cola single flavor. Cherry cola slurpee with some added WS-23 or Koolada. Maybe with a gummy candy flavor for cherry cola gummies? A vanilla would be good in this, just a plain vanilla like bourbon vanilla, nothing with cream notes. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Notes:** I'm not quite sure what this could used in. Excellent single flavor cherry cola. Although I don't like cherry cola, I might have to try this with some of that ws-23 cooling agent I requested and turn this into a yummy cherry cola slurpee. Good strength at this percentage, 6-8% for a single flavor.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Other Opinions:** From louiesquared on ELR. Very convincing Cherry Cola. Nicely balanced with no cough syrup aftertaste. It doesn’t taste like it’s carbonated but also not flat like most Cola flavors. I’m assuming the Cherry is adding this effect. I’m not really a Cola fan but I could definitely vape this all by itself.","author":"mysticrosell","title":"Cherry Cola","url":"https://redd.it/763wrj","vendor":{"name":"Purilum","code":"PUR"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"PUR","title":"Cherry Cola"}},
