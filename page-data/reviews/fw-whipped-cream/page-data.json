Not very dense I would give it a 2 out of 10, with no throat hit.                           \n\n**Flavor Properties**- Cream whipped to perfection, ( just before it turns into butter ), it's a light fluffy Dairy moderately sweet with none of the eggy or vanilla properties you find another creams and custards.         \n\n **Relatable Flavors** - Reminds me of Cool Whip, or drinking a glass of heavy cream.         \n\n**Position In The Recipe** - Given its light density, I believe this is going to be most useful as an accent to other creams give them up fluffy mouthfeel.\n\n**Pairings** - Other creams, bakeries,  chocolates, dark berry flavors, and a few nuts like pistachio, or hazelnut should really help make this flavor pop.","author":"Chrisdvr1","title":"Whipped Cream","url":"https://redd.it/4o3x8e","vendor":{"name":"Flavor West","code":"FW"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FW","title":"Whipped Cream"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
