    "result": {"data":{"reviewsJson":{"markdown":"**Setup:** Velocity 2 Clone, Dual 15 wrap 3mm Nifethal 70 coils @.18 ohms.  45W power, 480F temp limit. Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Papaya Punch @ 3%, 70/30 VG/PG, Steeped 11 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Tastes a lot like very artificial peach.  Bright and bit floral. More than a little astringent. Decent sweetness.  A strong clear flavor though that's fairly light on the palette.  Tastes like a peach flavor smirnoff-caliber vodka.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Sort of lingering bitter taste.  Not a rubber or plastic note, numbs my mouth a bit. Not obnoxiously prominent, but it's there. After vaping for a while it kind of builds into a gummy aftertaste.\n\n**Throat Hit:** 3/10. Pretty darn smooth all things considered.  \n\n**Uses:**  Would make a good basis for a gummy peach ring flavor with someone to enhance gummy mouth-feel.  Most fruit candies actually.  Thinner, non-dairy beverages like soda or cocktails.  I can't imagine it going well with thicker dairy notes, but it may useful for punching up the high notes on a tropical or peach milkshake.\n\n**Pairings:**  Your typical tropical nonsense. Any brighter fruit flavor.  Peaches. I'd stay away from heavy dark flavors unless you had something middle of the road acting like a bridge between the high notes here and a deeper base note.\n\n**Notes:**  If you told my this was an all in one cheap peach gummy rings flavor, I would probably believe you.  Doesn't really nail the papaya or the punch.  Given the name I was expecting a much richer fruityness.  It does have a light mouthfeel that might lend itself to beverage profiles and could probably be used effectively as a top note in mixes.","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Papaya Punch","url":"https://redd.it/5a8f1h","vendor":{"name":"Flavorah","code":"FLV"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FLV","title":"Papaya Punch"}},
