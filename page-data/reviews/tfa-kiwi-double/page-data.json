    "result": {"data":{"reviewsJson":{"markdown":"**Setup:** Plume Veil RDA; dual parallel @ .35Î©; cotton wicks; 45W\n\n**Testing:** TFA Kiwi Double @ 5%; Aged: 6 days\n\n**Flavor description:**  Candied kiwi taste, fairly sugared.  Sits nicely on the tongue.  Not extremely juicy per se, but not exactly dry either.  Maintains steady flavor through the inhale and exhale.  Slightly resembles a pear or green apple.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Slight boozy/wine note at 5%\n\n**Throat hit:** 4/10. \n\n**Uses:**  This flavor can be used to accent other fruits in a recipe, but I would keep it below 4% unless you're going for a kiwi-candy taste.\n\n**Pairings:** Other fruit flavorings.\n\n**Notes:** Doesn't exactly taste like an actual kiwi, but carries enough flavor profile to pass as kiwi candy flavor.  Not a great standalone, as it likes to be with other fruits.\n\nEDIT: [Link to all of our flavor reviews in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)","author":"wh1skeyk1ng","title":"Kiwi Double","url":"https://redd.it/4o51wy","vendor":{"name":"The Flavor Apprentice","code":"TFA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"TFA","title":"Kiwi Double"}},
