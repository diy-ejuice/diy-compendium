If anyone knows anything I should do differently feel free to let me know. I promise I won't cry ;) Maybe...lol\n\n&nbsp;\n\nPlease understand these are just my opinions, and I have only been mixing for about 8 months. I hope it helps. These flavors really do need at least a 4 week steep to fully develop the flavors. VG just doesn't carry the flavor like PG. However, even using higher percentages, if they are single flavors it's not using any more flavoring than they usual 15-20% of combines flavors that is commonly used with a lot of flavoring. These are not super concentrated like INW or FA.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Sweetened Condensed Milk**\n\n- Used 10% @ 1 week steep. Very authentic flavor especially in such a hard to find flavor. Sweetened milk with a nice rich thick mouth feel, with almost a hint of dulce de leche mixed in. Can't wait to try this again at 4 weeks, assuming it will get noticeably richer. Not a stand alone flavor for me, but oh what it will add to my mixes! I'm guessing 2-6% in blends.\n- At a 4 week steep. This is very very authentic and delicious. I'm not getting any hints of dulce de leche now that it has steeped. Pure thick sweet rich cream, great mouth feel. This will be getting a lot of use. Among many others, I can see replacing sweet cream with this. It's thicker and creamier. Can't wait to play. Cakes, custards, ice cream, 7 layer bars...mmmmmmmmm.\n\n**UPDATE:** UPDATE: This still continues to impress me, in the 1.5-6% range for mixes.","author":"mysticrosell","title":"Sweetened Condensed Milk VG Version","url":"https://redd.it/4rhdol","vendor":{"name":"Real Flavors","code":"RF"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"RF","title":"Sweetened Condensed Milk VG Version"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
