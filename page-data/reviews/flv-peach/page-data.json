    "result": {"data":{"reviewsJson":{"markdown":"**Setup:** Recoil w/ flavor barrel, Dual 15 wrap 26g 3mm Nifethal 70 coils @.17 ohms.  60w power, 450F temp limit. Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Peach @ 3%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 13 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**\nRelatively subtle and soft peach flesh.  Just a hint of perfumey rind.  It, may in fact, be the gospel.\n\nInhale is thin and has some building peach perfume bordering on almost piney. Still relatively light on the exhale. Exhale starts with a soft, fleshy bordering on buttery peach. Reminds me of a good, more subtle non-overripe / almost rancid version of something like CAP Sweet Mango.  Moderate sweetness here, but still very airy. Lingering peel notes.  The only thing I'm missing is some juicy body and punch to this.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Nope.  Maybe a touch perfumey and piney, but a lot better than the other peaches I've tried.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Very light, mostly over 2%. In the 1-2% Range, nothing really.\n\n**Uses:**  This peach is incredibly easy to blend. Fruit mixes, bakeries, creams, candies.  You name it, I'm pretty sure it can do it.  Almost a full peach, just lacking some fruit juicyness here.\n\n**Pairings:**  Wide open. Bright fruits, soft fruits, this could probably handle something a bit floral like pear.  Not really dense enough to cover a harsh citrus solo. Creams, custards, yogurts, bakeries.  This is a bit vague, but I'm pretty convinced this will work damn near anywhere you want a peach as long as you account for the thinness here.\n\nIf you are interested in a fuller peach, a low percentage of INW Peach for extra body and maybe just a bit of INW Cactus.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nWell covered on reddit, just lacking the single flavor review.  I got aboard the hype train and wanted to test this one out.\n\nS&V concentration testing, I get a nice round peach flavor down at 1%, but it's still relatively light.  I'd stay in the 1-1.5% range for a mix that isn't peach forward.  If you want to push those peaches to the front, I'd go up to 2%, with the caveat that you are going to need to get some density and juiciness from another concentrate.\n\nYeah, this is probably the gospel.  Tasty, highly concentrated, and really good for blending.\n\nShoutout to /u/apexified for sending this my way for review.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nLots of information on reddit.
