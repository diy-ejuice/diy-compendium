Shout out to Liquid Barn*\n\n**Setup:** Recoil w/ flavor barrel, Dual 15 wrap 26g 3mm Nifethal 70 coils @.17 ohms.  60w power, 450F temp limit. Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Liquid Barn Belgian Waffle, 4 and 8%  @ 1g/ml, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 32 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  I'm having some issues with this one, so maybe check the second opinions because at least some people are having a better time with this.\n\nI'm not really picking up that much waffle.  I get some light, pale yellow kind of eggo perfume out of it, but I'm missing almost all the body that I'd expect. There's a bit of volume to the waffle but not a whole lot of waffle flavor to fill it out.  What I do get is a little bready but not really crunchy.  More of a thawed eggo than toasted.\n\nThere's a little bit of buttery richness here, but it's doing the same thing a lot of the richer liquid barn flavors do for me and gives a richer mouthfeel than actual flavor. [The data sheet for this](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0307/9897/files/BelgianWaffle_DS.jpg?5513177427726715981) reports 1,100 ppm acetyl propionyl so I'm guessing it should taste a lot more buttery than does.  The butter I do get works pretty well, but overall this feels like it should taste a lot richer than it does.\n\nLiquid barn calls this \"drenched\" in syrup.  I wouldn't go that far.  You've got some plastic bottle grade maple syrup going on.  More just sweet than overwhelmingly maple. Overall, there isn't a ton of it, but it works pretty well with that eggoish vibe and light butter.\n\nI am picking up some weird off-flavors though.  At the suggested 8% I'm picking up something that tastes a little anise-ish. With the sweeter syrup it's almost like some one made a waffle with good and plenties instead of chocolate chips.  Not as prominent at 4%, but still present. Kind of like the weird anise note in CAP Yellow Cake or FA Nonna's Cake.  It could maybe an attempt at vanilla? There's also something that feels a lot like cinnamon in here. Not super prominent but distracting.\n\nWhile this has a lot of the flavors from the profile, it just doesn't work for me in texture.  I'm just getting a weird, lukewarm, light waffle with light butter and some watery syrup.  I'm not getting anything too crispy or even all the bready.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  I get a good deal of anise out of this, especially at 8%.  I also get some errant cinnamon occasionally.  Texture is thin and the syrup feels a bit watery.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Moderate? The base of the flavor feels a bit harsh, and then that cinnamon kicks up some throat hit as well.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 4% I'm not getting much out of this.  Kind of buttery on the lips, and some maple/anise syrup and cinnamon spice.  I'm not picking much waffle at all.\n\nAt 8% I'm getting a bit more waffle, but I definitely still want more. That anise note is also showing up quite a bit more for me here. Maple isn't overwhelming, and this has a bit more butter, but still feels a bit thin overall.\n\nLiquid barn suggests mixing this at 8%, although that anise thing is pretty distracting for me there.  I'd probably be closer to 5-6% trying to avoid the worst of it.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I think if you were using this you'd have to bump up the butter, and the waffle, and probably the maple.  For an eggo-ish flavor I like Capella a bit more, and for something more continental, you've got other options.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nNoted did an episode on waffles and pancakes and this was one of the included flavors. [Talk about this flavor starts about 19 minutes in.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMOFjJMTMYo&t=19m7s) CheebaSteeba likes it, but other reactions were a little more lukewarm.  Selected quotes include: \"better than\" some of the other options. \"Nothing weird.\" \"It's okay.\" \"Eggo Waffle with some butter and syrup, but such a thin amount that you'll have to supplement it.\"  \"Bready body.\"  \"Not super rich.\"  \"Thin layer.\" \"Some warmth.\" \n\n[Here's the ELR Page.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/67291)  User \"jojo\" writes: \"6% (SnV - weak and kind of nondescript. 10 days - better. Still a little weak but getting more sweetness and what tastes like a hint of cinnamon. 2 weeks - not much here. 3 weeks - seems pretty nice now. With some butter and maple, it’d probably be a good waffle. 5 weeks - back to being weak. I’d up % a little if it’s supposed to be the main flavor and make sure it was vaped around 3-4 weeks.)\"  User \"hockeyfish\" writes: \"Tested at 9% @ 3.5 weeks - very week. taste a little maple syrup on inhale and really nothing on exhale. Tested at 12% @ 1 week - very nice maple syrup taste, not much waffle really, maybe a bit of cinnamon. Is a little harsh, maybe from the alcohol. Maybe try letting it breath a bit to remove alcohol.\"  User \"Amy***\" writes: \"Has a great syrupy aspect to this one not that it's overbearing w/ the soppy stuff but it's a nice breadiness of the waffles balanced by the sweetness of the syrup.\"\n\n[User \"Amy2\" has quick reviews up on the ELR Forum.  Her take: \"Very good syrup to buttery ratio I only used it as a mixer can't say what it was like as a stand alone. Found it to be more forgiving than other vendors with the maple syrup not as prevalent easing the mixing quality.\"](http://forum.e-liquid-recipes.com/t/liquid-barn-tasting-notes/66705)\n\n[Liquid Barn's product page.  Their description: \"A mouth-watering blend of a warm buttery waffle drenched in pure, rich maple syrup.\"  The suggested mixing percentage is 8%.](https://www.liquidbarn.com/products/belgian-waffle-eliquid-extract)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Belgian Waffle","url":"https://redd.it/7c7b9v","vendor":{"name":"Liquid Barn","code":"LB"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"LB","title":"Belgian Waffle"}},
