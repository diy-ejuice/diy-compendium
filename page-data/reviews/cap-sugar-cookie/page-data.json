Not as dry/crunchy of a mouth feel as FA Cookie, but more like a thinner cookie baked so the outside crunches the slightest bit, yet the inside remains soft.\n\n**Off-flavors:** I'm getting a bit of anise or strong dark spice, reminiscent of something like FA Nonna's Cake but nowhere NEAR as strong.  I'd say it's easily tolerable in this concentrate.\n\n**Throat hit:** 6/10\n\n**Uses:**  Pastries, cakes, pies, etc. There are many popular dessert recipes that use CAP Sugar Cookie at varying percentages.  Check them out, or enjoy it standalone at a higher percentage.\n\n**Pairings:**  Various creams, graham cracker, nuts, cakes, tobaccos, some of your juicier fruit flavors.  I'd say it's pretty tough to mess up a pairing with this flavor, just don't over-do it.\n\n**Notes:**   This flavor is a must have in your arsenal if you're into dessert-type mixes.  Very versatile and also makes a great standalone flavor due to it's depth.","author":"wh1skeyk1ng","title":"Sugar Cookie","url":"https://redd.it/4svlne","vendor":{"name":"Capella","code":"CAP"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"CAP","title":"Sugar Cookie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
