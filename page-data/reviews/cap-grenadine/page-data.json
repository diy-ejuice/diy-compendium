Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** CAP Grenadine, 2 and 4%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 6 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Nightmare cherry.  There is some syrupy cheap grenadine sweetness in there, but the first thing you notice is a face full of those weird, harsh, gasoline or plastic off notes that are depressingly common from cherry flavors. Good grenadine is basically pomegranate syrup, and I can't really taste anything resembling pomegranates.  Tastes more like bright red maraschino cherry syrup. No real tartness in here, more of a chalky artifical cherry candy sweetness.  Personally I'd give it a pass, but if you are going to use it I'd keep it under 3% to limit *some* of those off-notes.\n\nInhale is sharp and bitter from those medicinal plastic off notes.  There's a syrupy sweetness underneath, but it just drags the inhale to full on cough syrup. Medium density, but pretty harsh.  Exhale has a whole lot of those off-notes right up. Cheap plastic off-gassing, gasoline, bitter florals.  Some candy cherry sweetness comes out in the back end. Really light tartness that you'd expect from a decent grenadine, but a whole lot closer to a chalky cherry candy. There is some syrupy sweetness in there, but those off-notes come roaring back in on the tail end of the exhale, with a lingering bitter plastic taste.  Medium density, but the throat hit is kind of hellacious.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Really prominent bitter, floral gasoline and plastic.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Harsh.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Really,  I don't think this is the best option for any mix. This doesn't taste a lot like pomegranate syrup, so I'd skip all of the realistic grenadine applications.\n\nThis is gnarly, even for lowered cherry standards.  I wouldn't use it anywhere you wanted maraschino cherries either.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, this is less bad at lower percentages. At 1% I still get a helping of off notes, but they aren't particularly intense. Underlying sweet artificial cherry is pretty weak though. 2% is a little fuller. I'm still getting off flavors, but the sweetness is a little clearer. 3% has a decent-ish sweetness to it and the off-notes aren't that much worse than 2%. 4% has really intense off notes. 5% is pretty much unvapable with those off flavors getting extremely bitter.\n\n[FA Pomegranate isn't perfect](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/5ub1i8/fa_pomegranate/) but that and some sweetener would probably be my best bet on a grenadine that tasted like a pomegranate was involved at some point.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  Hey, some people don't hate this?\n\n[Here's the ELR Page.  We got camps on here, people. User \"Devils Advocate\" calls it \"Bitter, cherry, almond, the almond looking thing in a peach pit, citrus, spray paint.\"  User \"Quakas\" has a review that (via Google Translate from Portuguese) reads like a tone poem of awfulness: \"Strangely and after 2 versions know the bitter almond, here in the original packaging the grenadine continues to know the bitter almond, absolute disillusionment fails to take the test.\"  On the other hand /u/MintyMods says \"S&V - Taste a little medicinal, similar to pomegranate, would pair with fruits, absinthe, menthol, floral and obviously alcohol. Can't see it pairing with creams, bakery, nuts.\" /u/RinVapes is probably the most positive on the page with \"authentic. can be used in place of maraschino cherry for some applications (drinks, candy, etc) Preferred single flavor mix: 0.5%\" so maybe it's a concentration thing.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/19018)\n\n[I don't know, people seem to dig this on ECX. 5 star average with 5 reviews.](http://www.ecigexpress.com/diy-e-liquid/diy-e-liquid-flavors/capella-flavor-drops/grenadine-by-capella-flavor-drops.html)\n\n[/u/SecretVape asks for help on a recipe that tastes like burnt tires, culprit is the 9% Cap Grenadine. /u/BongleBear clarifies \"I have had absolutely no luck at all with CAP Grenadine.
