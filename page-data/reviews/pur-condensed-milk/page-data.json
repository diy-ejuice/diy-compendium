It has great mouth feel and body, the cream flavor being more prominent than milk. I would describe it as moderately sweet cream on steroids. It's very close, but missing the richness and extreme sweetness of Condensed Milk. This will be a really versatile flavor that will pair well with almost any flavor.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:** None\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit:** 1/10\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Pairings:** Desserts, custards, coffees, bakeries, cookies, vanillas, cereals. This will be a really versatile flavor that will pair well with almost any flavor.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Notes:** This is not a SF for me, 2-6% in blends.\n","author":"mysticrosell","title":"Condensed Milk","url":"https://redd.it/5mwt0k","vendor":{"name":"Purilum","code":"PUR"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"PUR","title":"Condensed Milk"}},
