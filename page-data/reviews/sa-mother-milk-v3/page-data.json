Also there is a \"clove\" off note glued to the strawberry the and crust part of the flavor as SnV. Chemical taste on the cream side. Strawberry is extremely muted.\n\n%7.5 after 4 days: Clove off note gets really muted, gets spicier and less floral and it blends with crust. Crust tastes much more unique but still waaay more accurate. %90 of the chemical taste in creams/vanilla disappear. Accuracy gets better and it gives that crusty creamy feel on exhale, and a little creamy mouthfeel that fills your mouth while inhale. Strawberry gets less juicy and more syrupy, its not bright enough but not disturbingly dark.  \n\n**&#128313; Comments &#128313;**  \nI think the clove off note is floral and spicy at the same time, so it blends well with the overall flavor unlike other off-notes.\nIt's also SWEET ENOUGH so don't use any sweetener in your mix (i used 0.75% fw sweetener and this thing turned out \"commercially sweet\". so you can probably guess why is it sweet enough).\nVanilla is little bit dull.\nNot worth as a sf but can be used to make your recipes ultra authentic and different.\n\nCreams or vanilla doesn't taste like plastic even if you steep just 7 days, unlike other creams. (i get plastic notes from cap bavarian cream and tpa bavarian cream)\n\n*EXAMPLE RECIPE:\n\nSA Mother Milk v3 %5.5\nFA Red Touch %2.5\nCAP Vanilla Bean Ice Cream %1.5\nSA Framboise Sabayon %0.5","author":"romngenie","title":"Mother Milk v3","url":"https://redd.it/l49wgl","vendor":{"name":"Solub Arome","code":"SA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"SA","title":"Mother Milk v3"}},
