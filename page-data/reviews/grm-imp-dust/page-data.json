This was unexpected for me since I normally require some steep for this flavor profile to be enjoyable for me.\nAfter about 10 days the blackberry starts to mellow in and the custard comes out more with a mild almost creamy pudding-like texture and just the hint of the right eggy undertone.\nI like vaping Imp Dust in temperature control, where lower temperatures support the custard more and higher temperatures bring more presence to the blackberry.  \n\n**&#128313; Comments &#128313;**  \nThis concentrate is available at Bull City Flavors, Chefs Flavors or directly at Gremberry Farms. Recommended usage is 15%-20% and it settled nice for me at 16.67% (5 ml in a 30 ml mix), where it is fully present and not middle in your face. SessionDrummer, who posts regularly at ELR, tested it at 13% and was very satisfied at that percentage.","author":"Steve-TC","title":"Imp Dust","url":"https://redd.it/rf7a31","vendor":{"name":"Gremberry Farms Solo's","code":"GRM"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"GRM","title":"Imp Dust"}},
