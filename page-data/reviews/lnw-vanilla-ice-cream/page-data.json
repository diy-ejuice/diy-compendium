The mouthfeel is nice and thick. This is the best diketone free vanilla cream I have ever tried. I don't get any of the off-flavors I normally detect in diketone free concentrates. This won't replace my TFA VBIC, but it will certainly get some use!\n\n**Off-flavors:** surprisingly none!\n\n**Throat Hit:** none to speak of.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:** the vanilla is pretty strong here so i would stick to vanilla pairings like \"basically everything\". 5% seems like a great starting point for a main flavor, but i could see less being used as a vanilla accent, and maybe a bit of thickness.\n\n**Notes:** LNW was kind enough to offer me a 75% off coupon so that i may review their entire line. All 17 of the flavors i didn't have arrived today, so expect 17 more LNW reviews in the future as my time allows. I emailed them about the MSDS for each flavor so that i may include them with the reviews (for all you anti-diketone people and science nerds). I promise to keep my reviews as objective as humanly possible.\n\n**Second Opinions:** still not a one.","author":"PerennialPhilosopher","title":"Vanilla Ice Cream","url":"https://redd.it/69j26r","vendor":{"name":"Liquid Nicotine Wholesale","code":"LNW"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"LNW","title":"Vanilla Ice Cream"}},
