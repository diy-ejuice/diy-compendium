Mixed 70/30 1.5mg NIC. Tested at 2,3.5,&5%.\n\n\n**At 2%:** Felt full flavored, and the flavor was there freshly mixed. On the back of hand it tasted like a candied sour blackcurrant. When vaped sweetness was up front. Tartness was in the back. Blackcurrant tasted candy like. Didn’t notice any harshness or off notes.\n\n**At 3.5%** Noticeably sweeter and had more tartness. Also had a little a bit of harshness, and the blackcurrant felt more syrupy.\n\n**At 5%** The harshness was no worse than it was at 3.5%. Flavor wise it was sweeter, more sour, and had a more syrup like blackcurrant. Still no off notes\n\n\n**Pairings:** Fruits such as strawberries,tobaccos,desserts,or creams\n\n\n**Conclusion:** Vape Train describes it like so. “a smooth rounded flavour that would suit most e-juice recipe requirements. It’s subtle sweet and not overpowering like it’s counterparts in the marketplace. Easy to work with on a variety of mixes from tobaccos, fruit blends and even creams bakeries and desserts will benefit from this unique flavouring.” They also recommend using it at 2-5%. \n\nThey don't mention the tartness in the description but i definitely detect it. They also say it doesn’t over power the other ingredients, but i used it @2% in one of my tobacco recipes and it completely overpowered my tobaccos. I remixed and dropped it down to 1.5% bumped up my other ingredients, and it worked.\n\nFor solo testing i would start at 2% and work my way up. For mixing depending on what you are after anywhere from .25-2% should work.\n","author":"ebc88","title":"Shisha Blackcurrant","url":"https://redd.it/85lgg3","vendor":{"name":"Vape Train Australia","code":"VTA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"VTA","title":"Shisha Blackcurrant"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
