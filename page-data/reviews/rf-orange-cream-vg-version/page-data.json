If anyone knows anything I should do differently feel free to let me know. I promise I won't cry ;) Maybe...lol\n\n&nbsp;\n\nPlease understand these are just my opinions, and I have only been mixing for about 8 months. I hope it helps. These flavors really do need at least a 4 week steep to fully develop the flavors. VG just doesn't carry the flavor like PG. However, even using higher percentages, if they are single flavors it's not using any more flavoring than they usual 15-20% of combines flavors that is commonly used with a lot of flavoring. These are not super concentrated like INW or FA.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Orange Cream**\n\n- Tested 10% @ 1 week steep. I like this one as well. It is a very good realistic slightly sweet orange, not that artificial orange flavoring found in most orange creams. Smooth and no harsh throat hit at all. However, the cream is very light with a tiny hint of vanilla and hides behind the orange. Just get a hint of it on exhale. Hopefully the cream will strengthen with a normal 4 week steep as it's a lovely flavor. If the cream doesn't come out to play, I would tend to use this more as just a plain realistic orange. But I expect the creams to develop more with time, haven't met one yet that doesn't.\n- At a 4 week steep. This is still very very light in the cream department, I probably wouldn't notice it much if I wasn't looking for it. It's still a very realistic slightly sweet orange flavor. Not in your face acidic. Good, but not sure if it's strong enough to hold up to the added creams that would be required to make it a true orange cream flavor. I don't see a use for it for me. Please remember that taste is subjective, and while this might not hit the spot for me, it's not a bad flavor either. Just not in my wheelhouse.","author":"mysticrosell","title":"Orange Cream VG Version","url":"https://redd.it/4rho23","vendor":{"name":"Real Flavors","code":"RF"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"RF","title":"Orange Cream VG Version"}},
