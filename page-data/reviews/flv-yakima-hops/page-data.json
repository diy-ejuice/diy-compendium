Earthy, somewhat dry (but that calms down with steep it seems), has floraly/citrusy notes about it. Provides an interesting body to the vape, considering it's bright and light. I can see this working itself in to a lot of different types of vapes, especially with florals, earthy notes, citrus. Overall I enjoy the vape it gives. With the body it gives this works great as a base flavor. I could see using it to accent other ingredients as well. \n\n**On the Nose**  \n[Dank](http://www.dank-colorado.com/wp-content/uploads/DANK-Bud_0001_Sour-Diesel1.jpg), bright, non-aggressive\n\n**Recommended Usage**  \n*Stand alone*: 2-5%\n\n*In a mix*: 0.5-3%.  \n\n**Throat**  \nMild, slightly dry\n\n**Ideal Pairings**  \nBright tropical fruits, florals, earthy flavors, citrus, bright fruits.\n\n**Steep**  \nI'd give this one a good week or so to really develop the body and tone some of the dryness down.\n\n**Recipe Idea: Summer Guava**  \n*Steep:* 1-2 Weeks\n*Ratio: 12.5PG/87.5VG*  \n  \n**Ingredient**|**%**|\n:--|:--|\nFLV Yakima Hops|1%|\nFLV Elderflower|0.5%|\nFLV Pink Guava|0.25%|\n\nHere the Yakima hops serve as a base flavor, providing body and being the main flavor the other notes sort of ride on. The Guava and Elderflower play off the of citrus and floral/earthy notes that you get from the hops. You can bring the Guava up to 0.5% to bring it more forward, it's really just accenting the Hops in this application. \n\n*Please if your opinion differs, or you have another review for this post it in the comments.
