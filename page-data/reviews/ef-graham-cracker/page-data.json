Perfect for s'mores and pie crusts. Works well with a wide variety of flavors.\"*\n\n**Testing Setup:** SXMini Faucon RDTA with a four-wrap SS316L single clapton at 0.35 ohms. Cotton wicks. 30 watts.\n\n**Flavor Notes:** EuroFlavor's description of this concentrate isn't all that accurate. Is there a slight crispness? Eh, more like a sharper creaminess. I wouldn't use the words \"sugar,\" \"honey,\" or \"crumbly\" to describe it either. If it were up to me, I'd call this flavor sweet and spiced with hints of soft graham. Despite the seemingly inaccurate description, this is an incredibly interesting flavor.\n\nWhen I first smelled the bottle, I was instantly reminded of cologne, and I was pretty turned off. There's a fairly strong, spicy, sandalwood scent that reminds me of a grandpa. I fully anticipated this to taste like a mixture of tree bark and cologne. A member from another forum recommended mixing EuroFlavor concentrates anywhere from 3-5%, so my first mix was at 3%.\n\nWhen vaping this, I immediately taste the spice, and there's definitely notes of graham present. It's difficult to pick out every individual spice, but I'm almost positive there's a combination of ginger and what seems to be cardamom. At times I thought I was picking up on clove and a really creamy nutmeg taste, but at other times it didn't seem to be as present. The graham sits more in the background and is very soft, almost like someone soaked pieces of it in heavy cream before adding it in. There's a very faint dark vanilla note that has an FA Vanilla (Madagascar) quality. After a two-week steep, the spiciness calms down, and the graham notes become more noticeable. Instead of spice with hints of graham, it's now more of a creamy graham with spices.\n\nMy next test was at 1% since I wanted to see how this would work as an accent. At this percentage, the graham really isn't that noticeable. On the shake, it's really more of a spicy ginger which turns into a soft spiced cream note after a week-ish steep. At 5%, this is relatively strong and has much more of the cologne vibe that I smelled when getting the concentrate. If you wanted to use this above 4%, it's going to take over the mix. The spices aren't going to be able to be covered up at all, but the graham will be sit more upfront after a long steep. Overall, I'd say this will work best at 0.5-1% as an accent, and I 'd use it around 3% if you wanted to feature it more prominently. Like any other mix, the percentage that you use is going to be dependent on the other flavors. This, however, is probably not going to mesh well with other stronger concentrates.\n\nIf you're looking for a generic, Honey Maid graham cracker, this isn't it. If you wanted to combine it with a drier flavor (like a biscuit), it could be bent in that direction, though. This would be an awesome accent for bakeries in general (pie crusts in particular), tobaccos, and I'd even recommend using it in conjunction with something like black tea for a chai-type mix. Of all the EuroFlavor concentrates I've tried, this is by far my favorite. It's complicated but somewhat versatile, and it could really push mixes into unusual but pleasant directions. If you're into bakeries and spices, I really think you'd benefit from having this in your arsenal. \n\n**Additional Note:** The cardamom note in the concentrate made me feel like this is a flavor that would do a great job in complimenting a citrus, so as a quick test, I mixed INW Shisha Lemon @ 1%, FA Vanilla (Madagascar) @ 1%, and EF Graham Cracker @ 3%. This ended up being pretty tasty! It's got a lemon meringue pie quality that I'll probably build off of at some point in the future, but I've just kinda enjoyed it as is for now.","author":"PepperMyJabrill","title":"Graham Cracker","url":"https://redd.it/9vva7a","vendor":{"name":"Euro Flavor","code":"EF"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"EF","title":"Graham Cracker"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
