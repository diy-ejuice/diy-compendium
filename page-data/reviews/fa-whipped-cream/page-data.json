By the looks of it, it's been out since at least 2010 according to the reviews on ECX. I thought I'd share my notes on them. Also, the only place I've seen that has it is ECX. Anyways, to me I'm getting some airy notes with an actual whipped cream flavor. It's almost like an unsweetened or lightly sweetened whipped cream, and has tasted well in everything I've tried it in. I've come to the conclusion that at about .5% it becomes slightly present, but at .7% (as high as I've tried), it becomes very tasty and pretty strong. It was my blueberry custard that I tried it at .7% though so it may be getting a little stronger because of custards/creams. I'd say if you wanted a perfect whipped cream flavor I'd throw in 2% TFA whipped cream or CaP vanilla whipped cream. It really reminds me of fresh cream in a way but it doesn't take over as much. I haven't checked the MSDS so I'm not sure if there's triacetin in this or not. I do suggest you guys check this out as I've been starting to use it in place of or with other whipped creams as I love the subtle layer of cream this adds. It truely tastes like whipped fresh cream.
