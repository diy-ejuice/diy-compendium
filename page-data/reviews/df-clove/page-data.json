[this is a clove tobacco flavor!](http://www.delosi.com/flavoring/tobacco/clove.html) but i find it to be mainly clove with almost no tobacco, similar to an RY4 being more caramel sweetness than tobacco.\n\n**Off-flavors:** none\n\n**Throat Hit:** low, if any.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:** this should pair well with apple, pear, and rhubarb flavors. tobacco can benefit from this to add another dimension or go for a clove cigarette. you can use this in pie profiles especially apple or pumpkin, for some extra tasty spice. this can even be useful for spiced beverage mixes (tea or spiced apple cider) there are many great pairings here, so much potential! try it with vanilla, cinnamon, or anise. maybe even clove ice cream?\n\n**Notes:** just incredibly tasty and versatile! 2-3% seems like a great place for this depending on what else you have in your mix. i feel like this will fade out if used much lower, and overpower if used higher.\n\n**Second Opinions:** Nicotine Labs recommends around 10-12% but i wouldnt do that if i was you... couldnt find anything else in terms of reviews or even blurbs, but as this was in the ATF awesome box im sure some people here have some things to say in the comments.","author":"PerennialPhilosopher","title":"Clove","url":"https://redd.it/61a02r","vendor":{"name":"Delosi Flavors","code":"DF"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"DF","title":"Clove"}},
