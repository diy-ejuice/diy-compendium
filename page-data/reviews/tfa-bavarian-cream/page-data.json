It's thick, dairy and vanilla mostly. The nuttiness goes away after a few hours.\n\nAt 5% the vanilla starts to take over and gains focus.\n\nAt 10% it gets really sweet, like sickening sweet. Even more vanilla. The other notes get kinda lost.\n\n##**Recommended Percentage and Steep:**##\n\nI would recommend 2-5% for standalone flavor and a medium steep (3 to 7 days).\n\n\n\n##**Toxicity**##\nVolatile | contains\n---|---\nAcetoin | x\nDiacetyl |  \nAcetyl Propionyl|  \n\n***\n\nMy testing setup:\nGriffin RTA, Dual Kanthal Coils reading at 0.5, 30 Watts.\n\nI make 3 10ml bottles (3mg nicotine, 50/50 PG VG) and steep them for 4 weeks. I test them after 1, 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days.","author":"SONDERvape","title":"Bavarian Cream","url":"https://redd.it/4nll4y","vendor":{"name":"The Flavor Apprentice","code":"TFA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"TFA","title":"Bavarian Cream"}},
