This is pretty true to its name. The caramel is very smooth and rich and there is a grainy note which would be the rice crispies. I am pleasantly surprised by the light sweet cinnamon note that you get on the tail end of the exhale. It isn't overpowering at all just a light bakery cinnamon that really does wonders for this mix.\n\n**Off-flavors:** No off flavors here, it is a pretty authentic flavor\n\n**Throat Hit:** Very easy on the throat, smooth exhale\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This could be a very good stand alone vape. I could also see this being used in bakeries as the grainy aspect would blend in perfectly and add a nice caramel and cinnamon flavor to any cookie, cake, or even custard or cream as it is not too grainy. \n\n**Notes:**\nThis flavor is very sweet. I think if you add just a touch of ap or tpa rice crunchies to better augment the grainy aspect you would have a very good dessert mix. The mouthfeel is nice and thick as well, almost like you can chew the rice crispy treat.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\nBeing as this is a fairly new company there isn't any other notes or reviews to help me out. Please if you have differing opinions leave a comment as I would love to get some other people's take on this flavor. More WF flavor reviews to come.\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"mlNikon","title":"Caramel Rice Crispy Treats","url":"https://redd.it/5mbcco","vendor":{"name":"Wonder Flavors","code":"WF"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"WF","title":"Caramel Rice Crispy Treats"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
