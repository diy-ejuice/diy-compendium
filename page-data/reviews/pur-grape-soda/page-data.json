Overly sweet, verging on grape candy like nerds but stops before getting that sweet tart chalkiness. No carbonation of course, but due to the nature of grape soda it doesn't have that emptiness that is prominent with flat soda.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:** None\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit:** 2/10\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Pairings:** Creams, vanillas, candy, tart and sour additives. Wine or champagne for carbonation if it really works?\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Notes:** Excellent base for a grape cream soda. Would be great with some fizz if anyone know the secret to simulating carbonation. Some people say wine or champagne flavors add that, but I haven't tried. Medium strength at 6%, I would recommend upping it to 8-9% for a single flavor or 4-6% in mixes to get that punch of flavor normally present with grape soda.","author":"mysticrosell","title":"Grape Soda","url":"https://redd.it/6s4rq2","vendor":{"name":"Purilum","code":"PUR"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"PUR","title":"Grape Soda"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
