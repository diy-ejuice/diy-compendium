Dual round wire coils @.15 ohm. 60W Power.  \n\n**Testing:** SC Grape @ 4%, 70/30 VG/PG, Steeped 1 week, tested at 1 day, 3 days, and one week.  \n\n**Flavor Description:** This is a very sweet, candy like grape. No sense of authentic fruit here. It reminds me of a blow pop without the gum center or a grape jolly rancher, although, not quite as sour as a jolly rancher. Very forward on the tongue.   \n\n**Off Flavors:** There were no discernible off flavors as far as I'm concerned at this percentage. The whole taste experience was just grape-y goodness.  \n\n**Throat HIt:** 2/10. This flavor is very smooth for a candy/fruit flavor  \n\n**Uses** I am really bad at this part a I don't have much creativity. This would be good in, well, a candy or bubblegum. It would also be good in some sort of grape cocktail as it is reminiscent of a cheap grape juice.  \n\n**Pairings:** Any bright, candy like fruits would be right at home with this flavor. I wouldn't use this in creams or bakeries unless you maybe used a touch of liquid amber with it to create a grape jam but in my opinion it is too much of a bright, candy-like grape to work where there are better grapes to use in bakeries.\n\n**Notes:** I tried this throughout the steeping process and although the flavor doesn't change much it does fade a tad so I would recommend using this flavor in shake and vapes or adding a touch more than you think you would need.  \n\n**Second Opinion:** Would love to give a second opinion but there doesn't seem to be much out there in the way of other notes so you'll just have to take my word for it that this shit is good lol.  \n\n[Other Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)","author":"mlNikon","title":"Grape","url":"https://redd.it/5dps5v","vendor":{"name":"Super Concentrated","code":"SC"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"SC","title":"Grape"}},
