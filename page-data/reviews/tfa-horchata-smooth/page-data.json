And a Crown Mini with a .25ohm SS coil at 40W.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**PG/VG:** 30/70\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Steep Time:** 2 Weeks\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Aroma:** Slightly perfumed vanilla, milk, sweetness, light spices maybe cinnamon and cardamom?\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Flavor Description:** Mildly sweet vanilla rice milk with a hint of cinnamon? This has a very authentic milky rice flavor with decent body. It's not as thick and creamy as whole milk or creamer, but similar to 2% milk and actually quite smooth. There's a medium strength natural vanilla that rides in the top notes enough to stay present throughout the entire vape. At first I thought this had more spices that I just couldn't distinguish, I was thinking nutmeg or cardamom. But the more I vape this, the cinnamon is a little different than I'm used to as well. It's doesn't taste the same as the commonly used cinnamon that is usually found in applesauce or mixed with sugar on toast, although that is there as well, but it's something more? I've never had Mexican cinnamon, but I'm wondering if this is it? Maybe if someone has had it and also tried this might be able to weigh in here? They have really done an excellent job with balance on this one. Even though cinnamon is a very pungent and dominant flavor, it's not too strong and doesn't bury the rice milk. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:** None\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit:** 5/10\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Pairings:** Cookies, cakes, cereal, creams, nuts, ice cream, butter, spices, tea, koolada, smoothies, shakes, peaches, mangos, other fruits that are good with cinnamon.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Notes:** I got this looking for a base to create rice pudding. I think this is going to work, but it's going to take a little finesse. Some are going to think this is a weak flavoring and I agree it is somewhat weak. When I first tried it I couldn't taste very much at all, just mild sweetness with a hint of spice. After 5 minutes of chain vaping, the flavor really developed quickly. And seemed to get better the more I vaped. I believe the heat of the sub ohm actually helped this one. Which leads me to believe it will get stronger with a longer steep. I will try to update at 4 weeks. I was surprised to find that I liked it as a single flavor ADV though, and enjoyed the break from \"in your face\" flavors. I may go up to 15% on the next one, but I am enjoying this as a SF. I have read on reviews and heard people say they like this as a single flavor at 20% as well. In a mix, I'm not really sure, but I'm going to guess at least 4-8% due to the weakness and mild flavor.","author":"mysticrosell","title":"Horchata Smooth","url":"https://redd.it/5s010c","vendor":{"name":"The Flavor Apprentice","code":"TFA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"TFA","title":"Horchata Smooth"}},
