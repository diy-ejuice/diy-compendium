Nothing like any other brands, and in a good way. I swear I'm tasting coconut and graham cracker? Vanilla stands out along with thick cream.  None of that sour feet yuck, not a hint. As of now I'm not really getting cheesecake either though, more like a velvety buttery cream coconut cream with graham crust. I am sure that will change with a longer steep as it's only been 5 days. Really surprised at how creamy it is in such a short time.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:** Coconut, goes away with steep.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit:** 2/10\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Pairings:** Most any fleshy fruit or berries, no citrus. Cookies, cakes, pastries, donuts, cheesecakes, creams, custards, nuts, caramel, butterscotch, chocolate, crust, peanut butter, vanillas.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Notes:** Comparing this to CAP NY Cheesecake? I can't. CAP has a tangy/sour, very lightly sweetened thick creaminess with a dryness to it. At this point I wouldn't even describe PUR as cheesecake. I would call it coconut cream pie w/graham crust. For at least the first week But I love it! Would I buy it...Yes, repeatedly. It's a very unique flavor that doesn't have anything similar from other manufacturers that I'm aware of. Will update after a longer steep.\n\n**EDIT:** The hint of coconut steeped out. It seems it was the note I was getting from the graham cracker at first that mellowed with time. I'm not sure at what week it went from being Coconut Pie to NY Cheesecake, but it happened. Two flavors in one, S&V is Coconut Pie with Graham crust. Then it turns into a wonderfully thick creamy tangy cheesecake with a more pronounced graham crust than CAP's.","author":"mysticrosell","title":"New York Cheesecake","url":"https://redd.it/5mx4lr","vendor":{"name":"Purilum","code":"PUR"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"PUR","title":"New York Cheesecake"}},
