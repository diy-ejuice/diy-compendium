    "result": {"data":{"reviewsJson":{"markdown":"**Setup:** Recoil w/ flavor barrel, Dual 15 wrap 26g 3mm Nifethal 70 coils @.15 ohms.  60w power, 450F temp limit. Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Peach Gummy @ 1% and 1 drop per 10 ml (about .25%), 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 8 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Peach rings, or at least most of the way there. Just a bit on the the astringent boozy side solo.  Soft candy peach with some light bitterness, and a full gummy base that's lacking some of the almost chewy density of a peach ring.  Obviously useful for peach rings, but also as an accent in candy mango, or thicker peach fillings in bakeries. Linear mixer, Use up to 3% as  primary flavor and around 1% as an accent.\n\nInhale is dense with a candy peach flavor. Some sharper tartness, but it's less noticeable as you increase the percentage.  Full gummy mouthfeel with some pretty tangible stickiness to it. Exhale has soft candy peach up front.  Not a ton of top notes, maybe a tiny bit of a bitter edge to it, no real floral component. Base is full, but not quite dense.  Sticky gummy mouthfeel. Candy sweetness, but not overwhelming at 3% and under.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Solo, this has a bit of a astringent note to it overall, pretty common with gummy flavors. Doesn't seem to show up when it's mix with heavier flavors though.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Light. It's not in the same universe as Juicy Peach.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This is fairly close to a standalone peach rings flavor, but a little help isn't a bad thing. In the second opinions there are references to mixing this with INW Peach, and I think that pairing would be great to really fill in the peach here. Also, for the gummy base, traditionally it's a bit thicker and chewier than something like a gummi bear, so I'd look at some TPA Marshmallow to thicken it up.\n\nOutside the obvious peach rings thing, I think this has potential to work in sweeter and thicker peach applications like peach bakeries and maybe even peaches and cream.\n\nCandy peaches and candy mango flavors have (for me at least) a lot of similarities, so I've used this to back up mango flavors in candies.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, this seems pretty linear. This is definitely present, but fairly thin and just a bit astringent down at .25%. .5% is largely the same, with maybe a bit fuller peach flavor and the astringency is closer to a gummi flavor. 1% has a pretty full peach flavor, with some gummy mouthfeel. Overall effect is still just a bit astringent and almost boozy.  1.5% is fuller, and I'm losing a good deal of that astringent edge but there is still a bit of bitterness. Peach feels even more candied and it's losing some tartness.  2% is sweeter, dense, and a bit flat. Definitely peach rings.  3% is getting a bit harsh and oversweet for me personally, but it's still pretty linear. 4% is getting harsh for me, and that peach is getting pretty indistinct and flat. I'd recommend using this a peach ring flavor with some backup at 3%, and as a backup to thicken other peach flavors anywhere between .5 and 1.5% depending on how thick and sweet you want that peach.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Here's a post by /u/Dwhoneil/ brings up using this in a peach rings flavor, with the aforementioned usage of INW Peach.  Some good description in peach rings in general down in the comments.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/576pqs/found_the_key_to_the_perfect_peach_gummyrings/)\n\n[Not a ton on the ELR Page. One note saying it's accurate to peach gummies, suggesting a 4.0% mix.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/108789)\n\n[Here's the Flavorah broduct page. Their description: \"Peach Gummy is an analog to our peach. Classic nectar peach notes are full and incorporate both flesh and skin of the fruit. Can be close to a peach-o candy. Peach Gummy is sans acetoin.\"](http://store.flavorah.com/concentrated-peach-gummy-flavor)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Peach Gummy","url":"https://redd.it/6cff4v","vendor":{"name":"Flavorah","code":"FLV"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FLV","title":"Peach Gummy"}},
