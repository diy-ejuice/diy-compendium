I hope it helps. These flavors really do need at least a 4 week steep to fully develop the flavors. VG just doesn't carry the flavor like PG. However, even using higher percentages, if they are single flavors it's not using any more flavoring than they usual 15-20% of combines flavors that is commonly used with a lot of flavoring. These are not super concentrated like INW or FA.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Cream Soda**\n- 10% @ 1 week steep. This is a very delicate flavor. Very good creamy vanilla, not as sweet as the real thing. Definitely not a stand alone at this percentage. Not in your face flavor. Would be great as a creamy vanilla in blends. Going to try at 15% and see what happens, maybe also with some sweetener. I like it, hoping higher percentage and steeping brings it out more. Unless it strengthens with higher percentages and steeping, I wouldn't use stand alone. Will update after further testing. Going to make an orange cream soda and see how it develops. That is what I wanted this flavor for.\n- At a 4 week steep. This flavor honestly surprised me. It had a huge change with steeping, strengthened a lot. Sweet vanilla dominant cream soda. In a tank I would raise to 15% for SF, and have actually changed my mind and would consider this for a stand alone depending on my mood. I am looking forward to playing around with this one.\n\n**UPDATE:**  Flavor fades after 6-8 weeks. Recommend making smaller batches or trying the SC.","author":"mysticrosell","title":"Cream Soda VG Version","url":"https://redd.it/4rh9lp","vendor":{"name":"Real Flavors","code":"RF"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"RF","title":"Cream Soda VG Version"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
