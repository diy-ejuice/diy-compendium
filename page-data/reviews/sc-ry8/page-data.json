Right off the shake and after a few days, there was a coffee note that was so powerful, so not good, that I experienced flavor rage. I don't know what I was expecting. I guess knowing that FE RY4 is kind of leafy and has the most tobacco-ish vibe out of all the ry4's I've ever tried, I kinda had high hopes that maybe this one would be the real All-In-One RY4 I been waiting for, like a real one shot ry4. This overwhelming amount of coffee in this, particularly that it tastes nearly the same as that Havana Dry gross sour coffee note to me is a real disappointment. No amount of sugar or caramel or tobacco or anything will make me like that flavor. I bet it will steep down into less unpleasant, used at a lower level I could see probably this being less offensive, and -- I don't know -- maybe it's one of those things that it is just me. I don't like that fake coffee note at all and I don't suspect this will ever go my way.  \n\nAfter about a week, this has mellowed out considerably. The coffee note is definitely not the only thing I taste and it's followed by some darker, sweeter possibly caramel, but that sour coffee note just sits right on top of it like a bully just pinning down our nerd hero in the school playground taunting it in some shitty afterschool special. After vaping a good 10mL or so, I kinda numbed to the taste a bit which helped, it was more like a pocket of ick than a whole lifetime of self hatred releasing the message in a bottle of self doubt saying, \"You deserve this\". In all, I'm comfortable saying this isn't for me.\n\n*Suggested percent:* I would never ever want to use this at 6% ever again, if at all. Possibly 2-4%?\n\n*Pairing ideas:* I don't really like RY4 that much to begin with. With the strong ass coffee note, I can only see this being used in my own mixes if I'm trying for a coffee-cookie-dessert tobacco type vape or with FLV CT Shade which could bully it into being a supporting note. Otherwise, I lack the imagination or inspiration to use this ever again.\n\n\n**Second Opinions:**\nFlavor Jungle's description:\n> If you like RY4, you'll love RY8. RY8 takes the best qualities of the original [RY4](https://flavorjungle.com/products/ry4-flavor-by-flavors-express \"RY4 Flavoring by Flavors Express (SC)\") and and [RY4 Double](https://flavorjungle.com/products/ry4-double-by-flavors-express?variant=17264213065786 \"RY4 Double by Flavors Express (SC)\") recipes and cranks them up to peak flavor. Delicious and earthy notes melt into sweet caramel and vanilla to make a symphony of flavor beloved by all.\n> \nThe sole reviewer on Flavor Jungle's website, John Mirsky says:\n\n>**RY8 Delicious**\n>Item is as stated in the description. My recipes come out better with your products.\n>Very nice and flavorful. I'm happy. Thank you.\n\n## Final Thoughts\nMeh, if you are a deep diver on RY4, you probably can't pass this up. Me? I'm happy to pass on this as I have a bazillion other flavors I don't use. This one just wasn't decent enough to warrant me trying to figure out how to make it work to my tastes. Knowing that FLV RY4 has a strong enough coffee note to play with, and that I still never seem to get the urge to, makes me think that really this is just not even an average coffee taste enough to warrant a second look, nor does coffee ry4 tempt me as a flavor overall. I'd rather some neutral tobacco, caramel, and MF Coffee (or nearly any other halfway decent coffee flavor) if that's what I want, and be on my merry way. Knowing that I tried this mtl and that coffee flavors are even better mtl makes me seriously doubt this will bode well for the usability of this flavor in my collection. Is it all bad? Nah, but I dont recommend finding out for yourself. I did fill half my squonk with this sample and some bacco blend I was working on which diluted the RY8 to 3%. It meshed better than I thought it would, but that coffee sourness just poked through too many times for me to ignore it, just kind of confirming my suspicion that I'll nope this one out.","author":"isuamadog","title":"RY8","url":"https://redd.it/ry3xul","vendor":{"name":"Super Concentrated","code":"SC"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"SC","title":"RY8"}},
