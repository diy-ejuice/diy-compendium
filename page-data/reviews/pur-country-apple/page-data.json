It is the same flavor though.**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Percentage Used:** 7%\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Equipment Used:**  Troll RDA with a wickless single SS .8 ohm Clapton wrapped parallel with 26g SS at 19W.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**PG/VG:** 30/70\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Steep Time:** 7 Weeks\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Aroma:** Strong, realistic apple, fresh, juicy, tangy, sour. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Flavor Description:**  This is a very good and unique apple as it tastes like it's been cooked. I can taste the sweet flesh of the apple, along with just a hint of rind. Natural realistic flavor, not crisp and sour. It does have the normal faint tanginess though. No spices or sugar, just slow simmered tender apple.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:** Slight peel.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit:** 2/10\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Pairings:** This is a great apple for bakeries, perfect for pie filling or apple danishes or dumplings. Most any fruit that pairs well with apple. Cookies, cakes, cereal, creams, custards, nuts, cinnamon, clove, maple, brown sugar, caramel.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Notes:**  Good strength for SF at 7-9%. 2-6% for blends.\n\nCompared to FA Fuji, this is much different. It's not as overwhelmingly dominant, so I can see it being much easier to work with in recipes. It is also missing that fresh tart crisp sharpness that is in FA's version. I think they are both very good, it just depends on what you are looking for in your recipe.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**EDIT: 1/26/2016. They have changed the name to Country Apple rather than Fuji. It is the same flavor though.**","author":"mysticrosell","title":"Country Apple","url":"https://redd.it/5mwwm9","vendor":{"name":"Purilum","code":"PUR"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"PUR","title":"Country Apple"}},
