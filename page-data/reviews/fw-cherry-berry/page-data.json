Anyhow, onto the important stuff.\n\n**Tested at:**     \n3% Single Flavor, approx 75% VG\n\n**Tested with:**    \nVandy Vape Paradox   \nsingle coil    \n3mm ID 6 wraps   \n4/32g flattened twisted SS316l   \n50watts\n\n**Initial Impression:**     \nThe smell is a dead ringer for a cherry popsicle brand ice pop, or cherry slush puppy syrup. Decidedly artificial, and candylike. At 3% shake and vape it’s not overpowering by any means, a bit weaker than I’d have expected. The flavor does follow the scent pretty accurately, though it sort of lacks body, not quite “wet” enough to make it a candy in and of itself. It’s actually quite reminiscent of a Luden’s cherry cough drop or a cherry lifesaver. I don’t get any strong medicinal or plasticy off notes at this stage, but it also isn’t quite sweet enough to muster a fully formed “candy” note on its own.\n\n**After a week:**      \nThings have become a bit more artificial, and a bit softer.That is allowing a bit of a waxy flavor/mouthfeel to come through. This is a very much still in the flavor profile of a Luden’s cough drop but it might be bordering on cherry wax lips or some form of store brand cherry starburst.\n\n**Off notes:**    \nNot so much “off” notes as it is just too thin to stand up on its own. After a week though, the slightly waxy note that becomes more noticeable is unfortunate.\n\n**Suggested pairings:**      \nThis flavor begs to have something behind it to sell either a syrupy iced drink or a hard candy. I can’t imagine using this with a cream unless you’re aiming for something odd like an alternate universe creme savers candy where they actually made a cherry flavor. I don’t think you could sell this into a black cherry ice cream, at least not without some serious help. Similarly, because this leans so heavily toward a candy flavor I can’t imagine it being particularly valuable for bakery or *most* tobacco applications. Maybe something of a Starbuzz style fanciful flavored shisha tobacco.\n\n**[DIY_Ejuice's list of flavor reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"Foment_life","title":"Cherry Berry","url":"https://redd.it/c22rll","vendor":{"name":"Flavor West","code":"FW"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FW","title":"Cherry Berry"}},
