Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Apple Filling @ 1% and 1 drop per 10ml (about .25%), 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 13 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Whole lot of bakery cinnamon with some apple filling in there. Definitely cinnamon forward. Cinnamon here tastes really similar to FLV Rich Cinnamon but a lot less aggressive at the same percentages.  The apple filling doesn't have a clear apple flavor, but a very commercial, gelatinous apple-esque filling you get in mcdonald's apple pies.  Warm and slightly sticky mouthfeel. Not overwhelmingly sweet for a pastry filling type of flavor.\n\nInhale has dominant, spicy bakery cinnamon.  Apple sweetness in there, but it's a lighter flavor on top of a heavy, dense vape.  Exhale is actually really similar to the inhale here. Spicy bakery cinnamon on top and that same light, super baked, apple flavor coming hrough underneath. Baked to the point of just being a vaguely apple sweetness. Not blindingly sweet, but sweet enough to pull off a filling fairly well. Mouthfeel is warm and gelatinous. Lingering stickiness on the lips.  Does the really commercial apple pie filling thing where it evokes apples as opposed to really tasting like them. The cinnamon here is aggressive and sticks with you for a bit.\n\n**Off Flavors:**  A lot of cinnamon for the amount of apple here. Doesn't really taste off, but out of balance.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Well, there's a good deal of cinnamon in here, so it definitely has a spice and bite to it. Nothing unexpected though.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  So yeah. Apple filling. It's still pretty cinnamon forward so you'll want to add a softer non-candy apple, but the mouthfeel and warmth here pulls off an apple filling pretty well.  Primary use will be apple pie and all of the myriad bastardizations thereof.  Also good for a baked apple base.  Apple is subtle enough that adding some pear flavor will pretty easily drag it into a baked pear.\n\nThis seems like an awesome pairing with a sweet, caramel RY4 tobacco. The relative mellowness of the apple and the gelatinous as opposed to juicy mouthfeel should complement a drier, spicy tobacco instead of just making the mix taste soggy.\n\nAlso reminds me of an apple pie moonshine I used to get from friends back in the day. I kind of want to put whiskey in this.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing,  I get almost no apple at .25% and .5%.  Just a light fruity sweetness, thick mouthfeel, and clear bakery cinnamon. .75% gets a bit more apple to it, but its still cinnamon dominant. 1% is even heavier on the cinnamon, but the warmth from the apple is starting to come through and the mouthfeel is doing a better job of pulling off a filling.  1.5% is about as heavy as I want the cinnamon, but the apple is still a bit weak.  I think the limiting factor for this concentrate is the strength of that cinnamon.  I'd recommend starting at .75% and adding another apple like Fuji or even better INW Two Apples to get a clear apple flavor.\n\nSeems more useful as a mouthfeel and warmth additive for an apple filling rather than a standalone apple filling, at least with the intended bakery uses.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Couple of notes on ELR.  User \"FPSpy\" reports this is really strong and mostly cinnamon: \"So powerful, no apple, but full of cinnamon... It is the cooked jelly part of apple pie as its name apple filling. Couldnt use more than %0.5 in any of my recipes... Cannot be used as a single flavour, apple + pie or cake needed. To me this flavor is not apple filling but cinnamon filling.\"  User \"Brian_SFL\" still comments on cinnamon but seems a bit more positive \"smells like mcdonald's apple pie filling. ... and after steeping it is awesome. (think it has rich cinnamon built in, but not too much.)\"](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/116172)\n\n[Here's the product page from Flavorah.  Their description: \"Grandmas' apple pie filling. Touch of cinnamon and sweet creamy baked apples. This is an excellent apple for any apple pie or baked apple flavor note. Strong and clear enough for a standalone.\"](http://store.flavorah.com/concentrated-apple-filling-flavor)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Apple Filling","url":"https://redd.it/63r8s0","vendor":{"name":"Flavorah","code":"FLV"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FLV","title":"Apple Filling"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
