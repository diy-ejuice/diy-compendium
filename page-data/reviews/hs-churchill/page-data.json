The tobacco is so light that it's nearly non-existent. I feel like this is never going to be a main ingredient in any of my mixes, but I could see it being useful in a tobacco mix to bring a unique sweetness without detracting from the tobacco profile. There is an almost bready quality to this that is difficult to place. /u/ConcreteRiver, I think this might make it into a sexy, sexy Italian fruitcake recipe! \n\nOff flavors:This has a very funky smell (like wet dogs rolled in a grass pile left outside to rot) but it doesn't seem to be tasteable, and it goes away after the bottle is opened a couple times. If you were expecting tobacco then the sweet, bready, dried fruits are an off taste.\n\nThroat hit: pretty mild even in a 50/50 mix, the smell kinda stings the nostrils\n\nUses and pairings: unique sweetener in tobacco mixes, dried fruit accent in bakeries, Ry4s, and possibly other uses (none come to mind)\n\nNotes: I think that 3% is a bit low for a standalone but perfect for use in a mix, I wouldn't go lower than 2% as this seems rather weak. I could see this being used up to 7% if you wanted to try something crazy. \n\nEdit: /u/chemicalburnvictim is doing a test at 5% and I'm hoping he will chime in on this thread","author":"PerennialPhilosopher","title":"Churchill","url":"https://redd.it/5nup3i","vendor":{"name":"Hangsen","code":"HS"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"HS","title":"Churchill"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
