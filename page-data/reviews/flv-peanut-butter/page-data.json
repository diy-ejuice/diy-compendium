    "result": {"data":{"reviewsJson":{"markdown":"**Setup:** Recoil w/ flavor barrel, Dual 15 wrap 26g 3mm Nifethal 70 coils @.17 ohms.  60w power, 450F temp limit. Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Peanut Butter @ 1.5%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 30 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Salty roasted valencia peanuts. In a way that's a whole lot better than that sounds. Decently fluffy, bordering on a bit grainy. Solid sweetness for a handful of peanuts, but undersweet for a peanut butter.\n\nInhale is moderately dense and suprisingly salty. Roasted peanuts on the beginning of the exhale. Sweetness seems pretty well integrated in the peanuts, more like Valencia peanuts than spanish or ballpark peanuts. Texturally, has some serious volume but not particularly smooth. That salt note comes back through and lingers on the tail end of the exhale.  FWIW, the exhale leaves the room smelling exactly like roasted peanuts.\n\n**Off-flavors:** At 1.5%, a light malt-liquorish note to that sweetness,  sort of tastes like dark roasted peanut skins but just a bit fermented. The salty note can come off a bit cheesy. It tastes a good deal like iodized table salt. I've never really had the goiter thing going on, so I switched to kosher/sea salt a long time ago and tend to notice when using normal table salt. Probably just thinking too much about it, but I can swear I can taste some iodine.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Light. A little harsh on the exhale.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:** I don't think it's worth trying to turn this into a smooth sweetened peanut butter. You need some serious extra cream and sugar, and that weird malt liquor / peanut skin twinge and iodine burn is going to be fairly distracting.\n\nThe actual peanut taste here should work better for like a trail-mix or crackerjack kind of recipe.  The texture here will also give you a lot of nice volume to play with.\n\nI'd also consider this with nuttier, drier bakeries. Should have a place if you are looking for a shortcake cookie kind of vibe.\n\nA nice textural element for sundaes.  Just S&V tasting, but this sits on top of VBIC really nicely.\n\nNuttiness, volume, and restrained sweetness would work well as a tobacco additive.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nPotent stuff here. S&V concentration testing, it's fairly prominent as low as .5%. You definitely get more of a general peanut impression and it's a bit creamier at a lower percentage. The roastier notes are less pronounced but the mouthfeel is still pretty nice. If you're intent on making a peanut butter out of this, I'd start down here. In general, .5% seems to be the place to start with mixing this. Once you push towards 1% the saltiness really picks up.  You can avoid most of the off-flavors and weirdness by staying under 1.25%. I'd use that 1% as a primary peanut note.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nFair amount of Reddit love [here,](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/3lgp4u/yet_another_flv_is_awesome_thread/) [here,](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/3kqbcp/to_assist_the_flavorah_recipe_thread_heres_some/) and [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/3lu03p/octavarium8s_flavorah_flv_tasting_notes_pt_1/)  Common thread is unsweetened natural peanut butter.\n\n[Suspiciously good notes on ELR.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/45498)\n\n[Whole lot of five-star reviews on Flavorah's website, mostly in the context of a peanut butter either solo, or as an roasted peanut additive.](http://store.flavorah.com/concentrated-peanut-butter-flavor)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Peanut Butter","url":"https://redd.it/5l6xoi","vendor":{"name":"Flavorah","code":"FLV"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FLV","title":"Peanut Butter"}},
