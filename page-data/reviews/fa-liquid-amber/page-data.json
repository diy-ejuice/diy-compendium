Very slight sweetness along with a decent sour note.  Also gives a bit of a warming sensation on the tongue.\n\n**Off-flavors:** The sour tartness might be off-putting, but I feel it is part of what the concentrate is.\n\n**Throat hit:** 6/10\n\n**Uses:**  Fermented accent to fruits @0.5-2%. Could also be used to add a sour note or tartness to a bakery/dessert recipe containing fruits.\n\n**Pairings:**  Mainly fruits.  Also cinnamon, caramel, or maybe brown sugar.\n\n**Notes:**   I have to say this isn't really comparable to FA Brandy as I've seen others state.  FA Liquid Amber is much more potent, sour, bitter, and gives a heavy fermented accent to a recipe, especially with fruits.  FA Brandy seems to be much sweeter and more creamy with a slight white/green fruit back note.  \n\nEDIT: [Link to all of our flavor reviews in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)","author":"wh1skeyk1ng","title":"Liquid Amber","url":"https://redd.it/4se9aa","vendor":{"name":"Flavour Art","code":"FA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FA","title":"Liquid Amber"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
