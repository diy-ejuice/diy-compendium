Shout out to Liquid Barn*\n\n**Setup:** Recoil w/ flavor barrel, Dual 15 wrap 26g 3mm Nifethal 70 coils @.14 ohms.  60w power, 450F temp limit. Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Liquid Barn Fresh Cream, 4 and 7%  @ 1g/ml, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 27 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  A cream base with a thinner top end.\n\nThe cream here tastes closer to a whipped cream than a fresh cream.  I'm not picking up any heavy realistic dairy notes.  It tastes a bit more light and buttery than fresh cream.  I am getting a hit of coconut out of this, similar to the coconut in TPA Cheesecake (Graham Crust).  It's not overwhelming or anything, but it definitely shows up as a solo flavor.  No vanilla or butryic cheesy notes though.\n\nI'm running into a lot of the same issues with this as I was with the normal [Liquid Barn Cream](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/7awr75/lb_cream/).  There's a decent, fairly rich base here with quite a bit of actual tactile richness all up in your mouth, but there's really no mid or top notes here.  And again, like the cream, I'm not willing to chalk it up to a lack of DAAP.  [On the datasheet for Fresh Cream] Liquid Barn states this 1,000ppm of Acetyl Propionyl... and while I'm by no means an expert that does definitely seem like it's enough to party.  That richer base doesn't really translate to a full, rich vape.  I'm still picking up a little bit of a weird raw vg sweetness to this up at the suggested 7%.  The texture on the top of the flavor is kind of thin and dry, even while you're getting that richer bottom end.  It's odd.  Also, it's a distinctly pink concentrate, which isn't a bad thing, but it's kind of interesting.\n\nComparing this to other fresh cream type flavors, this simultaneously feels a bit richer on the bottom end, but thinner everywhere else.  This also doesn't have much in the way of actual dairy notes compared to FA Fresh Cream or TPA/CAP sweet cream.  This also doesn't really have the body of any of the whipped cream flavors.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  A little bit of coconut here, but that's shouldn't really stick out when mixed. I taste raw vg sweetness in the top of the flavor.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  That thin and dry end is actually a little harsh.  Base is crazy smooth, but it dries out as the vape goes on.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 4% this is really thin at the top.  Some richer, buttery base but there just doesn't feel like there is much flavor and I'm just tasting my base on top of that.\n\nAt 7%, this is maybe a bit better, but I'm running into the same kind of issues.  The base is definitely present, but the top end is still relatively thin.  I'm getting more of a coconut vibe here as well.\n\nLiquid barn suggests mixing this at 7%, and that's probably okay with the caveat that it's more of a base for layering than a full flavor.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**   Pretty much the same as the normal LB Cream.  The thin top end of this means you're pretty much going to be using this as a base for brighter fruits and maybe some drier bakeries.  Would also work to add some DAAP hit to the bottom end of another milk or cream flavor.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Here's the ELR Page.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/67293)  User \"jojo\" writes: \"6% (SnV - Definitely a creamy mouthfeel, tiny bit sweet, slight coconut flavor. 1 week - same. No coconut anymore. 2 weeks - pretty much the same. Sweeter, and the coconut is back. 3 weeks - very sweet, still some coconut vibe, creamy feel. Itâ€™s really nice. 4 weeks - same. Less sweet and coconut. Nice.)\"  User \"lococarnage\" writes \"creamy mouthfeel. little flavor. good for base. smooth.\"\n\n[User \"Amy2\" has quick reviews up on the ELR Forum.  Her take: \"nice clean cream not added flavor works like a charm !\"](http://forum.e-liquid-recipes.com/t/liquid-barn-tasting-notes/66705)\n\n[Liquid Barn's product page.  Their description: \"Fresh Italian sweet cream. Excellent as a base for blending Liquid Barn fruit and dessert flavors.\"  It's a 56% VG flavor, and the suggested mixing percentage is 7%.](https://www.liquidbarn.com/products/fresh-cream-eliquid-extract)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Fresh Cream","url":"https://redd.it/7b3vlv","vendor":{"name":"Liquid Barn","code":"LB"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"LB","title":"Fresh Cream"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
