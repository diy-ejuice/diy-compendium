Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** INW Pear @ %1, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 17 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  So it's worth checking the second opinions right off the bat here, because my take seems to differ a bit from consensus.\n\nI get a realistic crisp asian pear flavor. A little bit of juicy body, a pretty prominent floral peel or skin note, and as close to a snap as I've got from a vape.  I get a fairly harsh vape from this, and I have a bit of trouble finding a percentage that has a strong enough flavor to read as a pear while keeping some of the earthiness and floral edge in check.  Overall, for me at least, it tastes more like a pear essence flavor you'd get in a vitamin water kind of beverage than an actual fruit, almost like a pear perfume.\n\nInhale is pretty airy, with some light pear sweetness. Exhale has a crispy, slightly gritty asian pear right up front which seems to fade out pretty quick. Some earthier peel top notes and a kind of hollow tasting back end. Not a lot of sweetness here, tasting undersweetened for something like a bartlett or anjou pear, but close to a underripe asian pear.  It's also a fairly light exhale for me, without much body past that initial burst of flavor.\n \n**Off-flavors:**  At lower percentages, I get some of the same muddy earthiness toward the back end of the vape that I get from INW Peach. If I start to push anywhere near 2% I also start getting a pretty pronounced floral edge.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Moderate. While the pear flavor in the concentrate has a bit of juice to it, I also get an odd, dry, throat hit. Increasing the percentage to try to find more juiciness here also increases that throat hit.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Personally, I'm sort of limited to using this at a lower percentage for more realistic top notes on a flatter, juicier flavor like FA Fuji or FA Pear.\n\nBased on the [publicly available ATF recipes,](https://alltheflavors.com/flavors/inawera-pear?original=true&owner=all&sort_order=new&suggestions=0)  this looks like it's being used either in conjunction with other pear flavors or in fairly busy recipes to push a bit of pear up to the front of a mix.\n\n**Notes:**  S&V Concentration testing, this is a bit weird. At .25% I get just a hint of that pear perfume kind of note without much body. At .5%, it's largely similar, but a rounder and less floral. At 1% I get a really good asian pear top notes, with a light sweet body. At 1.5% I get a solid hit of earthiness of the peel notes here. At 2% that earthiness is getting kind of floral and sharp. At 3%, this is reading way too floral for me.\n\nPersonally, I'm a bit bummed by this flavor. I think it has a good bit of utility in mixing, but it's going to need help as a full pear flavor.  Again, probably worth checking out the more positive takes here.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[The lastest FOTW Pear post, wherein /u/HocusKrokus drops science like Galileo dropped the orange:](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/5lrs24/life_without_it_is_almost_unpearable_this_weeks/)\n\n\"The king pear rears it’s fierce head. This pear is juicier than FA, and sweeter than both combined. It’s profile finds itself somewhere between a bright fresh pear and the syrup from a chilled can of pears. A very faint bit of the earthy backnotes I’ve found in TFA Pear, but much smoother. Mild throat hit if not mixed with another “juicy” flavor or cream. I find it a bit more potent than FA Pear, so I start at .25% as a supporting note, up to 2% in a mix, or 3% standalone. \"\n\n/u/Philosaphucker shares further in the comments:\n\n\"For a fleshed-out, saliva-inducing, juicy pear, I prefer to combine INW Pear with FA Pear in ratios that vary depending on the mix and my intentions (7:8, 1:1, 1:2, ect).\n\nIf I do not want pear to be at the forefront of my recipe, then I do NOT open INW Pear because it does not serve as a background flavor at all. One could even say that its floral nature can make it difficult to work with, but I have been pretty successful in pairing it with other heavy-hitting flavors (see Cactus @2%).\"\n\n[From the older FOTW:](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/3s4rad/flavor_of_the_week_pear/)\n\n/u/skiddlzninja/: \"I emplore everyone to try INW pear. It has the aroma and flavor of a fresh yellow pear, the truest pear flavor I've tried.\"\n\nA couple more measured takes, deleted user: \"holy fuck its wicked strong anywhere over 2%. So crisp it makes my teeth squeaky. I use it at .5% and its fresh and delicious but can't seem to get rid of that little bite/harshness that it has\" and /u/redhotmonkeyluv: \"Freshly mixed @ 3%, this is a slightly sweet pear with skin. It's lacking any base note. The heart note is light but pleasant and the top note is very nice - reminiscent of FA's Fuji. I can see this being easily overpowered in a mix. It works nicely with TFA's Pear at a 1:2 ratio with TFA filling out the bottom end that INW is lacking.\"\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Pear","url":"https://redd.it/5yxsv8","vendor":{"name":"Inawera","code":"INW"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"INW","title":"Pear"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
