Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FA Reggae Night, 1 and 2.5%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 9 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  A very fresh green flavor, a tiny bit on the dry side.  The whole \"reggae night\" thing is too cute by half, but this doesn't really taste anything like Marijuana, or at least anything like actually smoking it.  I get a pretty distinct juniper flavor right up front.  The actual juniper note tastes a lot like the juniper in FA Gin. There are some cucumber skin and fresh cut grass top notes to this.  The end result is very fresh tasting, differing from some of the heavier, warmer vegetal notes that end up tasting a bit swampy.  There is a bit of a warmer, camphourous pine note underneath it all, but it feels pretty well balanced and doesn't take away that much from the freshness of the flavor overall.  That pine note is the only part that really evokes the source material, it's just a hint of that piney, hops-esque skunky aroma.  I'd roll solo with this and a dash of cooling at 3%, or mix with bright, fresh citrus, mints, or cocktail flavors at 2%.\n\nInhale is mostly juniper. Medium dense, and just a bit dry.  Slight harshness and maybe just a hair sweeter than it needs to be. Does better at relatively lower temperatures where the sweetness isn't as pronounced. At higher temperatures manages to avoid that wilted, warm salad flavor that other herbaceous flavors can take on.   Exhale opens with that same clear juniper. Green, and fresh. Dry, leafy texture to it. Cucumber peel shows up in the top notes after. Splitting hairs, but seems a bit thicker and slightly bitter like a normal cucumber, and not the individually wrapped english variety that you eat with the skin on.  Has a fresh cut grass note to it as well. Almost like smelling a freshly cut crudite platter. Resinous pine undertone to this on the back half, a little warmer and sweeter. Well balanced flavor that seems to accent rather than dominate that fresher, herbal note. Pine lingers a bit on the finish.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Doesn't really match just a marijuana flavor. Also missing the heavy body odor of hanging out with the kind of stoners that would participate in said reggae night.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light.  It's a bit dry and leafy overall.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Shoutout to the randos wandering in occasionally asking about non-sweet flavors.  This isn't necessarily entirely bereft of sweetness, but it's a well balanced, green herbal and vegetal flavor.  So if that sounds like you're thing, go solo with this around 3% probably with just a hint of koolada, polar blast, or ws-23 to keep this fresh tasting and steer clear of a cooked vegetable flavor.\n\nPairing with this, that juniper note is really prominent.  This would make a good booster for a gin flavor and most of those other cucumber and grass notes aren't actually out of profile for a gin.  If you added this to TPA Champagne or FW Pink Champagne, it would actually make a good gin without using a gin concentrate.\n\nIn mixes, I think the best bet in using this would be a lot like you'd use a realistic cucumber flavor.  I'm thinking mints, basil, anise, and citrus.  I can even see stretching with this and pairing with fresher, brighter melons like honeydew.  You could even go crazy and aim for bright red fruits, but I've found that the pine part of this starts to stick out when mixed with anything too syrupy.\n\n**Notes:**  Seems pretty linear. At .5%, it's light but the pine undertone seems a bit more prominent at higher concentration.  At 1%, The juniper is starting to hit.  Tastes like light juniper and a noticeable pine. At 1.5% the more complex, slightly bitter cucumber peel is starting to move forward. 2% is getting a bit grassy, but grassy in a good way. More freshly cut grass than the harsher acetone note from green apples. At 2.5% The pine is sitting pretty comfortably at the back of the flavor. At 3%, this is seems pretty well balanced. I get a clear juniper up front, fresh green top notes, and just enough warmer, thicker pine to keep it from tasting thin or soapy. At 4% this seems a bit much.  There's a bitterness to the top notes and it may be too green.  I'd use this at 3% for a primary flavor with cooling and between 1.5 and 2% as an accent.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[3 stars all around at ECX.  User \"Logan\" writes: \"It has a freshly cut fescue grass taste/odor, so by itself is not very... Accurate. However I could see this part of some type of blend. For some strange reason, mine turned white and cloudy some time after having it, and I don't consider it safe for use any more. Not sure if it is the liquid itself or if it dissolved some of the plastic, though that doesn't seem likely.\"  I haven't heard of this flavor turning opaque yet, but it does apparently tend to turn your mixes slightly blue.  Maybe stick to glass on this one.](http://www.ecigexpress.com/diy-e-liquid/diy-e-liquid-flavors/flavourart-usa/flavourart-floral-flavors/reggae-night-by-flavourart-11317.html)\n\n[Reddit post about looking for something that actually hits the profile.
