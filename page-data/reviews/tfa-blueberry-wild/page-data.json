Not tart.  Almost feels powdery on the tongue.  Rather weak at 3%, but definitely noticeable.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  May seem perfumey at higher percentages, typically goes away after a 2-3 day steep.\n\n**Throat hit:** 1/10 very smooth almost no throat hit \n\n**Uses:**   Desserts, bakeries.  I've used this in recipes as high as 8-10% without muting or over-powering, but can attain desired flavor at 3-4%.\n\n**Pairings:** Vanillas, light creams, cheesecake, other berry-type fruits.  Use 3:1 or 4:1 with FA Bilberry, TFA Blueberry Extra, or CAP Blueberry for added tartness.  Would also work with some tobacco pairings.\n\n**Notes:**   Can easily be over-powered by stronger fruit concentrates, so when using it with something like TFA Blackberry or INW Raspberry, I would try to keep them under 1.5%.  I also highly recommend an additive listed above to round out the taste, but it is a really decent blueberry flavor by itself.\n\nEDIT: [Link to all of our flavor reviews in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)","author":"wh1skeyk1ng","title":"Blueberry Wild","url":"https://redd.it/4qcwxe","vendor":{"name":"The Flavor Apprentice","code":"TFA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"TFA","title":"Blueberry Wild"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
