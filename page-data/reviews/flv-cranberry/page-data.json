Like an unsweetened cranberry juice without the body. Hints of rind and berry topnotes. A bit earthy. Tastes mostly natural but missing some elements of a full cranberry flavor.\n\n\n**Relatable Flavors**\n\n\nA tart cranberry skin or dry cranberry juice flavor. \n\n\n**Off Flavors**\n\n\nThis flavor has a bit of a funky aftertaste and is very bitter at this percentage. The earthy/rind flavor might not play well with some recipes. \n\n\n**Position In The Recipe**\n\n\nThis flavor seems like it would work well at a lower percentage as a cranberry topnote or to add a little tartness or bitter quality. Not a good standalone flavor and would require additional cranberry or fruit flavorings to round it out. \n\n\n**Pairings**\n\n\nOther cranberries, stone fruits, nuts, orange, citrus, vanilla, and possibly creams.\n\n\n**Recipes**\n\n\nI haven’t tried any of these but there are a few on [ELR](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/60216) \n\n\n**Notes**\n\n\nSome have reported plasticy taste before aging and improved flavor with longer aging times. Will try this again after it has aged further. At ten days it doesn’t provide the cranberry bliss bar type of cranberry flavor I’m looking for, but it might be a nice accent to another cranberry flavor and would be good for anything that needs a little bite on the mouthfeel. If you are looking for a craisin, this isn’t it.  \n\n\n**Purchasing Information**\n\n\n[Flavorah Online Store](http://store.flavorah.com/concentrated-cranberry-flavor)\n\n\n[Bull City Vapor](http://www.bullcityvapor.com/cranberry-flv/)\n\n\nPrice: \n\n\n$5.49/15mL\n\n\n$22.92/120mL\n\n\n**Rating** *35/100* \n\n\nIf you disagree, well that’s just like, your opinion man. \n","author":"ClaptonBurns","title":"Cranberry","url":"https://redd.it/4umtq1","vendor":{"name":"Flavorah","code":"FLV"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FLV","title":"Cranberry"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
