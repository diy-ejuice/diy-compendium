Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Vape Train Honey Pomelo, 3% and 7%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 21 days.\n**Flavor Description:**  Like a pomelo, but sweeter.\n\nThe pomelo here seems fairly accurate overall.  Starts off as a sweeter take on a white grapefruit, with some moderately aggressive lime notes creeping into the top end on the exhale.  The body of the flavor is heavy and sweet, bordering on syrupy.  Gets maybe a bit oversweet and cloying solo, but it’s balanced fairly well by some tartness.  Not as tart as something like INW White Grapefruit or FA Grapefruit for me, but there is enough acidity to do the citrus thing well enough. I’m not really picking up anything too bitter here, but there is just a bit of a zest note going on as well.\n\nDoesn’t have that really heavy waxy note I usually get with thicker citrus flavors, so that’s cool. Overall, harshness is pretty decent for a ctirus. Base of the flavor feels more candied than juicy, and that sweetness can get a bit dry with extended vaping.  Something about the combination of lime and grapefruit can come across a bit like a cleaning product though, at least at higher percentages.\n\nThe only other pomelo flavor I’ve tried is Purilum Pomelo, and this seems to be a bit more useful.  I’d almost call the Purilum a bit more realistic, but this is brighter, fuller, and doesn’t have the weird musk of the Purilum.\n\n**Off-Flavors:**  Can get a bit of a cleaning product vibe solo, but pomelos kind of have that going on.  So not really?\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light to Moderate.  It’s there, but it’s relatively mellow for a citrus that is actually bright.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 3%, this is a bright, lighter take on a sweet citrus.  Doesn’t really read distinctly as a pomelo here, feels a bit more like a more generic citrus mix.  Not particularly harsh while still being fairly vibrant.\n\nAt 7%, this is a pomelo.  Something about the component citrus parts has cohered a bit and I’m getting a clear pomelo.   Still not super harsh, a touch acidic, and pretty bright overall.  Feels sweet and saturated, although it’s starting to taste a bit like a cleaning product.\n\nVape Train suggests mixing with this at 2-4%, and solo from 5-7%.  That actually seems about right.  Just based on these tests, I think I’d be around 1-2% as an accent or 5-6% as a primary note.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  As an accent, this is going to be a pretty good general purpose citrus that has some sweetness, body, and brightness.  Should stand up well in most fruit mixes and work as “citrus” to play off most anything you want to bounce off of it.  \n\nSeems the most like a grapefruit, so you may be able to use it in conjunction with a more zest heavy grapefruit to fill out a grapefruit vape without the overall mix being super aggressive.\n\nAt higher percentages, it’s a strong and relatively clean citrus flavor, but it’s a bit harder to get away from that industrial vibe.  As a primary flavor, I’d aim more at beverages or candies, where those lime notes aren’t going to drag a mix into tasting like cleaning products.\n\nI’d probably stay away from anything dairy-ish just because of those vaguely astringent lime notes going on in the top end.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  [One note on ELR from user “ChrisBeanColes” who writes: “Wonderful flavour. Can taste elements of many citrus fruits in one. Grapefruit, lime lemon. Hard to explain. Very tasty, no citrus harshness and no cloudiness to the liquid. Had steeped 11 days before I tried it as I'd mixed a lot of single flavour testers. Have only mixed at 6% so far. Would not need to go higher as a single flavour. Could probably go lower. Seems a fairly sweet flavour without being a sugar lips. Will see a lot of use I think.”](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/198482)\n\n[Here’s the product page from Vape Train.  Their description: “a delicious citrus fruit that is similar to grapefruit without the bitterness or sour flavour. Honey Pomelo pairs with lime, coconut and pomegranate and other citrus fruits. You could also make use of this in your cold beverage range and cocktail style liquids for making pink lemonade or adding to any ejuice recipes that require an uplifting freshness of flavour. This flavour also works perfectly on its own in a single profile mix.”](https://www.vapetrain.com.au/shop/vt-concentrates/honey-pomelo-flavour-concentrate-diy-for-e-juice-recipe/)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Honey Pomelo","url":"https://redd.it/8gg1en","vendor":{"name":"Vape Train Australia","code":"VTA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"VTA","title":"Honey Pomelo"}},
