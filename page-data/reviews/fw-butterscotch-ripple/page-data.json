Sweet, creamy, butterscotchy butterscotch. Super creamy. Almost like a butterscotch ice cream. Creamy to a fault in my opinion. So creamy it needs another butterscotch or caramel to really tone it in to a nice butterscotch. I feel like this is an essential flavoring to an arsenal, especially if you like butterscotch and super decadent desserts. \n\n**On the Nose**  \nOrgasmic. Just f'in awesome butterscotch.\n\n**Recommended Usage**  \n*Stand alone*: 5-8%\n\n*In a mix*: 2-4%\n\n**Throat**  \nMild\n\n**Pairings**  \nCaramel, other butterscotches, creams, nuts, coffee, tobacco\n\n**Avoid**  \nBright fruits, citrus\n\n**Steep**  \n3-4 days\n\n**Quick Recipe: Butterscotch Banana Frozen Custard**  \n*Ratio: 20G/80VG*  \n*Steep: 1 week* \n\n* TFA Banan Cream @ 4%  \n* FLV Butterscotch @ 2%  \n* FW Butterscotch Ripple @ 3%  \n* CAP Vanilla Custard v1 @ 2%  \n* TFA Vanilla Bean Ice Cream @ 3%  \n* HS Banana @ 0.75%   \n\nFW Butterscotch makes this recipe super decadent and is definitely a part of the main profile, but without the FLV Butterscotch it's a bit too creamy and not quite as butterscotch forward as you want it to be. To anyone who wants to mix this up and doesn't have HS Banana, you can try upping the Banana Cream, subbing for FA Banana @ 1-1.25%, or just leaving it out; all it does is bring the banana more forward\n\n##**[Bonus Recipe: Pistachio RY4-U](http://diyordievaping.com/2016/03/04/the-new-pistachio-ry4u-recipe/)** by /u/ENYAWREKLAW  \n*Ratio: 30PG/70VG*  \n*Steep: 1 week MINIMUM; 2-3 Weeks for full development* \n\n* TFA Pistachio @ 2%  \n* TFA RY4 Double @ 3%  \n* TFA Vanilla Swirl @ 3%  \n* CAP Sugar Cookie @ 4%  \n* FW Butterscotch Ripple @ 3%  \n* TFA Sweetener @ 0.5%  \n\nThis recipe introduced the world (ok, maybe not the world, but certainly me and probably a lot of other people) to the glories of FW Butterscotch Ripple. IMO this is a damn near perfect application of FW Butterscotch Ripple. It accents all of the flavors perfectly, lends some creaminess and sweetness, and just is f'in awesome.  \n\nFor anyone interested, **[ECX offers a pre-made concentrate of this recipe](http://www.ecigexpress.com/shop/diy-e-liquid/diyordie-concentrates/stacio-ry4u-30ml.html)**, so literally all you need to do is add in 15.5% of the concentrate, add nic (if desired), add PG, add VG, and you're off to the races.","author":"CheebaSteeba","title":"Butterscotch Ripple","url":"https://redd.it/4q2fc4","vendor":{"name":"Flavor West","code":"FW"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FW","title":"Butterscotch Ripple"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
