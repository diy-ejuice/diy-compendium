Due to there isn't any notes, thought I'd attempt to give it a go.  \n\nAll tests are mixed at the recommended percentages from LiquidBarn's site.\n\n**Setup**: Derringer, 24g 8 wrap .63 ohm, 45w, 1/2 wick\n\n**Testing**: Rainbow Sherbet, 8%, 60/40 vg/pg, Steep 5 days\n\n**Flavor Description**: Very light, like really light. There is some cream to it, though it's more of a freezepop icy than ice cream. This is more of the orange / blue variant of sherbet. Mainly the orange part. I know it's all around the same flavor, just different color, but I get the feeling of orange, not the flavor but the color. There is a hint of blue, whatever that is, on the back of the exhale. Light sweetness not from the flavor, but the VG. The first few drags tasted like straight VG. \n\n**Off-flavors**: This comes as a mainly VG based solution, 85/15, so the taste of VG is quite present.  \n\n**Throat Hit**: None, very light and smooth.\n\n**Uses & Pairings**: Creams definite, it needs something to bring out the texture and give it volume. Some bakery type flavors maybe? I am not sure what sherbet can be used in other than just eaten straight from the container.\n\n**Notes**: Could be the fact I used a single coil, but this left me pretty disappointed. The overpowering VG made me wonder if I was even doing this right. It's my first attempt at single flavor testing.\n\nMy brother made a sherbet recipe the first day we got everything. He says he can taste it more, since the recipe is also used with other LiquidBarn flavorings, so makes me think a cream base is needed for Rainbow Sherbet to really shine.  \n\n**Recipe**  \nLB Rainbow Sherbet - 8%  \nLB Vanilla Bean Ice Cream - 5%  \nLB Cream - 2%\n\nNot bad for a first attempt for someone who didn't have any knowledge of how mixing works, just knowing he needed an overall percentage. If I remember right, it's a close representation of what a spoonful of sherbet is.
