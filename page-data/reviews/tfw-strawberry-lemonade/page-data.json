It's not too heavy or coyingly lemon, but not too light. The strawberries are light and refreshing and don't overpower the fresh squeezed lemon. Sit under the porch, in the shade and enjoy this vape with your lemonade. You won't be disappointed. \n\nGood by itself or:\nMixes with:\n\nFruits: Definitely more strawberry, blackberries, black currants, pear, perhaps apples (think tart?), lemons, limes, citrus with zest.\n\nVanilla: Lightly, something to simply accent the flavor.\n\nCreams: Again lightly, possibly fresh cream or anything with a light body, if you get into vienna or things with fluff it might get too much texture. Think milky/cream style.\n\nAlcohol: You might be surprised here. Gin or vodka could go quite well with this flavor. Any juniper berries.\n\nAdditives: Play around with the cool effect as it could be quite interesting. Whichever you prefer. Start light and add to taste. Sweetener if you like really sweet, but it is pretty balanced as it is. \n\nFinish notes: All in all a really good flavor. A very balanced and good all day vape. Keep this in your collection of must haves. \n\n\n\n","author":"Boogenshizzle","title":"Strawberry Lemonade","url":"https://redd.it/6a0oyh","vendor":{"name":"The Flavor Wizard","code":"TFW"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"TFW","title":"Strawberry Lemonade"}},
