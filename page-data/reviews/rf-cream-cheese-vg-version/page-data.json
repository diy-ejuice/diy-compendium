If anyone knows anything I should do differently feel free to let me know. I promise I won't cry ;) Maybe...lol\n\n&nbsp;\n\nPlease understand these are just my opinions, and I have only been mixing for about 8 months. I hope it helps. These flavors really do need at least a 4 week steep to fully develop the flavors. VG just doesn't carry the flavor like PG. However, even using higher percentages, if they are single flavors it's not using any more flavoring than they usual 15-20% of combines flavors that is commonly used with a lot of flavoring. These are not super concentrated like INW or FA.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Cream Cheese**\n\n- Used 10% @ 1 week steep. This flavor really surprised me. Actually quite good, and strong flavor even at only a 1 week steep. Unusual for creams. Pretty authentic flavor, slightly tangy but still slightly sweet, doesn't have that flatness that you usually get from cream cheese. Sweeter than plain cream cheese, but like the natural sweetness of VG, not like a frosting sweet. I really like this, and I will be using it in a lot of recipes I'm sure. I'm thinking 3-6% in a mix. However, might lower that depending on how much it continues to strengthen with steeping. I won't be using this stand alone, not because it's a bad flavor, but because I don't care for just eating plain cream cheese. It's an accent flavor for me.\n- At a 4 week steep. First impressions were correct on this one. Became much stronger and more tangy with steep. Strong cheese flavor that will overpower if not careful. Due to how much it intensified with steeping, I am thinking .25-1% in mixes.","author":"mysticrosell","title":"Cream Cheese VG Version","url":"https://redd.it/4rhb06","vendor":{"name":"Real Flavors","code":"RF"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"RF","title":"Cream Cheese VG Version"}},
