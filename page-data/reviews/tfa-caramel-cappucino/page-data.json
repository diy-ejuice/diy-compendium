Slight creaminess.\n\n**Flavor Properties**- Robust strong coffee notes with a rich caramel undertones. This has an almost charcoal-roast bean taste to it.\n\n**Relatable Flavors** - Like taking a sip of your favourite Starbuck's Caramel Cappuccino. \n\n**Off Flavors** - This is a very potent flavor. Rule of thumb is 1 or 2 drops per 10ml. For me, I like my coffee strong with extra shots. So I went with 2 drops and it didn't impart any burnt taste like other coffee flavorings.\n\n**Position In The Recipe** - This is one of those flavours that could work as a base in small respectable amounts. You could totally make a smooth, creamy caramel cappuccino (refer to recipe below)\n\n**Pairings** - cream, tobacco, bakery, cakes\n\n**End notes** - If you like coffee, you will like this. This flavoring gets a lot of shit because people use it at absurb percentages. It's a really potent flavoring that can be tamed with creams and vanillas to produce a really tasty coffee vape. I urge you guys to try it out if you are a fan of robust coffees. I definitely consider this one of, if not the best TFA coffee flavoring out there!\n\nAdditional recipe courtesy of Vapor Trails NW:\n\n**Kool Beans!**\n\n2 drops Caramel Cappuccino (TFA)\n\n3% Vanilla Swirl (TFA)\n\n3% Sweet Cream (TFA)\n\n2% Caramel Candy (TFA)\n\n3 drops per 10 ml Koolada","author":"thedirtyprojector","title":"Caramel Cappucino","url":"https://redd.it/50m2q1","vendor":{"name":"The Flavor Apprentice","code":"TFA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"TFA","title":"Caramel Cappucino"}},
