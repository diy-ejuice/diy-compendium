Simple and delicious.  \n\n* **ACCURACY :** &nbsp; &#128308; &#128308; &#128308; &#128308; &#128308; &nbsp; EXACTLY LIKE THE DESCRIPTION  \n\n----------  \n**&#128313; Flavor Description &#128313;**  \nThis is a smooth, full-bodied vanilla sauce wrapped in a creamy coconut. This is not just any creamy coconut, but precisely this soft, creamy part of the coconut between the pulp and the coconut water. On a higher percentage, I could get a hint of the pulp on the exhale. Being not the coconut guy I enjoyed this and had to go through 3 testers to finally be sure that there are no changes after two weeks. Yes, the first two testers were finished just within days.\nThis is already a great off-the-shake.\n\n  \n\n**&#128313; Comments &#128313;**  \nThis concentrate is available at Bull City Flavors or directly at Gremberry Farms. Recommended usage is 15%-20% and it settled nice for me at 15%. SessionDrummer, who posts regularly at ELR, tested it at 13% and was very satisfied at that percentage.","author":"Steve-TC","title":"Creamy Coconut","url":"https://redd.it/rhhm3u","vendor":{"name":"Gremberry Farms Solo's","code":"GRM"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"GRM","title":"Creamy Coconut"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
