Not as dense as I was expecting but still up there 8 out of 10.\n\n**Throat Hit**2/10\n\n**Flavor Properties**\n\nA creamy Rich smooth butter flavoring. I feel like I'm gaining weight just trying this out,  the cream comes off perfectly balanced with the fat, a hint of sweetness. Definitely taste like  cow's milk butter and taste like right out of the churn.\n\n\n**Relatable Flavors**\n\nHello butter!!!!  Doesn't come off as movie theater style butter, more of the stick of butter when would you use for baking or cooking, even reminds me of clarified butter. \n\n**Off flavors**\n\nI am truly shocked, finding no off flavors other than that lingering aftertaste, and noticed at higher wattages aftertaste gets a little worse. \n\n**Position In The Recipe**\n\nBase note or accent,  this flavoring could easily be built upon, and used to Accent or push forward buttery notes in custards and cookies. I'm actually enjoying it as a standalone which is weird.\n\n**Pairings**\n\nCustard's and creams,  desserts, tobacco's, coffee's, chocolates, candies, and nuts along with most Fruit and Berry flavorings.\n\n**Recipe**\n\nI definitely something fantastic coming soon, and finally found what I feel is the key ingredient. \n\n**Notes**\n\nHere is some additional information on butter, if you don't already know everything about butter go ahead and take a look along with where to find it.\n\n http://www.bullcityvapor.com/butter-tfa/\n\n https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butter\n\n**Rating** 95/100\n\n*Please if your opinion differs, or you have another review for this post it in the comments.
