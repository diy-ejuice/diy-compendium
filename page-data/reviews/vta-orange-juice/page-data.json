Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Vape Train Orange Juice, 3% and 7%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 21 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  A tart tropical fruit smoothie? More acidic than orange.\n\nThe citrus here is mostly represented by the tartness.  It has a bright, intense acidity to it.  I think that part fits with the orange juice profile. Anything over 2 weeks is usually enough to knock out any acidity that’s going to readily fade, and it’s definitely hanging in there.  The more I vape this, the more orange I’m finding behind that citrus.  It’s not prominent to really come across like an orange juice, but there are some sharper orange zest type accents stuck in there.\n\nThe body of the flavor doesn’t do orange for me.  Tastes somewhere between a green banana like FA Banana and an artificial, dry mango like TPA Phillipine Mango.  Overall effect is sort of like a fruit smoothie.  You have that orange tartness, but I’m missing an orange juice thickness or an overwhelming orange flavor.\n\nModerately full texture overall.  That tartness makes it a bit aggressive, but there is a bit of thickness underneath there.  Doesn’t have that strangely thick texture of an actual orange juice. Sweetness level overall seems about appropriate for something based on fruit.  Not too aggressively sweet or candied.\n\nAs far as orange juices go, this seems to lag behind a bit.  WF SC Orange Juice hits the acidity and the orange fairly well.  FA Royal Orange is warmer and waxier, and lacking the clear acidity, but it tastes quite a bit more like oranges than this does.\n\n**Off-Flavors:**  Banana and mango in the body.  Tropical fruit smoothie kind of vibe instead of straight orange juice.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Moderate, but that’s mostly from the tartness here.  Doesn’t feel out of line for an orange juice concentrate.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 3%,  I’m mostly getting tartness and a sort of indistinct fruit background.  The orange isn’t really present aside from the tartness.\n\nAt 7%,  pretty aggressively tart, and I do get a bit of discrete orange.  The sort of fruity background is getting a bit more definition to it, and I can pick out the green banana and underripe mango.  Moderately dense and sweet, but not crazy thick or candied.\n\nVape Train suggests mixing with this at 2-4%, standalone at 5-12%.  Just based on these tests, I’d be mixing with this primarily as an additive or modifier around 2-3%.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I’m not sure I’d be reaching for this as an orange juice per se, at least in a profile where I would need a clear orange.  While the tartness from orange juice is there, I’m not getting much orange flavor and this is dragging along a lot of other fruit baggage with it.\n\nThis already reminds me quite a bit of fruit smoothie, I’d use it like an orange smoothie type additive paired up against fruits.  There’s already some green banana in here, would probably work up against a more artificial banana like tpa banana cream to give a fairly full banana without being too overtly runty.  As for the mango, it could probably filled out with something like FLV Mango or your personal non gross mango of choice.  Outside of just reinforcing some of the stuff already in here, it would probably go well with pineapple, coconut, or even strawberry.  Or double down on citrus and throw a flavor like FA Blood Orange in there and let the tartness carry it. \n\nI wouldn’t even be opposed to working some cream into this.  Actually feels like you get close-ish to an  orange julius type vape with another bolder orange right down the middle.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  Not really anything, via the google.\n\n[Here’s the product page from Vape Train.
