Moderately dense give it 4 out of 10.  \n\n**Throat Hit**- Slight 2/10                 \n\n**Flavor Properties**- Cereal like blueberry with a sweet tart snap.\n\n**Relatable Flavors**- Blueberry pancake syrup, reminds me of Boo Berry cereal.     \n      \n**Off Flavors**- Pretty decent flavor not extremely authentic, but may be much more useful giving authentic blueberry needs a lot of help.\n\n**Position In The Recipe**- This should work well in any fruit base that you were thinking of using blueberry, or a top note in cream basis.\n\n**Pairings**- Dark berries, fruits, bakeries, spices such as cinnamon, creams, and may also work well with tobacco's.\n\n*Please if your opinion differs, or you have another review for this post it in the comments. Will help the master list with multiple reviews in one spot.*","author":"Chrisdvr1","title":"Blueberry Extra","url":"https://redd.it/4ozpms","vendor":{"name":"The Flavor Apprentice","code":"TFA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"TFA","title":"Blueberry Extra"}},
