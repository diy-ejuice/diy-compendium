Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Jungle Flavors Fresh Cream, 1 and 4%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 16 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Accurate, smooth cream, a whole lot like the FA Version.\n\nPretty spot on to a heavy-ish cream flavor.  Light buttery note but no butyric or really heavy dairy flavors.  Some light tartness, but it's mostly from the bottom heavy nature of the flavor.  Doesn't really seem to be interacting with the flavor, I think I'm mostly just tasting my testing base.  Doesn't come across as crazy rich or thick, utility cream without any weirdness or off-flavors.\n\nSmooth mouthfeel and a flatter texture. Basically no top notes, and a moderately thick middle and base to the flavor.  Doesn't cross into a fluffier whipped cream.  Just a touch sweeter than straight cream, but doesn't have any heavy artificial feeling sweetness.\n\nSo if you put this side by side with FA Fresh Cream I'd really have trouble telling the difference.  The flavor here is really similar.  I'd say the JF version is just a hair more tart, but that could easily be my older bottle of FA.  Texture-wise, again, it feels pretty identical.  I think the middle of the FA is maybe a touch thicker but the base is pretty indistinguishable.  I think the primary difference is going to be the concentration, it feels like FA is just a bit more concentrated.  All of these differences could easily be explained by age of the concentrate or even how tightly the bottles seal.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Nah, not really.  Using FA as a benchmark, nothing that doesn't belong in there.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Nah, not really.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  Not a great solo vape, but at 1% I'm getting a light, flat cream flavor.  Not a lot of sweetness, and just a bit of body.  Mouthfeel still feels just a bit thin.\n\nAt 4%, quite a bit more volume and I'm getting light buttery notes.  Still nothing that tastes particularly butryic to me. Still feels pretty flat.  Seems to be drying out just a bit.\n\nJust given these tests, I'd probably be around 1.5% as an accent, and 3% as primary flavor.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This is about as close to a direct sub for a flavor as I've tested from different manufacturers, so this would basically slot in any recipe with FA Fresh Cream at basically the same percentage if not a touch more.\n\nPretty versatile overall.  Useful for a milk type base without any of the more aggressive dairy notes present in some of the milk flavors.  Mellow enough to not really stand out at low percentages against drier profiles while smoothing things out.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  Again, I'm not finding much out there.\n\n[Here's the product page from ECX.](http://www.ecigexpress.com/shop/diy-e-liquid/diy-e-liquid-flavors/jungle-flavors/fresh-cream-by-jungle-flavors.html)  Their description: \"Fresh Cream from Jungle boasts creamy dairy notes that pair well with just about any fruit and dessert recipes.
