Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Decadent Vapours Toffy, 5% and 10%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 52 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  A hard toffee *flavor* with some softer texture and richness.\n\nLeads with a pretty heavy caramelized sugar.  Seems to stop a bit short of being truly burnt or scorched though, at least at these percentages.  More of a caramelized top note, on top of a softer butterscotch candy type of base. Some buttery richness here, which takes the harder edge off the caramelized sugar notes.  Definitely has a bit of the butterscotch vibe that DV calls out in the description.  Feels a bit richer to me than FA Butterscotch, with a smoother creamy component.  I’m also picking up a light vanilla, but it doesn’t really seem out of place.\n\nSo theoretically toffee is a harder crack dessert, but texturally this actually seems a bit richer and almost chewy.  While those caramelized notes sort of tend towards a harder toffee, the texture manages to be a lot softer than that. Comparing this to a harder caramel flavor like FA Caramel, this has a lot more texture without picking up too many of those weird cardboard notes that softer flavors like CAP Caramel can pick up.  Seems to strike a pretty good balance between chewy and crisp.\n\nSweeter vape overall, but not too cloying or sucralose heavy.  Not a complete coil disaster, at least after 15ml.\n\nI haven’t tried a ton of toffee flavors, but this does seem considerably softer and richer than at least FLV Toffee, VT Hard Crack Toffee, and VT Honeycomb. It’s a lot less toasty than VT Hard Crack, but probably a bit darker than FLV Toffee and considerably darker than the honeycomb.\n\n**Off-Flavors:**  Softer, chewier texture than a hard toffee… but I’m not really complaining.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light.  Gets just a bit harsh on the throat despite the smoother texture.  I think it’s the caramelized sugar notes.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 5%, this is relatively blonde.  I’m still getting those caramelized sugar notes, but that softer, chewier base is coming through pretty well.  Sweet but not obnoxious, with a a good deal of richness carrying all that sugar.\n\nAt 10%,  feels a bit darker.  Seems to be drying out a bit and getting a little bitter.  Soft base is still there, but those caramelized sugar notes aren’t quite sinking into that richer base and feeling really cohesive. \n\nJust as a quick S&V at DV’s 20% this tastes a bit too burnt for me.  Just based on these tests, I’d probably be using this mostly as an accent around 3-4%.  If you wanted to solo this, I’d shoot for closer to 8%. \n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This feels a bit soft for a hard toffee component in a mix for me.  Doesn’t seem like it really hold it’s texture like toffee chunks in a mix.  \n\nI’d use it more like a fancy caramel sauce.  I’d pair it up against ice creams or custards, and in deserts with a caramel component like a caramel apple pie.  Something about the richness here also reminds me of a tres leches cake too, so that could be fun.\n\nAnd hey, you could make a pretty tasty spin on a RY4 with this.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  [All youtube reviews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcieAbdsikE)[ all the time.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_t-T9ewo0tw)\n\n[Here is the product page from DV.
