    "result": {"data":{"reviewsJson":{"markdown":"**Setup:** 5%: Druid with the short barrel, dual coil 9 wrap 24g kanthal, .37 ohms, 70 watts, cotton wicks\n\n10%: Conqueror Mini, dual coil 9 wrap 26g kanthal, .55 ohms, 45-50 watts\n\n**Testing:** HS Magic Mix @ 5% and 10%, 80/20 VG/PG, 3 mg nic, aged 2 weeks\n\n**Flavor description:** Kind of dry tobacco leaves, ashy, sweet smoked plum or prune in the background. Not really fruity or too sweet. Flavor profile is the same at both strengths. \n\n**Off-flavors:** None\n\n**Throat hit:** Medium. The dryness of the Tobacco note kind of hits the back of the throat more. The plum/prune flavor hits more on the back of the tongue. 10% mix is obviously a little stronger here. \n\n**Uses:** I think my preferred single flavor mix would be closer to the 10% range. If used as a base for a tobacco mix, I'd keep the percentage kind of high- probably in the 6-8% range. If you want to add a bit of flavorful ashiness to a mix, maybe in the 3-5% range. It could maybe be used like Dirty Neutral Base, but with much higher percentages. I haven't tried this yet, but if I were to try to mimic this flavor, I'd probably try something like .5% or .75% DNB and maybe .5% INW Smoked Plum, and 2%-3% INW Garuda. I might give this a shot and edit this with results. But that should give you an idea of what the flavor profile is like. \n\n**Pairings:** Pipe/cigar tobaccos, fruits for a fruity tobacco, could try some nuts and caramel and vanilla. \n\n**Notes:** I believe the INW Fortuna Strike is a clone of this flavor. They are certainly similar, but not really exact. Fortuna is almost a prune syrup kind of flavor with subtle tobacco notes hidden in the back. Magic Mix is more up front with the Tobacco and ash, with subtle plum notes. I probably wouldn't sub one for the other, but you might be able to get away with it. I'll personally probably stick with the INW because it's a little stronger and cheaper. I've always been hesitant with HS because it's more expensive and seems to need a bit more to really pop. Nonetheless, Magic Mix is a pretty solid flavor. I'll probably just rock it single at 10%. \n\n\n\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ChemicalBurnVictim","title":"Magic Mix","url":"https://redd.it/5qgyqa","vendor":{"name":"Hangsen","code":"HS"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"HS","title":"Magic Mix"}},
