Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Tropical Punch @ 1% and 1 drop per 10ml, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 6 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Worth noting right off the bat that I'm getting something that seems a bit different than what others are getting, so check the second opinions here.\n\nFor me at least, this tastes like Watermelon bubblicious gum down to weirder green rind note, with some added slightly warm red Hawaiian punch in the top notes. Seems like a pretty clear candyish profile, but overall is lacking a bit of deep sweetness and mouthfeel to really pull it off. Seems most useful between 1 and 3%.\n\nInhale is sweet and a bit dry. I'm getting some watermelon base flavor and some stickier, high punch type notes.  Moderately dense, but fairly top heavy. Exhale has candy watermelon up front, with some fragrant tropical top notes. It's hard picking anything out in particular, but I'm getting mostly guava with some pineapple as the exhales goes on. It's a \"warm\" vape, has that thing that woodier red berries have without a lot of the corresponding taste.  Maybe a bit of papaya earthiness in there too. Overall vape is sweet, but kind of a dryer, harsh sweetness.  Missing a lot of juicy or syrupy sweetness.  Seems a lot heavier on that candy watermelon base then on the tropical top notes.\n \n**Off-flavors:**  It's not objectionable, but this is more bubblicious watermelon gum for me at 1% and above.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Harsh under 1%, Actually a bit smoother between 1 and 3%, although it's still on the dry side.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  With some sweetener, and maybe a bit of added juiciness, it would make a pretty decent take on Hawaiian punch.  I think the relative dryness is kind of pushing that melon to the front, and with a bit of a moister, sweeter mouthfeel that tropical top end should pick up a bit.\n\nMelon and red berries should complement this pretty well, reinforcing some of the flavor already there.\n\nIf you cranked the sweetness up and added some candy texturizers, this would be a good base for some of the more tropical starburst or maybe skittles kind of candy flavors.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, .25% is light, floral, and harsh.  .5% is a bit better, but still on the lighter side of flavor.  Just the slightly dry, \"red\" part of this without a deeper base.  1% is a bit fuller, the red is a little less prominent, but I'm getting something that tastes a whole lot like warm watermelon bubblegum. Interesting, but a little weird.  1.5% is a little more mellow. That harsher \"red\" note seems to be sitting pretty well in the background while the candy watermelon pushes forward.  Fairly full flavor, but it feels like it's missing some depth and juiciness.  2% is closer to a slightly flat, undersweet watermelon bubble gum. The hawaiian punch part of this is pretty far in the background. Flavor seems pretty well saturated to me by 3%, with some of that weirder greener fake rind starting to come out of the concentrate. Still a bit undersweet, but moving up to 4 and 5% didn't seem to fix that while muddying and up the flavor substantially and adding quite a bit of dryness.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[All I do is follow the trail of someone who has stopped existing, the deleted user.. yet again:](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/32whni/my_flv_tasting_notes_tropical_punch/)\n\n\"Pleasant if somewhat generic tropical punch flavors with no one flavor dominant. Very “Red Hawaiian Punch”. Mild flavor. No off notes present. Try with rum, tropical/citrus fruits, rose and almond in a Mai-Tai mix.\"\n\n[Here's the ELR Page, consensus seems to be that it's fairly accurate to hawaiian punch, doesn't have any weird off flavors, and suggested between 3.5% and 5.0% for a single flavor.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/3302)\n\n\n[Heres the Flavorah product page.  Their description: \"Like tropical fruit dropping from the trees, this bold and balanced flavor is ripe for picking. Stand alone, it is a fantastic tropical anchor for your daily vape.\"](http://store.flavorah.com/concentrated-tropical-punch-flavor)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Tropical Punch","url":"https://redd.it/67djfc","vendor":{"name":"Flavorah","code":"FLV"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FLV","title":"Tropical Punch"}},
