Very realistic meaty coconut, creamy milk, and moderately sweet. Not as sweet as sweetened coconut but a little bit sweeter than natural. I'm thinking the natural sweetness of the VG might be adding a little to it, very very good!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:** Slight plastic the first 2 days, then disappeared.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit:** 1/10\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Pairings:** Most any fruit, especially pineapple, peaches, melons. Cookies, cakes, cereal, creams, custards, nuts, tobaccos.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Notes:** 7% is a really good strength for a SF. I am going to try 1.5-4% in blends. I do love FA coconut, but this one is edging it out I think.\n","author":"mysticrosell","title":"Fresh Coconut","url":"https://redd.it/5mwv1d","vendor":{"name":"Purilum","code":"PUR"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"PUR","title":"Fresh Coconut"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
