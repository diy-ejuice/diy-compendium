This is a pretty accurate flavor and a good way to sweeten and lighten some recipes.\n\nAt 5% it stays pretty much the same. \n\nSame goes for 10%, except the vanilla shines through more and mutes other flavors.\n\n##**Recommended Percentage and Steep:**##\n\nI would recommend =<2% for standalone flavor and a short steep (overnight to 3 days).\n\n\n\n##**Toxicity**##\nVolatile | contains\n---|---\nAcetoin | x\nDiacetyl |  \nAcetyl Propionyl|  x\n\n***\n\nMy testing setup:\nGriffin RTA, Dual Kanthal Coils reading at 0.5, 30 Watts.\n\nI make 3 10ml bottles (3mg nicotine, 50/50 PG VG) and steep them for 4 weeks. I test them after 1, 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days.","author":"SONDERvape","title":"Marshmallow","url":"https://redd.it/4nljeb","vendor":{"name":"The Flavor Apprentice","code":"TFA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"TFA","title":"Marshmallow"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
