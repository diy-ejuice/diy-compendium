    "result": {"data":{"reviewsJson":{"markdown":"**Setup:** Recoil w/ flavor barrel, Dual fused claptons @ .26 ohms. 60 watt\n\n**Testing:** Wonder Flavours: Caramel Butter @ 5%. 1 day steep\n\n**Flavor Description:**\nMildly sweet softcrack caramel that is not very dark. It is a  very creamy caramel with a medium to thick mouthfeel with a smooth buttery finish. It is almost as if the caramel wasn't quite cooked long enough, like those soft homemade caramels that was taken off the stove just a little too soon. \n\n**Off-flavors:** Nothing out of the ordinary here, taste like a mellow creamy caramel\n\n**Throat Hit:** Very easy on the throat, smooth exhale\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I could see this being used really effectively in custards and creams to sweeten them up a bit. It is very light and not too sweet that it would take away from the other flavors.\nI can also see this being used to add a touch of caramel to bakeries or maybe even coffee mixes.\n\n**Notes:**\nI am really hoping that with a steep, this flavor comes out a little more or perhaps it needs more flavoring. It is a nice soft chewy caramel that is just a little too light for my liking. As a single flavor it falls a little flat for my tastes as well, I can see it being really good with maybe a touch of butterscotch to bump up the richness\n\n**Second Opinions:**\nBeing as this is a fairly new company there isn't any other notes or reviews to help me out. Please if you have differing opinions leave a comment as I would love to get some other people's take on this flavor. More WF flavor reviews to come.\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"mlNikon","title":"Caramel Butter","url":"https://redd.it/5mb74f","vendor":{"name":"Wonder Flavors","code":"WF"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"WF","title":"Caramel Butter"}},
