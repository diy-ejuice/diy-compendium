Not particularly an authentic & juicy raspberry, but an enjoyable raspberry flavor nonetheless.  Almost has a \"Gusher's\" juicy filling nuance to it, but with a darker more raspberry taste.  Definitely has some texture to it as a standalone. \n \n**Off-flavors:**  Sometimes it seems slightly chalky or powdery @ 2%, but not necessarily in a bad way.\n\n**Throat hit:** Very smooth on the throat. 2/10. \n\n**Uses:**  The ever popular [Rhodonite](http://diyordievaping.com/2015/08/17/rhodonite/) recipe by /u/enyawreklaw uses this at 0.5%.  Also great in other dessert, yogurt, or fruity recipes.  \n\n**Pairings:** Light or dark fruits, creams, custards, nuts.  I can also imagine it working well with a tobacco pairing.  A juicier raspberry or other juicy fruit flavor to round it out or make it \"pop\" could be used too if you prefer.\n\n**Notes:**   Greatly benefits from the addition of other fruits, but also holds it's own as a single fruit flavor in a mix due to it's high potency and unique texture.  I can definitely smell it when someone is vaping it.  This flavor seems like it would be pretty versatile in nearly any recipe.  If you're bored of what you've been vaping, sub a fruit or just add 0.5-1% of this and it will likely bring your recipe to a new level.\n\nEDIT: [Link to all of our flavor reviews in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)","author":"wh1skeyk1ng","title":"Raspberry (Koncentrat)","url":"https://redd.it/4q0hvk","vendor":{"name":"Inawera","code":"INW"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"INW","title":"Raspberry (Koncentrat)"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
