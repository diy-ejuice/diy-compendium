Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** TPA Pineapple (Juicy), 3% and 6%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 8 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  A juicy pineapple marshmallow?\n\nTart, but still candied, pineapple flavor.  Tarter top notes have some acidity and freshness and skew closer to realistic.  The body of the flavor leans a bit more towards candied, with a white gummy bear type sweetness and saturation.  Very light savory, almost sulfur note to the pineapple but it's subtle and no worse than INW Pineapple which doesn't really show up in mixes.\n\nThis is somehow both dry and juicy at the same time, especially at higher percentages.  Inhale actually has some juicy pineapple up top, but there's a slightly dry, almost fluffy volume to the mouthfeel.  Juiciness sticks around for the beginning of the exhale but that fluffiness takes over on the back end.  I also pick up some vanilla here, especially after that juicier pineapple fades out.   Comes across a bit like a marshmallow, or like it's premixed with TPA Vanilla Swirl. Overall effect is an odd juxtaposition of texture.\n\nComparing this to some of the other widely used pineapple flavors, this isn't as juicy as CAP golden pineapple for me, but it does fresher even with those candied notes.  Less realistic than INW pineapple but more saturated and full.  Comparing it to the standard TPA Pineapple, it's more candied and sweeter and while this has some tartness to it, it doesn't have the tropical battery acid thing going on that the standard one does.  Does seem noticeably less harsh, but that vanilla and fluffiness is different.  Solo TPA pineapple has a bit of butryic note (that usually doesn't show up steeped) that I'm not getting off the juicy pineapple.  Sulfury pineapple note is basically neglible in all of this these.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Almost marshmallow like fluffy texture.  Decent amount of vanilla in here as well.  Very light sulfur note.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light to moderate.  Still a bit of bite but nothing as aggressive as TPA Pineapple.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 3% this has a softer pineapple flavor. Not really saturated, with a light tartness, and a decent juiciness. Some of that fluffy texture with a lighter vanilla accent.  Fairly smooth overall, without much harshness.\n\nAt 6% I'm getting a more prominent vanilla and a noticeably fluffier texture.  Actual pineapple is a bit brighter and more candied. Feels juicier at the beginning but drier at the end. Pineapple hits quite a bit harder here but I wouldn't call it harsh.\n\nJust based on these tests, I'd keep this low as an accent for some tart, non-descript juiciness at around 2%.  You aren't going to get a clear pineapple, but you also won't run into that fluffy body nearly as hard.  As a primary flavor, and in an application where you don't mind the body, I'd go higher around 5-7%.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  The preferred application for this is something that works with both the pineapple, and that marshmallow-ish body.  Good fit pineapple candies that need some texture.\n\nOutside of a pineapple forward-candy, use an accent behind other fruits to juice up and slightly texturize mixes.\n\nSeems a bit too candied and artificial for something like a pineapple bakery.  I think it'd mix well with creams, but isn't going to taste like an actual pineapple is in there.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  [The ELR page here is less than helpful.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/78592)  Whole bunch of pairing lists and \"Odins Wrath\" declares it \"Not Bad.\"\n\n[Some product reviews up on DIY Ejuice.  User \"Ryan Disano\" writes: \"Too me, seems like a watered down original tpa pineapple. Great for recipes where you dont want the pineapple to totally take over, as the original tends to do.\"  And \"Jeff\" from Calgary calls it \"the best pineapple flavor.\"](https://www.diy-ejuice.com/Juicy-Pineapple-by-TFA-TPA-p/tpa-juicypineapple.htm)\n\n[No actual info on Pineapple (Juicy) in this post, I just thought it was funny.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/4izigv/lets_talk_about_tpa_pineapple_and_harshness/)  OP complains about TPA pineapple being harsh, says they have juicy pineapple coming in, altneurose gets all science-y with the component list, OP promises to report back, and OP does not.  Also, ID10-T's best description with FA Pineapple (and there is a lot to choose from there.)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Pineapple (Juicy)","url":"https://redd.it/7rlr17","vendor":{"name":"The Flavor Apprentice","code":"TFA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"TFA","title":"Pineapple (Juicy)"}},
