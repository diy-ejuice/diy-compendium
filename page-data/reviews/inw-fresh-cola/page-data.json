It smells kinda like pepsi twist with no CO2 in it at all. Like you would open a can of pepsi and left it for half a day. There are hints of citrus fruits and some kind of sweetener I think, cause it's not that sour. It has some minty off-notes, too.\n\n**The inhale.**\n\nThe throat hit is mild progressing to a heavier hit, and the taste when inhaling reminds me of the taste of cola when taking a first sip, you know what I mean? Not fully cola-like, but you can't miss what you're drinking.\n\n\n\n**The exhale.**\n\nThroat hit at the exhale is for me not too heavy, but I definetly wouldn't call it light. It's on the heavier side and I like it, like I mentioned in, I think, pretty much all of my reviews :) \n\nAs for the taste, you know that pleasant taste when drinking cola out of the can? I can't really describe it that well, I think it has to do something with the can itself... but for me it's like that. I can tell that it's cola, but the taste reminds me more of a cheaper kinds of coke than i.e pepsi or coca-cola. \nThere are also citrus notes, some lemon in there, more like lime actually, mixed with more delicate orange off notes. I can't taste any mint in there though, as shown on the packaging.\nIt leaves a slightly sweet taste on my tounge, something like condensated cola.\n\n**Uses and pairings**: I would pair it with some lemon aromas just to see if more citrus notes can make it a bit fresher. Other than that, I would go solo with this concentrate.\n\n**Personal testing notes**: 5% and below is fine, no need to go higher. It's so much better than Capella's cherry cola, which for me tastes like antibiotics.\n\n\n**Summary:** Quite good cola flavour, but I don't think it's \"the one\" yet. For me it's worth the money and won't leave you with an unpleasant experience. Try it if you like mixing cola with lemons or citrus fruits in general.\n Any recommendations for cola-like juices? :)\n\nquestions/co-op/review propositions: mrgvape@gmail.com","author":"mrgruszka","title":"Fresh Cola","url":"https://redd.it/7rpkmh","vendor":{"name":"Inawera","code":"INW"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"INW","title":"Fresh Cola"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
