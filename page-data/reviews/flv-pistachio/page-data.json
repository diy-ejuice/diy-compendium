Will be trying to hit some less reviewed flavors. Love Y'all.\n\n**Setup**\nRDA/Goon Coil/7wrap Single Parallel SS316L Watts/48 Wicking/Full/Muji Cotton\n\n**Testing**\nSteep Time/2 weeks % Used/ 1.25 and 3% PG/VG 30/70 Nic/ 2mg/ML\n\n**Mouthfeel**\nDense and creamy. At higher percentage 3% and above it remains creamy but can feel dry/harsh especially the first day or two.\n\n**Throat Hit**\n6/10 with steep throat hit is substantially less noticeable, especially at lower %.\n\n**Flavor Properties**\nJust a touch dry but creamy at 1.25%. I am getting a light and sweet pistachio note. This flavor steeps very nicely and reminds me of FW Hazelnut when used at a low % except with pistachio notes.\nAt 3% this flavor stands out as a spot on pistachio. Its lightly sweet and I can almost notice the taste of a real pistachio skin and the whole ‘nut’ itself. \nFun fact pistachios are part of the cashew family and are technically stone fruits. \n\n**Relatable Flavors**\nReminds me of the after taste of eating a pistachio, the fruit itself becomes creamy while you eat it and its creamy here while you vape it. TPA Pistachio is much more candy like but great in its own ways. \nI’ve used them together and the results have been pretty good but I need to mess around some more. \nHaven’t tried any other pistachio flavors aside from TPA.\n\n**Position In The Recipe**\nAt 3% I can see this being the main note of your pistachio (insert cream or dessert here) vape. If you want a sweeter pistachio I’d start with 2% FLV and 3.5% TPA pistachio then add your creams or cakes to tone that nut down a bit. I love this as an accent to creams and even bakery stuff at 1%, it adds a nice mouthfeel and the pistachio will not be noticeable in most mixes. This flavor needs a couple days to steep and at 3% it definitely benefits from a week or more of sitting. \n\n**Off Flavors**\nAt the higher % I could notice an almost butyric acid like note when shaked and vaped but it becomes feint after steeping.\n\n**Pairings**\nOther nuts, creams, ice cream, milks, pies, cakes, many desserts. I could see this working with tobacco, yogurts, some citrus fruits, strawberry, chocolate, coffee, pomegranate, apples, maybe even watermelon or apricot.\n\n**Notes**\nI really enjoy this flavor, I love pistachio things. FLV did an awesome job here, aside from Rich Cinnamon this is the only FLV concentrate I have so far and I look forward to trying some of their other stuff. I recommend this to anyone looking for pistachio. \n\n**Rating 90/100**\n\n**Peace, Love, and If You Disagree Then Lets Hear It:**\n\n**Also Here’s One of My Recipes, Using This Flavor:**\n\n*Nuts & Cream v4*\n%\tVendor\tFlavor\n\n1.65\t(FA)\nAlmond\n\n2\t(TPA)\nBavarian Cream\n\n0.7\t(FA)\nHazel Grove (hazelnut)\n\n1\t(FW)\nHazelnut\n\n2\t(FLV)\nPistachio\n\n1\t(INW)\nShisha Vanilla\n\n0.75\t(TPA)\nToasted Marshmallow\n\n2.75\t(CAP)\nVanilla Custard\n\nNotes in the Nov Recipe Thread and on ATF: \n\nhttps://alltheflavors.com/recipes/18702#n_c_v4_by_vdevil\n\n\nEdit: formatting for mobile\nAlso edit fucked up the **** somewhere\n","author":"HashSlingingSlashur","title":"Pistachio","url":"https://redd.it/5auunc","vendor":{"name":"Flavorah","code":"FLV"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FLV","title":"Pistachio"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
