Smells like concentrated limes with a strong, like really strong graham tone. Like you'd have a really dark, almost burnt graham cookie and covered it with lime juice. There is also a slight custard aftertone. It's pleasant.\n\n\nThe throat hit is quite on the heavier side on the inhale (and on the exhale), but I like it.\n\nAs for the taste, it's something different from what I've been trying to this point. I wouldn't think that a combination of dark, heavy cookies and limes would be good for me, but as it turns out, it's quite alright! There main flavor is of course the lime, but it's not overwhelming. Then the cookies hit you, but do not think that you will instantly recognize them here. They mix with limes well in this -  I don't know how to put it right - the taste of cookies is wrapped around the lime taste. I would say that it has become my daily vape also.\n\n**Uses and pairings:** I wouldn't pair it with anything. Maybe I'd try to mix it with some custardy-creamy concentrates, but haven't tried yet.\n\n**Personal testing notes**: 5% and below is fine, no need to go higher. Steeping decreases the throat hit a lot.\n\n**Summary:** Pretty good concentrate, but I don't think it's for everyone. Some of you will say it's shit, some that it's great. It's quite unusual I would say, but if you like the tastes that I described, you can try it.\n\n**Questions**: DM @unodosvape on instagram or mrgvape@gmail.com","author":"mrgruszka","title":"Lime Monster","url":"https://redd.it/9xdu5z","vendor":{"name":"Inawera","code":"INW"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"INW","title":"Lime Monster"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
