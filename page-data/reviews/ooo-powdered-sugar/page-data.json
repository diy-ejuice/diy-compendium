This is a lot like meringue without the eggy and cream notes, exactly what I was expecting from this flavor. The sweetness really lingers and stays with you in the back of your throat.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Perhaps I used this too high but the sweetness is slightly chemical tasting, nothing too off putting though and I have a feeling it will be covered up fairly easily.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  This is very smooth albeit a little dry but no stingy sensation or tightness.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This is going to be a very versatile part of my collection. I can see using this anywhere I want to sweeten up a mix that isn't very creamy without adding any off flavors. Will be great in bakeries and even as a light dusting of sugar in fruit mixes. \n\n\n**Notes:**\nI really like this flavor it is very sweet but doesn't seem to gunk up my coils too bad. I think I need to play with this in mixes and using it way lower than I did. But even testing it so high I didn't get too bad of off flavors with it. \n\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**\n\nIf you have different opinions on the flavor or any ideas on how to use it please post them in the comments.
