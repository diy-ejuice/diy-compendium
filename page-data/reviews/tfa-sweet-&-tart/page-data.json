You should know that it's not you, it's your flavors. It happens to all mixers at some point. It's not a big deal. It's cool, really. We can just cuddle (and talk dirty, I hope).\n\nAnyway, I'm rocking 8 wraps, kanthal, on a 2.0mm single, spaced coil, at around 20 watts on an RTA. I explored it up to 30 for this review, but I'm always around 18-23 watts tops. I feel weird even disclosing that, because it feels like a dirty secret, but I realize it's important for flavor reviews, so, here I am. This is me. I like high builds and I cannot lie, and battery life can't be denied.\n\n3% after a 3-day steep - Dear jesus, this is awful. I might actually go to my next High School reunion and waste some of this this on some bottom-shelf plastic-jug vodka with TFA Grape Juice or FW Grapeberry Ice and tell 'em it's [Everclear Purple Passion!](http://drinkpurplepassion.com/) **LOL!**\n\nBut seriously, Everything said about this flavor is 100% true, BUT... it's worth noting that if you already have this flavor, you kind of can work with it, and make something sorta' vapeable. The secret? A 10-day steep. \n\nIs it still chalky/powdery? Yes, but in exactly the way that Razzles, SweetTarts, PixyStix and all that other bullshit candy is. Before that, it's hellacious. Bitter, harsh and noxious. After that? No moreso than the junk candies it's trying to emulate already are.\n\nTo see what I mean, try this:  \n**5% FA Forest Fruit  \n2% FW Sour  \n3% TPA SweetTANGY**\n\nMix it at 70/30 VG/PG, shake the hell out of it, DO NOT heat/breathe-steep it, just close it up tight, hide it somewhere temperate and dark, and come back to it in 10 days or so after another good shake. It's a dead-nuts-on Sour Berry SweetTart. \n\nIs it great? Nope. Is it good? Yeah, actually. Better than any premium SweetTart-type juice I've bought. \n\nThere are a million tastier things you can mix up out there, but as far as that powdery junk candy? You can't do better than TFA SweetTANGY.  \n\nSour just doesn't translate into ejuice yet. As /u/enyawreklaw  has already [explained](http://diyordievaping.com/2016/09/07/flavor-talk-sour-vapes-diy-ejuice-mixing-tips/). For now, this'll do. 4-stars from me, with all aforementioned reservations.\n\nIf you don't already have this flavor, seriously, don't buy it for this. It's gah-bige, as [my people](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dorchester/) would say. Take that FA Forest Fruit and use it it any one of a bah-zillion better recipes.\n\nI hope this review is helpful to all the poor suckers, like me, who bought this, hoping for a sour junk-candy vape.","author":"RuntDastardly","title":"Sweet & Tart","url":"https://redd.it/541vzc","vendor":{"name":"The Flavor Apprentice","code":"TFA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"TFA","title":"Sweet & Tart"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
