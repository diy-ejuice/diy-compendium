Nice and dense I would give it a 8 out of 10. No throat hit.\n\n**Flavor Properties**- A nice smooth cream, very Dairy tasting with no egg flavor. Moderately buttery with no vanilla and just a hint of sweetness.\n\n**Relatable Flavors** - like drinking a glass of half and half lightly sweetened.\n\n**Off Flavors** - I have nothing to say here, I think flavor art did a perfect job but let me know if you taste anything off.         \n\n**Position in the recipe** - Very rich and heavy so my opinion is that belongs in the base, can also be used to Accent other creams.\n\n**Pairings** - Can I just say everything and be done? (No.... shit.... fine)\n\nOther creams, chocolates, bakeries, vanilla's, fruits, mint, spice flavorings, tobacco's, cereals such as fruit circles and Floral flavorings.I've even tried it with Cola and like the results.","author":"Chrisdvr1","title":"Fresh Cream","url":"https://redd.it/4mer26","vendor":{"name":"Flavour Art","code":"FA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FA","title":"Fresh Cream"}},
