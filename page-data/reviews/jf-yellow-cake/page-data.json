No overly baked notes. It does have a very \"Yellow\" flavor to it at 5%. The thickness you would expect from a cake is here. It is not lacking on any moistness either. It has the moisture, baked cake flavor and the iconic yellow flavor right up front. For a single flavor mix it is pretty strong and very close to an authentic yellow cake flavor.\n\n**Off-flavors**: I can taste no off flavors are aren't common with a yellow cake when used at 5%\n\n**Throat hit**: Nothing of note/ incredibly smooth\n\n**Uses**: As one of the few people that hates FW Yellow Cake I've been looking for a suitable sub for it for a while. I think this is it. This would go great with anything that needs a plain cake flavor note. Try subbing this flavor in for FW YC and see how it works. I don't think you'll be disappointed. I'm impressed with this flavor; it's better than I expected. \n\n**Note**: I will update this review if I find this flavor changes at all with a steep. Shaked and vaped it is incredibly good and not lacking at all.\n\n**Recipe**: **Mediocre FuckNut** - A Jelly Filled Donut\n\n**FA WOW** - 3%\n\n**JF Sweet Strawberry** - 1%\n\n**FA Joy** - .5%\n\n**TFA Cheesecake GC** - 1%\n\n**JF Yellow Cake** - 1%\n\nPretty good shake and vape but needs a couple days for the FA Wow to, well, wow you.","author":"chewymidget","title":"Yellow Cake","url":"https://redd.it/57ncf9","vendor":{"name":"Jungle Flavors","code":"JF"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"JF","title":"Yellow Cake"}},
