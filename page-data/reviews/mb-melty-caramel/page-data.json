Steeped for a total of 3 weeks and tested once a week.  Flavor was purchased from DIYVAPORSUPPLY\n\n\nMolinberrys description:\nWarm, melty caramel - sweet, delicate and full of flavor. Perfect for dessert mixes. Proposed dose 7-8%\n\n\nOff the shake:\nOn the back the hand it taste like a very sweet creamy caramel, but when vaped it has the sweet caramel taste with a musky note on the tail end. \n\n\nAfter one week steep:\nThe cream/syrupiness is coming through. Sweet caramel is still there but unfortunately that musky/butyric acid like note was also still there. \n\n\nWeek 2-3\nThere was no change in flavor from week one testing. The muskiness did seem to be dialed back alittle or maybe i was just getting accustomed to it. \n\n\nMy thoughts: \nI can not see mixing this solo any higher then 4% the musky butyric acid note would take over the flavor. The caramel note in it is great. Sweetness & creaminess level are both good. Just have that strange musky off note to contend with. Although it seems to be easily covered up when mixed with other flavors. \n\n\nSuggested mixing %:\n.5-2% if pushed any higher the muskiness will be harder to cover up in the mix. \n\n\nSuggested pairings:\nCreams,tobaccos,apples,bananas,bakeries,candies, or with another caramel. \n\n\nI would rate this 3.5/5 \n\n\nRecipe is used this in used it at 1.5% and it worked very well in there. \n\nhttps://alltheflavors.com/recipes/73521#cinnamon_banana_nut_ry4_by_enyawreklaw","author":"ebc88","title":"Melty Caramel","url":"https://redd.it/84rwli","vendor":{"name":"MolinBerry","code":"MB"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"MB","title":"Melty Caramel"}},
