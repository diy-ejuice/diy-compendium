This tastes like a pretty standard root beer with Dad's or Barq's coming to mind first. the most impressive quality of this flavor is the foamy mouthfeel I'm getting. it isn't quite effervescent, but that thick foamy head is very much present. I get some vanilla, wintergreen, subtle anise/licorice, and maybe a little honey or molasses. overall sweetness is at the perfect level for my tastes.\n\n**Off-flavors:** nothing, except that I occasionally pick up a mild candy dryness which may go away with steeping, or could be in my head. thought I would mention it anyway to see if anyone else picks it up.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:** I would use this at 1-2% depending on personal preference. I find that for me, almost every FLV flavor falls into this usage range. the obvious pairing would be with ice cream for a delicious root beer float and I think this is a perfect choice for that profile. it's pretty damn great solo too!\n\n**Notes & Second Opinions:** I know that a few other members of this sub have been given access to the pre-release flavors, so if you want to add anything in the comments I would appreciate it greatly!","author":"PerennialPhilosopher","title":"Root Beer","url":"https://redd.it/6wnzh3","vendor":{"name":"Flavorah","code":"FLV"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FLV","title":"Root Beer"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
