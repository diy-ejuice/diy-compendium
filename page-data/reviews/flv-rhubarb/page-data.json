Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Rhubarb@ .1% or 1% of a 1:10 dilution, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 7 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Crazy strong raw, fresh rhubarb.  This is definitely a 1 drop per 30ml kind of flavor.  Tart, dry, and earthy all at the same time.\n\nInhale is dry and tannic. Really authentic rhubarb tartness with some sour notes.  No real sweetness here.  Exhale is really earthy rhubarb.  Strong grassy top notes.  Very vegetal and earthy overall. There is still some tartness in the exhale, but it's less pronounced on the exhale than on the inhale.  Same kind of dry tannic mouthfeel.  Again, not a hint of sweetness.\n\n**Off Flavors:**  Spooky realistic, so it may not be the sweeter rhubarb you're looking for. It's accurate to raw rhubarb.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light.  Not super noticeable down ultra-low where you'll be working.  The dryness here can get a get to be a bit much.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:** With fruit pairings, I'd suggest something sweet and jammy to fill out the earthier drier rhubarb.  Raspberry and rhubarb is great, also pairs really well with strawberry.\n\nA good base for a bakery rhubarb in something like a crumble or pie, but it will need quite a bit of fruit and sweetness to really make the rhubarb palatable.\n\nI like the idea of using this as a tobacco additive. It'll work quite a bit like FLV Lovage, although it'll bring in more green notes. Probably worth staying away from dryer, nuttier tobaccos and instead going for something more aromatic that can stand up to earthy, herbal flavors.  Should make everything feel drier and more tannic.\n\nSeems a bit too earthy to mix pleasantly with creams.\n\n**Notes:** Concentration testing, this one is easy. Start hella low. 1 drop per 30ml may be a bit too strong and you may need a dilution. The flavor here is super interesting but it's really intense.  By .5% it tastes a lot like dirty celery.  I think it's a useful concentrate, especially if you're looking for some authentic rhubarb complexity in a mix, but it's going to be really easy to go overboard with this.  15ml is a lifetime supply for you and four of your weird rhubarb loving friends.\n\nThe big comparison would INW Rhubarb. INW Rhubarb is great, but it tastes like a rhubarb simple syrup. It's sweet and tart, whereas this is tart, dry, and earthy.  I'd say INW Rhubarb is a candy rhubarb, and this is like cutting your rhubarb straight off the plant, shaving it thin, and popping it straight in your mouth.  I'd avoid it as a single flavor, but it's really interesting and done really well if you're into the profile.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nNot a lot.\n\n[Flavorah's description is: \"Vegetal, unsweetened rhubarb flavor. If you are looking for your mom's rhubarb crisp with 12 gallons of sugar, then you will need to mix this flavor with some other fruits and sweets, but standalone you will get a clear rhubarb with earthy and fibrous flavor notes.\" I think they nailed the description.](http://store.flavorah.com/concentrated-rhubarb-flavor)\n\n[ELR page has one note. User \"OldFashioned\" suggests 3.0% as a single flavor.  User \"OldFashioned\" is wrong.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/151702)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Rhubarb","url":"https://redd.it/62juyi","vendor":{"name":"Flavorah","code":"FLV"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FLV","title":"Rhubarb"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
