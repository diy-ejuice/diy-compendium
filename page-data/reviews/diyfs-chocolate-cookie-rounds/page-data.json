Reminds me of the same cocoa taste that is in their nutella flavor. It’s a decent chocolate taste, not really like an oreo reminds me more of a chips ahoy chocolate chip. Its slightly more creamy than cookie and at higher wattage is gross, like a super burnt cookie crust. \n\n*Muted chocolate butter flavor.*\n\n**Off-flavors**:  Not really an oreo cookie flavor, a bit more buttery than expected. \n\n**Throat Hit**:  something but not much (3/10)\n\n**Uses**:  Not really sure. I think this could somehow work for a chocolate chip cookie recipe. Its just a weak flavoring and its quite dark so anything over 5% will result in a considerably brown final product. I think paired with some other stronger chocolate (HS Australian chocolate) and maybe more cookie flavor, this could make a nice crumble for ice cream cake ( which Is what I first thought of when I saw this flavor). Not sure I will use this flavor in the future but it is ok at best.\n\n**Pairings**:  Creams, custards, other chocolates, butter, cakes, cookies, ice cream. \n\n**Notes** I’d say skip this one, chocolate gunks your coils anyway.\n\n**Second Opinions**\n\nNothing out there, probably for good reason.\n","author":"HashSlingingSlashur","title":"Chocolate Cookie Rounds","url":"https://redd.it/5pz07l","vendor":{"name":"DIY Flavor Shack","code":"DIYFS"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"DIYFS","title":"Chocolate Cookie Rounds"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
