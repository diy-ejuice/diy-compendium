No throat hit.        \n\n**Flavor Properties**- Creamy and rich  super smooth icecream with the  the perfect vanilla. Not artificial Not spicy moderately eggy, heavy on the dairy, fairly sweet, and that super rich butter & cream you expect in an ice cream or custard.\n\n**Relatable Flavors** - To me this is I like eating a spoon full of blue bunny vanilla ice cream, or a vanilla buttercream.\n\n**Off Flavors** -  I'm not finding any faults here I have heard people say that VBIC can be peppery. I have had what I would describe as spicy vanilla before  but I'm not getting that here. (I'm assuming it's the TFA)\n\n**Position in the recipe** - With its super-dense properties my opinion is this is best in a base, could also be used to Accent other creams.\n\n**Pairings** - Other creams, berries, fruits, tobacco's, bakeries, and beverages like Cola or root beer.","author":"Chrisdvr1","title":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream","url":"https://redd.it/4mqce2","vendor":{"name":"Flavor West","code":"FW"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FW","title":"Vanilla Bean Ice Cream"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
