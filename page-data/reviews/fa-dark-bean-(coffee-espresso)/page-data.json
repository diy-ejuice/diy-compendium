Single Coil SS 26g. .6Ω. 22-30 Watts. Cotton Wick       \n**% Used:** 2    \n**Steep Time:** 1 day - 2 weeks    \n**Flavor Description:** Coffee,Roasted,Nutty,Slight Cocoa,Earthy,Green    \n**Off-Flavors:**  Slightly bitter end note    \n**Pairings:**  Creams, Mints, Mocha, Desserts, Tobaccos    \n**Position In The Recipe:** Mostly upfront to middle. Not a strong inhale flavor and not much on the end.\n**Relatable Flavors:** Like eating a lightly roasted coffee bean after you've swallowed the bean itself, the taste it leaves on your palate. Sharp and bitter. Like a cup of espresso without any creams or sweeteners. Strong and slightly watery.    \n**Notes:** It's a black coffee. At .6Ω I had to drop it down to 22 W because I was getting a strong green note above that. Like a green coffee bean that slipped into the lot, not roasted. Earthy green. This flavor is usually mixed with a lot of other flavors piled onto it. Used as a coffee note and a very good one if not the best out there. Personally I can vape this alone @ 2% with 70 VG and the VG provides enough sweetness to make it a nice vape. If you like a Iced Skinny Cinnamon Dolce Latte, Milk Chocolate Melted Truffle Mocha, etc. This will provide all the coffee note your looking for. For sure.    \n**Rating:** 5/5 ","author":"TexasHex","title":"Dark Bean (Coffee Espresso)","url":"https://redd.it/4o5mlh","vendor":{"name":"Flavour Art","code":"FA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FA","title":"Dark Bean (Coffee Espresso)"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
