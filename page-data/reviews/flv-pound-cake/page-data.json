Somewhat thin mouthfeel.\n\n**Throat Hit** 1/10           \n\n**Flavor Properties**\n\nLight, fluffy cake. Slight hint of coconut(?) or maybe just the faintest hint of anise. Brings a sweetness to the flavor that is really unique, and not very pronounced at all.\n\n**Relatable Flavors** \n\nFLV Coconut due to the buttery coconut flesh flavor,                        \n                            \n**Off Flavors** \n\nThe coconut/anise note may be a bit much for people that are sensitive to anise. It's a very much baked coconut/anise, not like black licorice.\n\n**Position In The Recipe** \n\nBase. Meant to be built upon.\n\n**Pairings** \n\nI can imagine this going well with FA cookie, CAP sugar cookie, some butterscotch or caramel flavors.            \n\n**Notes**                \n\nPre-release sample  \n\n**Rating** B+, this flavor is a decent flavor, but it isn't the best in its class.\n\n*Please if your opinion differs, or you have another review for this post it in the comments.
