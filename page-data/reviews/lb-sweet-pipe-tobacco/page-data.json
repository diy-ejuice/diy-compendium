Shout out to Liquid Barn*\n\n**Setup:** Recoil w/ flavor barrel, Dual 15 wrap 26g 3mm Nifethal 70 coils @.14 ohms.  60w power, 450F temp limit. Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Liquid Barn Sweet Pipe Tobacco, 5 and 10%  @ 1g/ml, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 33 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Mostly just sweet, almost no tobacco.  Might have some use as a tobacco enhancer but it really doesn't come across a tobacco by itself.\n\nI'm getting very little tobacco out of this.  There's maybe a bit of that slightly dirty warm harshness you get from TPA RY4 Double, but it's pretty light overall.  If they didn't have it in the concentrate name this wouldn't ever really register as as any kind of tobacco.  Nothing leafy, smoky, ashy, nutty, or fruity in here.\n\nIt's definitely sweet though.  It has a really light kind of vanilla to it, somewhere between cream soda and a marshmallow, with some light fluffier mouthfeel.  This feels a whole lot like FA Oba Oba.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  An almost complete lack of the \"pipe tobacco\" part of \"sweet pipe tobacco.\"\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light.  Not much at all.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 5%, I'm not getting all that much out of this.  Light vanilla, light mouthfeel, maybe a tiny bit of that mystery tobacco-ish vibe.\n\nAt 10%, this is mostly just sweetness, light vanilla, and a bit more of that mouthfeel.  Any of that mystery tobacco that might be in there at 5% is covered up.\n\nLiquid Barn suggests 10% with this, and it's fine there in terms of a lack of off-notes, but there isn't any tobacco.  I think if you are going to be using this, you'd be best served by treating it like Oba Oba.  Somwhere around 4% should be vaguely equivalent to .5% Oba Oba.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  So this definitely isn't a solo flavor, or even a primary flavor in a mix.  It seems like it's mostly going to be useful as a sweet tobacco additive, sort of making another bolder tobacco flavor into a sweet pipe tobacco.\n\nTrying this at 7% with FLV Cavendish @ 3%, it definitely seems to knock some of the harsher edges off, sweeten the mix, and add some mouthfeel.  The vanilla in this doesn't really come through.  Largely the same results with 3% FLV Kentucky Blend, and 3% FLV Oriental Tobacco.\n\nIt's hard to recommend this over FA Oba Oba just because the pretty immense gulf in concentration, but if you already have it, it can be used in largely the same fashion.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Here's the ELR Page.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/67288)  User \"JoJo\" writes: \"6% (SnV - pretty light, sweet, generic. Not getting much tobacco. 1 week - same. Sweet, maybe a hint of a pipe flavor. 2 weeks - Pretty much the same. Kinda sweet and light, but not really getting any kind of pipe. 3 weeks - still pretty generic tasting. Guess it needs to be a higher %. 4 weeks - same.)\" User \"Jose\" writes: \"Not unpleasant but pretty light, even at 10% I don't get much pipe. Put the percentage up to 15%, same result, sweet, not unpleasant but pipe?\"  User \"Bikerdude\" writes: \"At 10% I get a weak tobacco, smooth with a hint of sweetness. No throat hit to speak of but a semi-thick mouthfeel. This flavor might be useful to knock the edge off of FA Black Tea or maybe as an enhancer in coffee type vapes.\"\n\n[User \"Amy2\" has quick reviews up on the ELR Forum.  Her take: \"Have no idea what this is a cigar ... I am not the person to review this. LOL.\" LOL indeed, \"Amy2\", LOL indeed.](http://forum.e-liquid-recipes.com/t/liquid-barn-tasting-notes/66705)\n\n[Liquid Barn's product page.  Their description: \"A traditional sweet leaf tobacco reminiscent of the robust smell from a warm pipe.\"  Liquid barn suggested mixing percentage is 10%.  This is 57% VG, which is interesting for a tobacco.](https://www.liquidbarn.com/products/sweet-pipe-tobacco-eliquid-extract)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Sweet Pipe Tobacco","url":"https://redd.it/7g92la","vendor":{"name":"Liquid Barn","code":"LB"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"LB","title":"Sweet Pipe Tobacco"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
