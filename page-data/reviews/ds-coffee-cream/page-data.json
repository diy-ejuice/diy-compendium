(Or maybe even closer to a caf√© latte)\n\n**Throat hit**: Low to mid-low. There aren't much a scratch here, as it is very mild and round.\n\n**Uses and pairings**: We are definitely into the coffee and dessert area here. The cream is very much on the heavy side here in the range of 1-3%. There are a slight taste of coffee in this range, but I really find the coffee to first make a good appearance at 4.5-5%. Its good for a coffee base, but you need more coffees to make it vibrant. Something like CAP Cappuccino V2 or so. Concering desserts, the good amount of cream would work very well in desserts. Heck even in custards, utilizing something like INW Custard or FA Custard Premium (don't do FA Custard - the citrus note would turn weird). Coffee flavored cream biscuit anyone? Sure, why not! I feel you'd really need to push this a little high, like 2.5-3% for an accent of coffee here. For stand-alone you can probably push it higher than 5%, but my maximum for this test was 5% and the coffee was still lacking a little. Although, the cream does work very well as a substitute for other creams and I do find it superior to something like any bavarian cream. Come to think of it, this flavor and vanilla would go very well. I can also see this being used in sweeter tobacco recipes. Avoid anything you'd find gross with a coffee.\n\n**Off-flavors**: As a start, let me be straight with you here. I find no traces of burnt popcorn or skunk wee in this, which is a huge plus. I also detect some low notes of caramel, which aren't bad, but I'm not sure if this was intended. At the back-end, I do notice a very low note of plastic around 3% and up, but again that might just be me being a little sensitive to that, as I have those issues with many custards too (yeah VT Banana Custard, screw you).\n\n**Notes**: As stated above, it does lack some deeper notes of coffee. If you're gonna make a straight up creamy coffee, you will need another coffee to back it up. Which ever you use is on you. If your mix turns sour, don't blame it on this flavor at least.\n\n[**DIY\\_eJuice Flavor Reviews**](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)","author":"Kittybit8","title":"Coffee Cream","url":"https://redd.it/eqw9b3","vendor":{"name":"DuraSmoke","code":"DS"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"DS","title":"Coffee Cream"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
