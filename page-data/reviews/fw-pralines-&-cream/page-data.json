Smooth through the nose and lungs. Moderate creamy mouth feel (no homo)\n\n**Flavor Properties**- I get swirls of caramel and nutty undertones with bits of crushed pecans. For those who have never had Pralines & Cream (in which case, I would ask what the fuck is wrong with u?), its actually caramel mixed in with pecan nuts with vanilla bean ice cream. unfortunately, i do not get much, or any at all, of vanilla bean ice cream\n\n**Relatable Flavors** - almost like a butter pecan ice cream, but less buttery, with more gooey caramel upfront \n\n**Off Flavors** - There is a bit of an aftertaste which i can't put my fingers on. I get the same taste with fw macadamia nut and a few other fw flavors. since it's so mild, i believe some basic layering will make it go away\n\n**Position In The Recipe** - Like a lot of FW flavors, this would be great as a base note. I could imagine making a really creamy and nutty ice cream with this. It could even work as an accent note, creamy, smooth, sweet and nutty. Similar to FW Hazelnut.\n\n**Pairings** - I would imagine this going well with other nuts (peanut butter, almond), or some kind of cream base (vanilla bean, fresh cream, etc). It might even work with fruits (if you like the juxtaposition of fruits and nuts). Feel free to add some FA Caramel or FW Caramel candy in there to reinforce the caramel notes.\n\n**End notes** - This is a great flavoring. If you like nutty and creamy flavors like FW Hazelnut or TFA Pistachio, I would recommend this one for sure. Also, be patient as I have a few more flavor reviews in the pipeline. Will be posting 'em later after I come back from dinner.
