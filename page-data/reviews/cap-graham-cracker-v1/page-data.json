    "result": {"data":{"reviewsJson":{"markdown":"**Setup:** Recoil w/ flavor barrel, Dual 15 wrap 26g 3mm Nifethal 70 coils @.18 ohms.  60w power, 450F temp limit. Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** CAP Graham Cracker v1 @ 4%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 19 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Moderately thick inhale with building sweet bakery cinnamon. Exhale brings out an almost marshmallow vanilla note shot through with cinnamon. Fluffy.  Light, sweet, and slightly grainy exhale, especially on the tail end. Dryer than you'd think something this sweet and fully flavored would be.  Nothing too rich here.  Almost an astringent lingering taste from the cinnamon.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Capellas bakery cinnamon notes taste a bit sour and metallic to me.  I get the same thing with Cinnamon Danish Swirl. Something creamy will take care of it pretty quickly though. More heat also seems to help.\n\n**Throat Hit:** 2/10.  Pretty inoffensive, especially considering the cinnamon here.\n\n**Uses:** Well, uhhh... things that use graham crackers.  Your smores and cheesecakes, etc.  Also used pretty heavily with custards to give an extra dimension of flavor.  Lots of mentions of using this in commercial clones.  Extra volume and cinnamon in bakeries. Try a little in pretty much any mix that the cinnamon won't throw off or that isn't going to be hurt by some dryness.  Would work as a tobacco enhancer for the right blend.\n\n**Pairings:** Anything? VBIC, Custards, Cheesecakes, Berries.  I'd stay away from already dry mixes but other than that knock yourself out.  I've seen talk about adding some butter to make this a bit richer.  Maybe AP to boost the graininess.\n\n**Notes:**  S&V tastes pretty linear up to 6%.  I think it would blend even at that level, but you'd be adding a ton of other concentrates to take the edge off of this one. I'd stick with an accent at 3% or under.  That cinnamon note isn't great, and I wouldn't want it standing out front.  The dryness would also be problematic. Blends really well at lower percentages though.  I'm obviously being a little trite when I suggest \"anything\" as a pairing but you'd be hard pressed to find something where this flavor wouldn't work.  The texture is the bigger issue, and so you want a thicker, sweet, creamy (dairy or not) base for this stuff to play off of.\n\nMakes a room smell awesome, for what that's worth.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[ELR flavor page, again.  Mostly positive, probably more aggressive on cinnamon and more realistic than TFA Graham Cracker Clear.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/1314)\n\nPositive, not particularly useful reviews on [BCF](http://www.bullcityflavors.com/graham-cracker-cap/) and [ECX](http://www.ecigexpress.com/diy-e-liquid/diy-e-liquid-flavors/capella-flavor-drops/graham-cracker-by-capella-flavor-drops.html#review-list)\n\n[Good general graham info and /u/helloiamyourpeepaw offers a quick review.  Heavy on the cinnamon, sweet and a bit crunchy.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/49dwp8/flavor_of_the_week_graham_cracker/)\n\n[Fleeting positive mentions in another reddit thread about graham crackers](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/3o1m4d/graham_cracker_stealthy_flavour_of_2015/)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Graham Cracker V1","url":"https://redd.it/5ezy7e","vendor":{"name":"Capella","code":"CAP"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"CAP","title":"Graham Cracker V1"}},
