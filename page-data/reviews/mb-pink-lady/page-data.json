Combination of floral & fruit notes: rose, hibiscus, maracuja and guava.\"\n\nMixed @ 5% steeped 2-3 days. Tested on derringer clone w/ .32ohm dual coil @ 45w.\n\nVery strong but not overwhelming. Not the biggest fan of floral flavors but I  would have no problem finishing a tank of this stuff. It's sweet, fruity, (but not overly fruity like fruit punch) and the floral notes seem to really help keep the sweetness at bay.\n\nAll in all, I think this flavoring has some good potential as not only a single flavor vape, but could be the foundation for something amazing.","author":"Twistedfexer","title":"Pink Lady","url":"https://redd.it/4d4ikk","vendor":{"name":"MolinBerry","code":"MB"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"MB","title":"Pink Lady"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
