    "result": {"data":{"reviewsJson":{"markdown":"**Percentage Used:** 10%\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Equipment Used:**  Troll RDA with a wickless single SS .8 ohm Clapton wrapped parallel with 26g SS at 19W.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**PG/VG:** 30/70\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Steep Time:** 3 Months\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Aroma:** Butter, popcorn, toffee/candy?\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Flavor Description:** Very authentic, slightly salty/sweet, mildly buttery. Surprisingly complex and well balanced with the right combination of popcorn to toffee to butter. Nice full mouth feel and body from the popcorn, it's mild enough to add to almost any biscuit, cookie, cake, pastry, donut just to boost the breadiness without the popcorn standing out. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:** None\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit:** 2/10\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Pairings:** Almost any flavored popcorn ball. Pie crusts, cookies, cakes, cereal, custards, nuts, tobaccos, muffins, biscuit, strawberry shortcake.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Notes:** Too weak for a SF at 10% for my tastes, thinking 12-15% will be nice. I can see this boosting both the buttery effect/flavor to any recipe, as well as body to bakeries in the 2-6% range.\n\n","author":"mysticrosell","title":"Kettle Corn","url":"https://redd.it/5n3ihw","vendor":{"name":"The Flavor Apprentice","code":"TFA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"TFA","title":"Kettle Corn"}},
