This is a great citrus fruity juicy along with being a sweet-tart flavoring.\n\n**Relatable Flavors** \n\nI've heard it described as flat 7UP or Sprite, would have to agree with that description, reminds me of a soda flavoring without the carbonation.\n\n**Position In The Recipe** \n\nAs a base - could be used in in a fruit base primarily focusing on Citrus flavors, and have seen it successfully used in candy bases.\n\nAs a accent - easily its most useful applications definitely has the ability to bring out sweet notes by adding contrast along with brightening creams.\n\n**Off Flavors**\n\nNot tasting anything with a Steep and have used this flavoring regularly, when I got this flavoring in notice the giant warning labels, (contains alcohol and to keep away from flames) and definitely noticed this note on a shake and Vape.\n\nI ordered a 4-ounce bottle and now that the alcohol has had time to evaporate not something I concern myself with it anymore, but you may want to watch out for it.\n\n**Pairings** \n\nCitrus, tropical fruits, dark fruits, Stone fruits, creams, bakeries, candies, candies,and Vanilla.\n\n**Recipe** \n\nNot one of my recipes, and I do use the flavoring in a few, but I figured I wanted simple and easy recipe for the review.\n\nÂ https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/9979#serially_easy_lime_yogurt_by_skiddlzninja\n\nAnd I'm sure I will get a godfuckingdammit Chris ðŸ˜‚ my talk-to-text has been acting very weird the last couple days I think it needs an update.\n\n**Notes**\n\nAlthough this flavoring flavoring this fantastic originally ordered it for my brother he wanted a stand-alone lemon lime, and regardless of the percentage I used it did not have the punch for a standalone flavoring.\n\nHere is a Wikipedia on lemon lime if you're interested in learning the history behind the flavoring.\n\nÂ https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemon-lime_drink\n\nAnd here is where I purchased mine.\n\nÂ http://www.bullcityvapor.com/lemon-lime-cap/\n\n**Rating** 97/100\n\n**Please if your opinion differs, or you have another review for this flavor add it in the comments.
