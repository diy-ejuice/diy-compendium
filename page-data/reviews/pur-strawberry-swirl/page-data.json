Creamy. Not cream. Almost like the strawberry and cream lifesavers.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Flavor Description:** Very artificial strawberry candy. A slight hint of creaminess, but not cream. I think it's trying to be a strawberry swirl lifesaver, but it's not. Very generic and very very sweet. At 4 weeks this hasn't changed much for me. Sweet artificial strawberry candy, still has a light hint of creaminess. I'm at a loss on what else to say about this one.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:** None\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit:** 1/10\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Pairings:** Almost any fruit. Whipped cream, vanillas, ice cream?\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Notes:** This is a pretty good strength for a stand alone, maybe 6-9%. If you like strawberry candy you will probably like this. I can't really think of anything I would use this in for a recipe. Please let me know if you come up with any good recipes with it.","author":"mysticrosell","title":"Strawberry Swirl","url":"https://redd.it/6dkp5s","vendor":{"name":"Purilum","code":"PUR"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"PUR","title":"Strawberry Swirl"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
