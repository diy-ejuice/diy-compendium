Max VG, steeped 7 days.\n* **Caution:** * None\n* **Flavor Description:** (From mnf website) A Very nice Bubblegum. (From me) This is essentially a pink bubblegum, but more on the chalky realm. It is similar to Bazooka Joe, Double Bubble, gum balls etc. \n* **Off-flavors:** It just has a chalky taste, but that goes along with the bubblegum nature.\n* **Throat Hit:**1/10\n* **Uses & Pairings:**This would go well with pretty mmuch any fruit. you could change your bubblegum to any fruit, mint, or anything like that. I would not suggest putting this in bakeries, but to each his own.   \n* **Notes:** This is the first Bubblegum flavoring I every got, back about 4 years ago and I still keep some on my flavor rack, if that helps you decide if this is a good bubblegum or not.\n\nIf you are looking for more mixing related content subscribe to my [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcfR6mXMRm-Iu3psoDrxGyA)\n\nKeep Mixing!","author":"cloudstatevapor","title":"Bubblegum","url":"https://redd.it/5wymxn","vendor":{"name":"The Flavor Apprentice","code":"TFA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"TFA","title":"Bubblegum"}},
