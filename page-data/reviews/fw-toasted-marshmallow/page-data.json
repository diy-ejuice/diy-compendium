Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FW Toasted Marshmallow@ %5, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 16 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Just some some slightly nutty toastyness and a fairly neutral sweet volume.  Doesn't seem to have much of a marshmallow kind of flavor underneath. I'm not picking the vanilla that most marshmallow flavors have, and the sweetness level doesn't seem as high as the other marshmallows.  Good mouthfeel, with that volume not having that same kind of dryness you can get out of marshmallows.  A bit weird solo, and can push towards cardboardy at a higher percentage.  As an additive, this is pretty intense and difficult to work with.  Useful at 1% and under to dry out, fluff up, and add a kind of gritty graham cracker texture more than a roasted flavor.\n\nSolo, inhale is dense with a good amount of volume. Not a whole lot of flavor. Dryer toasted top note. Fairly similar to the skin on a golden brown marshmallow with just a hint of a more chemical kind of smoke flavor.  Exhale doesn't have a really have a lot of flavor. Dense, lightly sweet base.  Doesn't have a raw VG taste to it, so it definitely has something going on there though.  Fairly light toasted marshmallow top notes. Starts out a bit nutty, gets a little chemical, and then finishes out with almost a graham cracker kind of cereal note.  Relatively clean finish, without any kind of overtly chemical taste.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Solo, the combination of volume and light flavor tastes a bit flat and grainy over 4%...t he dreaded cardboardy taste, pretty much. Doesn't seem to be an issue when mixed, although that grainy cereal note really comes out in other concentrates.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Nah, crazy smooth solo. Actually pretty cool, less dry and scratchy than other flavors that have this kind of volume.  In a mix, this does tend to try out other concentrates though and will add to throat hit as an additive.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  The big comparison here would be TFA Toasted Marshmallow, and this is worlds different. This is a lot more neutral in flavor, and it doesn't seem to have that weird warming thing that the TFA marshmallow has in spades. On the the plus side, the FW version doesn't have that chemical edge to it that the TFA Version does. So theoretically it should be a better fit for an actual toasted marshmallow, but it really knocks around the other concentrates in a mix. I don't know, I'd give this one a pass but I'm pretty weird about dry vapes and I don't want to have to be dumping a bunch of creamier ingredients into something to counteract the dryness here.\n\n**Notes:**  Talking about concentration, solo this seems to work best at 4% and under. Linear mixer, being noticeable at about 1% and just increasing in volume and (still light) flavor up until 4%.  Starting at 5%, it starts to get that flat cardboard tinge to it. I'm not digging this as a solo.\n\nS&V concentration testing as an additive to DIYFS Holy Vanilla @ 2%, This is noticeable down at .5%.  Seems to be lightening the Vanilla a bit, adding a noticeable amount of volume, and drying out the vape.  Also adding that graham cracker kind of dry, cereal note.  At 1%, volume is pushed up a bit more, vanilla is even more flat and dry, and that graham note is grittier. Seems to be about the useful limit here. I'm getting a whole lot of dryness when mixed over 1%.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nNot a whole lot out there.\n\n[The only substantive thing reviews I can find are on the BCF site, where this is getting pretty good ratings. Maybe I'm just using this wrong.](http://www.bullcityflavors.com/toasted-marshmallow-fw/)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Toasted Marshmallow","url":"https://redd.it/61b9b7","vendor":{"name":"Flavor West","code":"FW"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FW","title":"Toasted Marshmallow"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
