The name is misleading because it has no hint of salt imo but I am not too upset about it because this is a delicious caramel. \n\n**Off-flavors:** Nothing out of the ordinary here, taste like a rich creamy caramel\n\n**Throat Hit:** Very easy on the throat, smooth exhale\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  The sky is the limit to this. It is very versatile, whether you want to add a caramel to creams, custards, coffees or bakeries this is the one I am going to go to first, well, maybe second after fa caramel. I can see it being used in small amounts also to add a dark sweetness to mixes as well. \n\n**Notes:**\nThis flavor can really hold its own as the only caramel in a mix. I haven't steeped it so I imagine it will only get richer with time. I have only been using  fa caramel but am really glad I decided to add this to my last order on a whim it is very tasty. Mouthfeel isn't as thick as it tastes like it should if that makes sense. It is a dense, rich flavor but doesn't \"feel\" like it. Could use some help in that department. \n\n**Second Opinions:**\n[Some people get an inherent saltiness from this flavor on elr](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/5690).\n\n[Here is a recipe that uses this flavor as one component of caramel](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/23230#rollin_by_deweysuds)\n\nPlease if you have differing opinions leave a comment as I would love to get some other people's take on this flavor. More WF flavor reviews to come.\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"mlNikon","title":"Salted Caramel","url":"https://redd.it/5mc8w9","vendor":{"name":"Flavor West","code":"FW"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FW","title":"Salted Caramel"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
