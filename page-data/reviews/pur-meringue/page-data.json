I can't taste egg whites (good thing). Moderate caramelized/burnt sugar, no fluffy mouth feel at this point. Still very good and meringues usually require steeping to develop texture. Compared to FA, this one has more pronounced caramelization and less egg white, also less fluffy mouth feel. The PUR has better flavor, but texture is lacking. Will update with further steeping. Would I buy this over FA, yes. Even if it doesn't develop texture, the flavor is better and I can always add texture with other creams.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:** None\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit:** 1/10\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Pairings:** Almost any flavor to add sweetness. Peaches, bananas, desserts, cookies, pastries, cakes, pies, creams, custards, nuts, tobaccos.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Notes:** This is not a SF for me. I'm thinking 2-6% in blends.\n","author":"mysticrosell","title":"Meringue","url":"https://redd.it/5mx2bd","vendor":{"name":"Purilum","code":"PUR"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"PUR","title":"Meringue"}},
