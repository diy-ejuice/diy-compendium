I want to say maybe a plum-esque type of fruity. There’s a sweet type of tobacco here, but it’s almost perfume like. The dryness almost makes it feel smoky, but it doesn’t have a smoky taste to it. The perfume like tobacco with the fruitiness almost makes it more floral than anything. Might be an avenue to explore if a slightly floral tobacco sounds like it would tickle your fancy. There are some pyrazines in this bad boy. I think I’m picking up more of the tetramethyl Pyrazine more than the Acetyl Pyrazine. This doesn’t shout single flavor at me, but I think with some clever mixing it could find a place. I don’t get any cocoa, but see the second opinions for more on that. \n\n**Off flavors:** **BUTYRIC ACID WARNING!** The [SDS](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0542/2249/files/Indian_Tobacco-_flavor_essence_MSDS-final.doc?7782485695901594309) can be found on the product page on Nicotine River, and there you will see Isovaleric Acid. A quick google and you can find the [wiki page](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-Methylbutanoic_acid?wprov=sfti1) for this, and it is another name for methylbutyric acid. So if you are sensitive to the vomit/cheese/sweaty feet taste of Butyric acid, maybe pass on this flavor. I usually let my HS tobaccos steep about a month, and I never got the vomit taste from any of the DX or V2 flavors, so I guess it doesn’t bother me. But consider yourself warned! Edit to clarify: methylbutyric acid and Butyric Acid aren’t exactly the same, but if you check out the page on [TheGoodScents](http://www.thegoodscentscompany.com/data/rw1056411.html) you will see that it has a lot of the same odor and flavor properties. So they are like stinky feet brothers. \n\n**Pairings:** I would personally keep this away from dessert and bakery type of things. I’d use this more as a top note in an earthy recipe. I’d use a darker tobacco base, and maybe throw in something kind of woodsy. It’s honestly probably such a niche type of flavor that you’d probably have a better idea on how to use it than I would if the floral perfume like with Butyric acid hasn’t scared you off yet. \n\n**Second Opinions:** Not finding a whole lot. Generic “My favorite!” Review on Vaping Zone. [Couple of reviews]( https://m.banggood.com/Hangsen-Indian-Tobacco-Flavor-Electronic-Cigarette-Tobacco-Tar-Oil-reviews-p90800.html) on this site for the e-liquid that I assume uses this flavor. “Great vapor production!” Kind of tells you that they are pretty old. Had to translate the Spanish review, and it mentions popcorn toast. With all the pyrazines, I could see where they get that, but I don’t personally taste that. /u/RinVapes with a 5 Star review on [ELR](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/12174) with a slight sweetness/cocoa note. Some positive reviews comparing it to an analog on [BCF.](https://www.bullcityflavors.com/indian-flavoring-hs/) Another [review of the e-liquid](http://tastyvapers.blogspot.com/2013/08/review-6-tobacco-eliquids-from-hangsen.html?m=1) and this guy loved it saying, “It has the undeniable flavor of a tobacco cigarette, but there's something else going on here!  Is it fruity?  Is it chocolate?  I just don't know!  But I like it!  It's interesting, it's different, it's nice.”\n\nThere was a “review” posted last night that has since been removed, but it was more a review of Butyric acid, so there’s that. \n\n[DIY_Ejuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)","author":"ChemicalBurnVictim","title":"Indian Tobacco","url":"https://redd.it/7lq0bt","vendor":{"name":"Hangsen","code":"HS"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"HS","title":"Indian Tobacco"}},
