The strange thing is that as you’re vaping it at 6% the answer would be not really;\n\nbut the aftertaste & taste on lips *is* Elderflower, this makes me think there is sweet-spot percentage to be found, for those who want to achieve it. \n\n\nYou will have gathered, by now that this flavour is not for everyone.\nNot an \"easy\" flavour, even compared to other Floral flavours, which are not exactly mainstream.\n\nPersonally, I am interested in trying this with citrus and other bright flavours, \n\n\nhow that turns out remains to be seen.\n\n\n***Off-flavors:*** \na hint of DDT (at 3%), metallic (at 6%).\n\n***Throat hit***\nA standard Flavorah throat-hit (not much increase from 3 to 6%).\n\n***Uses***\n\nTo be confirmed.\n\n***Pairings***\nCitrus, Apple, and other bright flavours. \nTo be confirmed.\n\n***NB***\nWill edit this post when i get some conclusions.","author":"keed_spills","title":"Elderflower","url":"https://redd.it/4nvhld","vendor":{"name":"Flavorah","code":"FLV"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FLV","title":"Elderflower"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
