Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FA Pomegranate, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 6 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Darkly sweet with a bit of tartness, almost a pomegranate syrup. No higher floral notes or real sharp brightness but manages to capture some of the astringency of actual pomegranate.\n\nInhale is deep, sryupy sweetness. Definitely a pomegranate taste. I get some bitter floral top notes there too, but nothing unpleasant. Exhale has a dark, syrupy pomegranate right down the middle. I get just a hint of an almost cheesy coconut kind of sweetness.  It's really subtle though, and it could be something in this is just bringing that note out of the VG.  I don't get anything too floral in the top notes, although they pick up a bit of pomegranate astringency on the back half of the exhale. That astringency is light and totally in the profile, but it has a camphor effect. Dense mouthfeel, with a bit of wax to it.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  The tart astringency here has a camphor effect. It's not major but it's a bit distracting. I also get a really subtle kind of cheesiness to the fruit sweetness here. It's definitely mild, but it's following me as I tried a couple setups, so it's definitely there.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  I don't get a lot of throat hit here, seems fairly smooth to me.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Dark berries for sure. Something like FA Bilberry is going to bring back in some of the earthy astringency I'd want from a more realistic pomegranate.  Also a good excuse to use some FA Blackcurrant to play off the tartness here.\n\nVersatile mixer, while adding just a hint of mystery to a fruit mix.  Hard to place, but rarely unpleasant. I like it with mint and apple, but really it'll go with damn near anything.\n\nBakeries or creams might be a bit tricky. I'm not sure that camphor note is going to play all that nicely, but I've certainly been wrong about that kind of thing before.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nS&V concentration testing, .25-.75% is light but fairly bright, tart, and just a bit floral. Most of the secret sauce from the pomegranate, without a lot of body. 1% starts to get sweet and syrupy, but still fairly balanced. 1.5% picks up some that camphor, but the sweetness is still increasing it's pretty nice overall. 2% is getting pretty strong, with the off-notes starting to show up. 2.5% is getting a bit medicinal, and 3% is reading almost cough-dropish.  I'd mix with this at .75% as an accent note and 1.5% as a primary note in a fruit mix.\n\nAll in all, really good stuff.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[HIC Notes:](http://mamajsflavorshop.com/headinclouds-my-notes-on-flavor-descriptions/)\n\n\"Like fresh pomegranate, this is both sweet and tart, with a hint of the bitterness of the actual fruit. This is a very authentic flavor that will stand out in most recipes. It blends well with all the dark fruit and berry flavors. Orange makes a good sweetener. Lime and Coconut contrast well.\"\n\nGood, fairly useless reviews on [BCF](http://www.bullcityflavors.com/pomegranate-fa/) and [ECX](http://www.ecigexpress.com/diy-e-liquid/browse-flavorings/fruit-flavors/pomegranate-by-flavourart.html)\n\n[Here's the FOTW on Pomegranate.
