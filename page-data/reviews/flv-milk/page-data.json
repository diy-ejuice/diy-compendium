Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Milk @ 1% and 1 drop per 10 ml (about .25%), 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 9 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Heavier than straight milk, more like a flat cream flavor with some buttery and malty notes.  Under .5%, good hit of dairy flavor without tasting buytric or rancid, and stands up to higher heat pretty well. Dense texture, but not fluffy like a whipped cream.  At 1% that dairy gets a bit heavy and the maltiness gets a bit nutty, and the entire thing tastes like it's right on the verge or souring. I'd call it closer to a clotted cream up higher. Does a good job of tasting dense and rich with no DAAP, according to the [Flavorah GCMS](http://www.flavorah.com/wp-content/uploads/safety/flavorah_milk_gcms.pdf].  I'd use this an accent to add some richness and dairy realism to thinner creams like FA Fresh Cream at .1%-.4%.\n\nInhale is buttery, with a weird touch of sharpness in the top notes. Dense, but flat, with a lightly malty/nutty dairy note. A little bit sweet, but not like a full on sweetened whipped cream. Exhale is fairly flat, with that buttery cream up front, and some malty notes that get nutty as you increase the percentage. Exhale is just as dense as the inhale, and it seems to really coat your palate.  Lingers on quite a bit after vaping it.\n\n**Off-flavors:** I get a touch of a black licorice / anise to this, but it's pretty subtle under 1%.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light, but it comes and goes.  Kind of lodges in your throat a bit, if that makes any sense with vapor at all.  It's not really harsh, but it seems to kind of build up and get a bit dry.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This should have some interesting applications.  The easiest is to add some realism to wetter, thinner cream flavors.  It should work a lot like FW Hazelnut to add some malt back into a cereal recipe, with some added richness.\n\nI think the fact this gets sour but not rancid may also work in something like a cheesecake recipe, especially when you're trying to replicate something slightly savory like a sour cream cheesecake.\n\n**Notes:**  This is on the strong side of things.  I made a dilution of this for S&V concentration testing. At .1%, I get some milder malty and buttery notes, without a ton of heavier base. At .2%, you've got a good deal of buttery dense body, and that maltiness is getting more solid.  At .3%, this is closer to a heavy cream flavor, with that maltiness getting a bit sour.  Most real dairy has a touch of that sour note, and here it isn't unpleasant so much as realistic. .4% is pretty intense for me.  Thick, buttery, and just a bit nutty and sour. .5% may actually taste a little too realistic for me, and I'm getting a bit of a anise type of spice here. 1% is dense, buttery, and nutty. It tastes like it right on the edge of souring.  Just for laughs, I tried this at 2% and it wasn't working for me that high. It's nutty, sour, and a bit too rich.  I'd use this an accent at .1-.4%.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nNot a whole lot\n\n[ELR page is pretty sparse. Two notes, one saying mix it low at .5-1%, and the other 3%](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/129975)\n\n[Here's the Flavorah product page. Their description: \"Why aren't you searching for cream, Is it because you think you are fat? You know, you could drink 2% if you wanted. This milk is for cereal and other dairy vape needs. It is a base flavor, white and flat like a canvas.\"](http://store.flavorah.com/concentrated-milk-flavor)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Milk","url":"https://redd.it/6ci7vq","vendor":{"name":"Flavorah","code":"FLV"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FLV","title":"Milk"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
