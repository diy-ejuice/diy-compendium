Well we can all thank /u/ID10-T for blackmailing me into this.\n\nRight off the first pull I get a burnt flavor that slightly resembles a breading flavor, but I have to stretch my imagination out quite a bit. It's rather quite disgusting to be honest. This doesn't remind me of fried chicken at all. It tastes like the burning underlings of the stuff on the bottom of your shoe. I'm not getting any bready notes at all. There is a slight basil flavor i'm getting from this but it's more of a rubbed the basil leaves in dirt and ate it kind of flavor. I'm not getting any chicken flavor from this at all. I'm not sure who made this and said \"yeah, that's fried chicken\" but they were wrong. The only thing I'm really getting from this is the flavor of not changing your wick for a month and vaping on it. I'm not sure how many more words I need to type out to tell you that this flavor is what getting disowned by your parents feels like. RF Fried Chicken was funny to vape; this is some sort of cruel joke that you wouldn't even let your worst enemy vape this trash.\n\n**Off Flavors**: Everything about this? The burnt flavor this gives off the so off putting that this is useless for vaping.\n\n**Throat Hit**: All things considered this a smooth disgusting vape.\n\n**Uses / Why?**: My advice for pairings would be not to use this at all. As much as I didn't like RF Fried Chicken they did this flavor a hell of a lot better than this abortion of a flavor did. RF's version had relatable flavors that you could say were fried chicken at least. I would personally pull out $5.99 and throw it in the trash and burn it. Then you'll have a close aroma to OoO Fried Chicken.\n\n**Second Opinions**: I was only able to find one review for this flavor and they made biscuits with them. Which is probably a better idea.\n\n> This flavor was delicious with the home baked biscuits I made for our Sunday family brunch. I made over 3 dozen that were gone by the end of the meal.","author":"chewymidget","title":"Fried Chicken","url":"https://redd.it/782w75","vendor":{"name":"One On One","code":"OOO"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"OOO","title":"Fried Chicken"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
