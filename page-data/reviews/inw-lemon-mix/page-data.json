Reminds me of the lemon juice you add to coke or water. Fresh, sour, very juicy, slightly bitter and a tad watery. Not sweet but not completely dry in sweetness.\n\n**Off flavors:** Very harsh and bitter aftertaste when vaping with almost dried out wicks. No off flavors with wet wicks.\n\n**Throat hit:** 4/10 moderate, rather smooth for a citrus flavoring.\n\n**Pairings:** Drinks, fruits, candies and other citruses. Excellent lemon/grapefruit base for alcoholic beverages.\n\n**Notes:** I was impressed with this one when I first tried it, one of the better citrus flavorings I've tried so far. It's fairly similar to FA Lemon Sicily, but lacks pithy note I get from it at over 0,5%, and doesn't have nearly as much of throat hit. Though I haven't messed with this flavoring much yet, mixing it with INW Lemon and a bit of sucralose gave me a promising start for a sour lemon candy recipe. Good mixing range would probably be at 0,5-1,5%; it's pretty strong stuff and likely overpowers more subtle notes in your mix.\n\n(This is my first post to this sub and I'm not used to reddit's formatting.
