Use it like you would cinnamon in the culinary world.  \n\nIt is a tad steep at $12.50/15ml, but it is well worth it. Not only is it the best bakery cinnamon available, it is super concentrated; you won't be using this one any higher than 0.5%. I've found this to add the perfect accent to a bakery as low as 0.15%, and makes for a great flavorful cinnamon kick at 0.3%. What I find particularly awesome about this flavoring its range. Keep in mind though, if you want to bring it way up for a spicy, red-hot cinnamon, you may want a different cinnamon since this one gets pretty dry for me over 0.75%, but the dryness does calm down after some steep time.  \n\nIt is kind of hard to work with as is, so making a dilution of this one (10% FLV Rich Cinnamon:90% PG) may make it easier to handle.\n\n**On the Nose**  \nA deep, rich, spicy cinnamon; smells semi-sweet\n\n**Usage**  \n*Stand alone*: 0.5%. Not sure why you would vape this solo, but hell, you can!\n\n*In a mix*: <0.1-0.5% Depending if you're looking for a touch of spice, or a hearty baked cinnamon.\n\n**Throat**  \nMild, when used at recommended %s; gets dry at higher %s\n\n**Pairings**  \n*Bakeries*, Creams, apple, banana, pear, caramel, butterscotch, tobacco. \n\n**Avoid**  \nCitrus, melons, tropical profiles (you might be able to work it, but it will be difficult).\n\n**Steep**  \n3-4 days. Spices don't generally need a lot of time, but since this one is so concentrated, it's a good idea to let it homogenize.\n\n**Quick Recipe: Apple Filling**  \n*Ratio: 15PG/85VG*  \n*Steep: 3-4 Days*  \n\n* FA Fuji @ 2%  \n* FA Liquid Amber @ 1%  \n* FLV Rich Cinnamon @ 0.5%  \n* TFA Brown Sugar Extra @ 0.75%  \n\nNot my most proud recipe, but a fairly simple one that really lets the FLV Rich Cinnamon shine. You really get to push it to the limit here and let the main profile be that delicious bakery cinnamon, sitting on top of a baked apple with just a touch of brown sugar to sweeten it up.  \n\n##**Awesome Recipes**##\n\n**[Awesome Apple Pie](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/3gjxcs/awesome_apple_pie_recipe/)** by /u/Botboy141  \n**[Dutchie - A Delicious Stroopwafel](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/4e7snt/dutchie_a_delicious_stroopwafel/?ref=search_posts)** by /u/RuntDastardly  \n\nNot my recipes, but thank you to the creators for perfectly using this amazing ingredient. I feel like these two recipes play on the opposite ends of the spectrum of FLV Rich Cinnamon to show its versatility and at only a difference of 0.15%.  \n\n* At 0.3%, Botboy141's Apple Pie lets FLV Rich Cinnamon *sort of* be the star of the show. What you get is a great flakey crust, and an amazing apple pie filling that is perfectly balanced between apple and cinnamon, pushing the FLV Rich Cinnamon to its boundaries and really showing you what this flavor is all about.   \n\n* At 0.15%, RuntDastardly's Dutchie is using just a touch of the cinnamon to accent the mix. What this does here is really give some depth and flavor to the waffle, as well as accenting the maple/brown sugar/brulee cream mixture to bring this mix in to a different realm. You really don't even notice it the cinnamon, but it's what pushes an already great recipe in to perfection.
