Slight throat hit.    \n\n\n**Throat Hit**\n\n\n\n4/10\n\n\n\n**Flavor Properties**\n\n\n\nTastes just like bitter almond with a sugar glaze with a faint honey note. Slightly toasty. \n\n\n\n**Relatable Flavors**\n\n\nMarzipan. Jordan Almonds. Amaretto.    \n\n\n**Off Flavors**\n\n\nNot an off flavor but for a sweeter almond extract type flavor go with FA Almond instead.  \n\n\n**Position In The Recipe**\n\n\nThis is a pretty tasty standalone vape although somewhat two-dimensional. This is a great alternative sweetener, and is especially good for giving a toasted almond flavor to bakery recipes and adding a touch of sweetness.     \n\n\n**Pairings**\n\n\nBakery, Stone Fruits (cherry, peach, apricot, plum), Apple, Fig, Cream, Vanilla, Other nuts, Orange, Banana, Caramel, Coffee, Honey, Pear\n\n\n**Notes**\n\n\nTo mix things up a bit, I like using this as a modifier for orange in bakery recipes. I also like this as a topnote in a pistachio ice cream recipe that I may release someday but I’m still playing with. I really like the smell of this concentrate right from the bottle. Actually, I think that’s my favorite part about this concentrate. If you like keeping aroma molecules around just to smell, this one is a must buy. Seriously, this flavor smells amazing. \n\n\n\n\n**Recipes**\n[HIC's Amaretto Disoranno recipe](http://vapingunderground.com/threads/hics-amaretto-disoranno.1848/)\n\n\n[ELR Sorted by Rating](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/3065?exclsingle=0&filter=0&sort=score&direction=desc#recipes)\n\n\n**Purchasing Information**\n\n\n[Bull City Vapor](http://www.bullcityvapor.com/marzipan-fa/)\n\n\n**Price** \n\n\n$2.49/10mL \n\n\n$4.99/30mL \n\n\n$12.99/120mL\n\n\n**Rating** *87.2/100* \n\n\nIf you disagree, well that’s just like, your opinion man.\n\n\n(But you should write that down there in the comments) \n","author":"ClaptonBurns","title":"Marzipan","url":"https://redd.it/4vg7pb","vendor":{"name":"Flavour Art","code":"FA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FA","title":"Marzipan"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
