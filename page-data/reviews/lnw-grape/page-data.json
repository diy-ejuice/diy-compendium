    "result": {"data":{"reviewsJson":{"markdown":"**Setup:** Goon LP, dual parallel 25g SS316L @0.1 ohms, 100w, full cotton wicks\n\n**Testing:**[Liquid Nicotine Wholesalers Grape](https://liquidnicotinewholesalers.com/lnw-grape.html) @5% steeped three days\n\n**Flavor Description:** Somewhere between sugary grape Kool-aid and grape Pez candy. This tastes very sweet throughout. This has that same chalkiness that the pineapple does. The grape flavor is pretty much an artificial, candy type grape. \n\n**Off-flavors:** Chalkiness. I want to clarify that it's not off-putting. This is just not a realistic grape taste.\n\n**Throat hit:** A little dry.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:** Grape drank, Grape soda (actually this has great grape soda potential), Grape candy, Grapey stuff of all kinds. just keep this away from anywhere you want a realistic grape.\n\n**Notes:** It is starting to look like the \"fruit\" flavors from LNW are fruit flavored candy concentrates. I still have a tester of blueberry to try though. I want to make it clear that that is not necessarily a bad thing. If you like candy profiles these will be worth picking up.\n\n**Second Opinions:** Nothing yet!\n\n\n","author":"PerennialPhilosopher","title":"Grape","url":"https://redd.it/68ju8d","vendor":{"name":"Liquid Nicotine Wholesale","code":"LNW"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"LNW","title":"Grape"}},
