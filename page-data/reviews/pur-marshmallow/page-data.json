It tastes just like that plastic tub of light and fluffy marshmallow creme. Slightly sweet, moist, airy, and a light vanilla. At a 2 week steep this has lost that sticky marshmallow cr√®me it had before, and has developed into the most realistic marshmallow flavor I have tasted yet, even down to the powdery sweet outside of the marshmallow and the fluffy but still chewy body/mouthfeel. Except....vanilla. It still seems to have a noticeable vanilla flavor to me, which may put a few limitations on what you can mix it with, but very few as most things taste great with vanilla. Maybe it's the sweetness that I am reading as vanilla? I will be very interested in hearing other's opinions. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:** Vanilla\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit:** 1/10\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Pairings:** Almost any fruit. Cookies, cakes, cereal, creams, custards, nuts, tobaccos, bakeries, desserts. Almost anything.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Notes:** Have I mentioned that I love this? And yes, that is very subjective and you may hate it with a passion. Like I hate FA Joy when I'm craving a flat warm beer, like never! This is going to be an amazing additive for sweetness and/or body. If you like marshmallow as a single flavor, I would recommend 6-8% in an RDA  and for a tank around 7-9%. As an accent anywhere from .5-5% depending on the flavor or effect you are trying to achieve.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Comparison:** CAP's is also very sweet, but is missing that body/mouthfeel and doesn't really taste like marshmallow to me, just generic sweetness. FA is a very good marshmallow, it has a sweet and mild marshmallow flavor that has a fantastic thick mouth feel and body. The marshmallow flavor is delicate and usually overwhelmed easily with the addition of addition flavors. I use it as a sweetener and body enhancer rather than flavor. RF is very similar to FA in that it's a great sweetener and body enhancer with a very mild actual marshmallow flavor. PUR's version actually has a moderate to full marshmallow flavor itself along with body and it's not just a generic sweetness. But, as I've only tested the single flavor so far I'm not sure how strongly the flavor itself will stand out against other flavors.","author":"mysticrosell","title":"Marshmallow","url":"https://redd.it/5qz7m4","vendor":{"name":"Purilum","code":"PUR"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"PUR","title":"Marshmallow"}},
