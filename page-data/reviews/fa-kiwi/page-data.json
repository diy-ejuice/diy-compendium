It works very well as a Standalone great flavour and smells great. It seems a strong flavour at 3% so tame this down I can't see it altering the profile especially if combining with other fruits. It will go awesome with Strawberry, melon,berries etc and should allow other fruits to pop.   \nIf you want super sweetness jazz this flavour up with a little marshmallow.  \n\nNot much more to say really authentic if slightly candy but again another winner from flavourart.\n\n**Notes**  \n\nGreat flavour, candy,sweet,fresh,ripe  \n\nStandalone 1-3%  \nIn a recipe0.25-2%  \n\n*Please if your opinion differs, or you have another review for this post it in the comments. Will help the master list with multiple reviews in one spot.*","author":"CheebaSteeba","title":"Kiwi","url":"https://redd.it/4rh0og","vendor":{"name":"Flavour Art","code":"FA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FA","title":"Kiwi"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
