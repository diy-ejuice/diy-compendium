They do however suggest SOLO:5-9% MIXED:1-5%\n\n**5%:** Fresh it had a light subtle oaky note with some char and smoke. Then week 1-3 the char and smoke had faded out. Just a very light wood note was all that was left. Didn't seem harsh or dry. Didn't seem thin either.\n\n**9%:** Has a whiskey/bourbon smell to it. Whiskey/bourbon is also coming through on the vape. Charred smokiness is more noticeable. Oak woodiness is more powerful as well. No harshness, seems moist, has a decent body and no terrible off flavors.\n\n**Pairings:** Would go great with tobaccos or whiskey/bourbon cocktails \n\n**Conclusion:** This flavor seems like it is meant to be used in the higher percentage range. If your wanting the whiskey char notes use closer to the 5% range in a mix. If you're only wanting a light wood note use in the 1-2% range in a mix. At 9% I really enjoyed this as a solo, also seems to need little to no steep time.
