I wouldn't call it a 1:1 to the actual cereal it mimics, but it is pretty damn close.  This flavor also seems to get pretty intense at higher temps.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Gets a little over-grainy if you go much above 6%, almost like dry cracked corn.\n\n**Throat hit:** 7/10, it's definitely above average for me \n\n**Uses:** Start around 2-4%, but it seems much above 6% a little of that corn/grain note starts to comes out. This flavor would be ideal in a cereal recipe or even some bakery type mixes.\n\n**Pairings:**   This flavor begs to be paired with something creamy or milky.  A dash or two of your favorite fruit(s) would also help turn it up a notch.  \n\n**Notes:** This isn't a great standalone for me but it does make for a great additive in a recipe. The grainy note tends to be barely noticeable with most dairy/cream additions.\n \nFlavor available at BCV [here](http://www.bullcityflavors.com/crunchy-berry-cereal-tfa/) and is listed as \"Crunchy Berry Cereal\".\n\n[Link to e-liquid-recipes notes on this flavor](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/14179)\n\n[Link to all of our flavor reviews in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)\n","author":"wh1skeyk1ng","title":"Berry Cereal","url":"https://redd.it/5p1lfe","vendor":{"name":"The Flavor Apprentice","code":"TFA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"TFA","title":"Berry Cereal"}},
