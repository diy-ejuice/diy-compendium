Everything that’s great.\n\nSmell test - Sweet, Cream, Vanilla, & Custard without eggs.\n\nDay 1 - Throat hit 1/10. Tastes like the label, creamy buttery cookie. But maybe more Butter Biscuit than Butter Cookie. You could easily go either way if you wanted. Delicious with a nice sweetness and butter right off the shake. Not dry or harsh at all. I could vape this solo.\n\nDay 3 - Throat hit 1/10. Smooth and much of the same as Day 1. Getting a gooey butter/sweet mouthfeel. Like CAP Sugar Cookie but not as sweet and more chewy/gooey. Getting a faint spice note I don’t have a description for that will probably just get bullied in a mix. Chewy and Sweet Butter Cookie with a creamy note. Starting to also remind me of a light INW Biscuit that isn’t dryish.\n\n…………………………………………\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is a great flavor that works great with all bakery and cookie. No off notes that I could tell plus it’s smooth and sweet with a chewy mouthfeel. Use to support biscuits, cookies, or pie crusts. I can see this going well with custards, chocolates, creams, vanilla, cakes, milks, caramels, and toffee. Anything bakery. For a touch of butter accent 0.25% - 1%. As a dominant note 1% - 2%. Solo 2.5% - 3%.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Pistachio Cookie Custard Kuri_mix](http://tjek.nu/r/Bh6K)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCo. | Flavor | %   \n---|---|----\nFA | Coconut (Coco, Cocco) | 0.2\nFA | Cookie (Biscotto) | 1\nWF | Cookie Butter (SC) | 1.5\nTFA | Pistachio | 4\nTFA | Vanilla Custard II | 3","author":"kuri_sanTou","title":"Cookie Butter","url":"https://redd.it/jp9px0","vendor":{"name":"Wonder Flavors","code":"WF"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"WF","title":"Cookie Butter"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
