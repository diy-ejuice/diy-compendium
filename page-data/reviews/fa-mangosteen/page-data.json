I would describe this as somewhere *between* a sweet pink grapefruit and a dark cherry or light blueberry.  Very unique taste and slightly sharp on the tongue.\n\nOff-flavors: Gets a bit floral above 2 or 3%, but fades after a decent steep.\n\nThroat hit: 6/10\n\nUses: Great for a summer time or tropical mix.  Could also be used to give boring or tart fruit flavors an sweet boost without over-powering a blend.  This could also possibly be used in a pinch to mimic some of the juiciness of INW Cactus at very low percentages, but it is definitely not the same thing by any means, especially once you compare the two flavors over 1-2%.\n\nPairings: Tropical flavors.  Also, citrus, peach, strawberry, apple, or basically any fruits needing a sweet little boost.\n\nNotes: I would like to thank /u/id10-t for suggesting this on my last order.  It's very pleasant and refreshing as a standalone, and I can also see it being a great addition in any fruit recipe.\n\nEDIT: Forgot to state that this does not taste like a mango, nor is it intended to, as a *mangosteen* is something different.\n\n[Bonus link to mangosteen fruit on wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purple_mangosteen)\n\nEDIT: [Link to all of our flavor reviews in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)","author":"wh1skeyk1ng","title":"Mangosteen","url":"https://redd.it/54i557","vendor":{"name":"Flavour Art","code":"FA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FA","title":"Mangosteen"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
