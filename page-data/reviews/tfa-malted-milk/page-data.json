    "result": {"data":{"reviewsJson":{"markdown":"**Setup:** Geekvape Tsunami 24mm; 7 wrap 24/32awg kanthal dual claptons @ .32Î©; cotton wicks; 60 W\n\n**Testing:** The Flavor Apprentice - Malted Milk @ 1% & 3%; Aged: 18 days\n\n**Flavor description:**  Malt forward, almost caramel or toffee like with a hint of dark nuttiness and a bit of a boozy note somewhere in the middle.  Not a lot of milk taste if you will, but definitely thick in the mouth and dark tasting.  At 3% it comes off as a bit dry, almost chalky, like a Whopper candy but without the chocolate coating and tastes slightly reminiscent of Kahlua liquor.\n\n**Off-flavors:** The alcohol note along with the apparent lack of actual milkiness.  Some people report a sickly sour note which I suppose could be attributed to the fact that it is a dairy flavor, or maybe it was used at too high of a %.\n\n**Throat hit:** 2/10 Pretty smooth\n\n**Uses:**  0.25-1.5% is probably going to be an acceptable range for this flavor to add thickness/mouthfeel, though I would definitely start low and work up as preferred.  Much above that and it gets rather funky and can easily over-power and mute other flavorings.\n\n**Pairings:**  Use with TFA Dairy Milk in a cereal milk base.  Would also go well with other creams, nut/grain/cereal or AP, vanilla, caramel, chocolate, custard, maybe cookie, or even cinnamon.  Berries would also be a decent pairing, but it may be tricky to nail down the percentages as to not mute them.\n\n**Notes:** Not a standalone for me.  This flavor is proving to be rather tricky to use and is going to be more of a small % additive as it is rather over-bearing and funky.  This concentrate also has a very subjective taste and may not be enjoyable to everyone.\n\nFlavor available at BCV [here](http://www.bullcityflavors.com/malted-milk-tfa/) \n\n[Link to e-liquid-recipes notes on this flavor](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/2374)\n\n[Link to all of our flavor reviews in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)","author":"wh1skeyk1ng","title":"Malted Milk","url":"https://redd.it/5qox01","vendor":{"name":"The Flavor Apprentice","code":"TFA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"TFA","title":"Malted Milk"}},
