Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Hangsen Ginger @ %2, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 17 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** A spicy ginger flavor with a slightly syrupy neutral base. Definitely warm, moderately dense.  About halfway between a bakery dried ginger and a crystalized ginger candy flavor.  Warmth gets more pronounced on the exhale and is pretty consistent throughout.  Nothing too weird or complex, just ginger.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Nah. Has some syrupy body there, but it's pretty neutral.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Not really. I mean, it's ginger so there's some definite heat and spice there, especially on the exhale.  But... ginger, so that's kind of what you're going for.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:** Pretty versatile stuff. Should work damn near anywhere you want some ginger.\n\nGood way of getting ginger into your bakeries without dealing with all that holiday spice baggage.\n\nPairs well with fruits, especially apple, pears, and peaches.  Also works with citruses.\n\nPretty good potential for candies, tea, cocktails. The world is your gingery oyster.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nS&V Concentration testing, .5% gives you a nice little kick of ginger without much of that sweet body. 1% has a bit more spice, but nothing crazy. Mostly an increase in the sweet body of the concentrate. 1.5% is pushing ginger candy but no drastic ramp up of the spiciness. 2% is starting to get sweet, and that actually seems like it tempering that spice a bit.  3% is still spicy, but it's reading a lot like a ginger hard candy.  I'd start at .5% in a mix for bakeries or any other mix where you just want a touch of ginger spiciness. Bump it to 1.5% if you want some sweetness as well as ginger for a fruit mix. Go all the way to 3% for a ginger candy base.\n\nNot as strong as I expected.  Mixed this tester at 2% fully ready to cut it way back so it didn't blow my sinuses out. It did not.  Seems to lose just a bit of the punch on the steep.\n\nA really nice suprise. Just a ginger flavor, pretty cool.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nNah, not that I can find.
