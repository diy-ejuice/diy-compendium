I get the walnut but not the roasted part of it. More of a fresh, slightly green walnut, if that makes any sense. It might do well in a mix but I don't like it as a standalone.\"\n\nFrom me: Wood and walnuts. It almost tastes like FA Black Fire before the fire is lit, if you can imagine that. Very strong at 3%. \n\n**Off-flavors:** I wouldn't say there's anything \"off\" from what was intended. Just very strong. Wouldn't use as a stand alone. More a background note to be used in the .5%-1% max range. \n\n**Throat hit:** Bites the tongue, but pretty easy on the throat. \n\n**Uses:** In the back of a tobacco mix. You'll want to think \"hmm, there's something interesting in there, but I can't quite place it.\" Go above 1% at your own risk. \n\n**Pairings:** Tobacco, nuts, maybe worth a shot in a fruity tobacco. I'll probably try it along side FA Black Fire and see how that goes. \n\n**Notes:** All the notes I have on it are included above. I bought this flavor once before, but never used it when I smelled it. Decided to give it a fair shot. Gonna try it somewhere. Most likely in a rework of my 555 mix. \n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ChemicalBurnVictim","title":"Little Space Drop","url":"https://redd.it/5mqxv5","vendor":{"name":"Inawera","code":"INW"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"INW","title":"Little Space Drop"}},
