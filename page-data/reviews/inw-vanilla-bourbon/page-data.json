Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** INW Vanilla Bourbon @ 2%, 60% VG, 40% VG, Steeped 30 days\n\n**Flavor Description:** A relatively clean, commercial fluffy vanilla flavoring. A lot like a cream soda, or canned frosting type of vanilla. Strong resemblance to a marshmallow.  Very similar to INW Vanilla Shisha, although less creamy.  Dense and sweet, non-floral but a bit simple for a vanilla..\n\nInhale is all sweet fluffy vanilla. Nothing dark or complex here, but still really tasty. Exhale is more of the same, really. I'm going to say fluffy again, just because it's so pronounced. Natural tasting sweetness, almost a bit cloying. Vanilla note is clear and bright, but no richer dark flavors or floral top notes. A solid vanilla-heavy marshmallow, all the way.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Not bad, but pretty damn close to a marshmallow flavor.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Light to moderate throat hit. Sweetness here just hits my throat wrong.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This would work as a marshmallow... so the million and a half uses that people have found for that. Thickens creams, fluffs out pastries, adds sweetness and body to thinner mixes.  The sweetness is just a bit overbearing for me here, and so I'd watch that.\n\nToo fluffy for custards and rich buttery bakeries.  Vanilla note reads too candy for anything particulary complex.\n\nGood vanilla note for a thicker frosting. A bit cleaner and brighter than FLV Frosting, but less complex and rich. Honestly, INW Vanilla Shisha would work better just because of the added creaminess and richness, but this could be a good stand-in.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nVery light coloring, almost clear.\n\nS&V Concentration testing, this is a nice bright vanilla at 1%, anything lower and it feels like a bit of a waste as the sweetness and vibrancy just doesn't come through. 1.5% starts to get fluffy and by 2% that marshmallow really kicks in.  I'd mix at 1% as a bright vanilla, and 2% if you want to go full mallow.  Anything higher gets too sticky sweet for me, and the throat hit gets a bit rough and dry.\n\nSeriously though, just use INW Shisha Vanilla.\n\n[**TFA Vanilla Bourbon Flavor Review**](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/5lqdpb/tfa_vanilla_bourbon/)\n\n[**FA Vanilla Bourbon Flavor Review**](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/5lqejv/fa_vanilla_bourbon/)\n\nReally simple take on the available Vanilla Bourbon concentrates: INW reads marshmallow, TFA reads malty extract, and FA reads as a warm vanilla additive.  I'd use INW for strong, bright marshmallowy vanilla in a fruit mix or over the top rich mixes, TFA for heavy custards and bakeries without spice, and FA for lighter creams and bakeries with a bit of spice as well as nutty or tobacco mixes.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[ELR notes are really sparse. Only useful one is: \"a bit dry, not as round as shisha vanilla.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/2275)\n\n[Couple mentions on Vaping Underground as a light, bright vanilla.](http://vapingunderground.com/threads/looking-for-a-light-bright-vanilla-flavoring.190277/)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Vanilla Bourbon","url":"https://redd.it/5lqd8s","vendor":{"name":"Inawera","code":"INW"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"INW","title":"Vanilla Bourbon"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
