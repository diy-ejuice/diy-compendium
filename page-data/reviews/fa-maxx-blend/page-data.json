Not the kind from the mix, but stuff you make from scratch with dark cocoa powder. Creamy without being too much. It still has the cherry/blueberry notes to me, but they're more of a flavor mixed into the hot chocolate than the dried berries with cocoa nibs I was getting originally.\n\nOff flavors: I don't personally get any off flavors from this, except that it seems to stick on your palate for a while after the exhale, kinda like tpa papaya did for me. I don't like that about it, but it's overall not off at all imo.\n\nReview: at least 8/10. I really like this flavor. I don't feel like it's really a tobacco, just not a fruit flavor. It's not quite a dessert flavor like ry4, and I like it better than FA ry4, but it's sorta in the same genre of not-exactly-tobacco tobacco's.\n\nThroat hit: I give it maybe 1/10 but that may be subjective\n\nPairings: could go with dark berries, maybe apple, other tobacco's, caramel, desserts, nuts, heavy creams. \n\nNotes: I would place this as good for somebody who's tired of fruit and sweet mixes but isn't really into tobacco.\n\nThis is my first flavor review, I'm not u/concreteriver but I want to contribute some. Hope this helps somebody!","author":"[deleted]","title":"Maxx Blend","url":"https://redd.it/5ivvsk","vendor":{"name":"Flavour Art","code":"FA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FA","title":"Maxx Blend"}},
