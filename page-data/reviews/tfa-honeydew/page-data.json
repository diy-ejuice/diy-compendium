I will report back.*\n\n##**Main Notes:**##\n\nTFA Honeydew is very sweet, fruity and fresh. It's not a spot on, realistic honeydew; more of a candy-like version. \n\n##**Developement:**##\n\nAt 2% it is thin, more fresh and watery. The background notes come to the front after a short steep.\n\nAt 5% you got yourself a really bold honeydew flavor. At =<5% it seems to hit the sweet spot, giving you a very clear flavor profile.\n\nAt 10% it started off very strong - the sweetness and the fruityness diminished almost completely, leaving you with some muted honeydew volatiles. \n\n##**Recommended Percentage and Steep:**##\n\nI would recommend 2-5% for standalone flavor and a short steep (overnight to 3 days).\n\n\n\n##**Toxicity**##\nVolatile | contains\n---|---\nAcetoin | \nDiacetyl |  \nAcetyl Propionyl|  \n\n##**Other:**##\nTFA has Honeydew and Honeydew II flavoring. I suspect I tested the II version.\n\n***\n\nMy testing setup:\nGriffin RTA, Dual Kanthal Coils reading at 0.5, 30 Watts.\n\nI make 3 10ml bottles (3mg nicotine, 50/50 PG VG) and steep them for 4 weeks. I test them after 1, 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days.","author":"SONDERvape","title":"Honeydew","url":"https://redd.it/4kudhk","vendor":{"name":"The Flavor Apprentice","code":"TFA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"TFA","title":"Honeydew"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
