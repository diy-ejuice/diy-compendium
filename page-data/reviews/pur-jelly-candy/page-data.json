The taste is so realistic I swear it feels like it's been coated with sugar. This smells AMAZING!  \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:** Very artificial and sugar is overpowering the first 2-3 days. Steeps out.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit:** 2/10\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Pairings:** Any fruit. Or combination of fruits. Candy. Jams and jellies, donut filling.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Notes:** I think this will add a candy like flavor to almost any artificial flavored fruit and a jelly/jam flavor to fresh fruit flavors at the right strength. With the addition of fruits I can see it being a very authentic jelly candy in the 5-7% range, and a jam or jelly in the neighborhood of 1.5-3%. If it strengthens much more with a longer steep I will probably bump them down a little.","author":"mysticrosell","title":"Jelly Candy","url":"https://redd.it/5mwzzb","vendor":{"name":"Purilum","code":"PUR"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"PUR","title":"Jelly Candy"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
