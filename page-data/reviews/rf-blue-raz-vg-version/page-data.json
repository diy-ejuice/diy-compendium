If anyone knows anything I should do differently feel free to let me know. I promise I won't cry ;) Maybe...lol\n\n&nbsp;\n\nPlease understand these are just my opinions, and I have only been mixing for about 8 months. I hope it helps. These flavors really do need at least a 4 week steep to fully develop the flavors. VG just doesn't carry the flavor like PG. However, even using higher percentages, if they are single flavors it's not using any more flavoring than they usual 15-20% of combines flavors that is commonly used with a lot of flavoring. These are not super concentrated like INW or FA.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Blue Raz**\n\n- Tested 10% @ 1 week steep. Well, to be honest, I have never had blue raspberry. And I know that blue raspberry slushy probably tastes nothing like the real fruit, I have no clue. But this tastes very much like a blue raspberry slushy. Without being sickening sweet, nor artificial. I need to order Koolada. I bet it would take this over the top for summer. I've always been a custard and dessert vaper, so not sure where to go with it. It's very good, just a bit out of my comfort zone. Will have to find my imagination for this one. Is a bright medium sweet berry, very different from all the usual berries when you want something to break the monotony.\n- At a 4 week steep. This has gotten noticeably sweeter, and raspberry has moved a little more to the front. This is less slush now that it has steeped, and maybe more rancher candy now? Maybe because of the sweetness. Either way, it's very good. I'm working a white chocolate blue razz cheesecake with this right now, no clue how it will turn out. Thinking blue raspberries & cream too? Need my imagination to kick into gear :(\n","author":"mysticrosell","title":"Blue Raz VG Version","url":"https://redd.it/4rhiy9","vendor":{"name":"Real Flavors","code":"RF"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"RF","title":"Blue Raz VG Version"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
