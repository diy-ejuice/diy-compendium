The tobacco carries some distinctive woodsy tones, and is complimented by a rather syrupy blend of nuts, caramel, molasses, with maybe raisins or prunes, and a slightly smokey note in the deep background.  Kind of reminds me of my days when I chewed fresh Levi Garrett from a pouch.  \n\n**Off-flavors:** Nothing to report here.\n\n**Throat hit:** 6/10 robust, yet pretty smooth\n\n**Uses:** Good as is, but would work in a blended tobacco base too.  Honestly, this flavor is pretty good after a couple days steeping.  I know it's cliche to let tobacco flavors steep a while longer than normal, but I think this one could be easily enjoyed either way, as the raisins and syrup do die down a bit after a while.\n\n**Pairings:**   I can't even imagine pairing this one with much besides other preferred tobaccos.  Maybe something that's already in it that you want to accent like nuts, caramel, maple, raisin?  \n\n**Notes:**  Due to it's complexity, I recommend to definitely try this flavoring alone before deciding what to add to it.  I'm going to bet Inawera intended this flavor to be enjoyed standalone.\n\n**Bonus Recipe**\n\nIngredient | Percentage\n---|---\nINW Gold Ducat | 3-4%\n\n[Link to all of our flavor reviews in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)\n\nEdit: Included steeping notes.","author":"wh1skeyk1ng","title":"Gold Ducat","url":"https://redd.it/5k4i93","vendor":{"name":"Inawera","code":"INW"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"INW","title":"Gold Ducat"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
