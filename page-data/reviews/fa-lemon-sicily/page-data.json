Can be used as a top note as well, and surprisingly good single flavor mix.\n\n**Pairings**\n\n Citrus fruits, berries, creams, tobacco's, bakeries, and vanilla flavoring.\n\n**Rating**\n\n90/100 \n\n**Notes**\n\n>Sicilian Lemons are the best in the world, large, juicy and with a unique citrus tang. The Southern Mediterranean sun and rich Sicilian soil combine to produce a flavour that once tried, is never forgotten. Lemon Sicily lives up to that reputation and is delightfully refreshing to the palate.\n\n*Please if your opinion differs, or you have another review for this post it in the comments.
