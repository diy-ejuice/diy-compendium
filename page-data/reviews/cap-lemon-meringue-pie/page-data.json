Sweet and luscious meringue with hints of caramelized sugar. Fluffy and delicate meringue is a top note here, good body and mouth feel without any egg white flavor. Bakery pie crust notes round out the flavors here. I almost taste a moist shortbread cookie crust? This is actually a fairly authentic lemon meringue pie, and the crust to filling to meringue ratio is balanced well. The lemon itself is mild and missing a hint of tartness or bite, but still holding it's own. However, this has been steeping for 9 weeks and I have a feeling it has faded as usual with lemons.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:** None\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit:** 3/10\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Uses:** Pies, cakes, bakeries, pudding, custards, parfaits. There isn't a lot of uses for this in mixing, it's a pretty complete single flavor on it's own. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Notes:** Good strength for a single flavor around 10%. I'm thinking I will tweak this just slightly and quite happily vape it for an easy single flavor. See recipe below, it boosted the lemon perfectly and added the right touch of tartness.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSimple LMP\n\n 10.00% Lemon Meringue Pie v1 (CAP)   \n 0.50%  Lemon (FE)   \n 0.25% Lime Tahity (Cold Pressed) (FA)   \n\nFlavor total: 10.75%\n\n\nEDIT: Corrected recipe, I had the wrong brand lemon flavor listed.","author":"mysticrosell","title":"Lemon Meringue Pie","url":"https://redd.it/7nf2d6","vendor":{"name":"Capella","code":"CAP"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"CAP","title":"Lemon Meringue Pie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
