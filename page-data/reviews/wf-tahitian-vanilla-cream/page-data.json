Very sweet flavor. It isn't a very dark or spicy vanilla just light and smooth.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Nothing weird going on here tastes exactly how it ought to.\n\n**Throat Hit:** A little stingy on the exhale but goes away after a few puffs.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I will be using this a lot like vanilla swirl, anywhere I want a creamy sweet vanilla added. This will sweeten up any mix and would be really good in custards and bakeries. I can see this pairing very well with caramels/butterscotches, nuts, darker fruits. This would also be a good helper with vbic.\n\n**Notes:** There is nothing special or noteworthy about this flavor, it is just a good sweet plain vanilla, making it a pretty versatile flavor if you have it but not something I would go out of my way to purchase. If your preffered vendor carries it it is worth throwing it in your cart, otherwise you can do without it if you have vanilla swirl or inw vanilla shisha. \n\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"mlNikon","title":"Tahitian Vanilla Cream","url":"https://redd.it/5pk53y","vendor":{"name":"Wonder Flavors","code":"WF"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"WF","title":"Tahitian Vanilla Cream"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
