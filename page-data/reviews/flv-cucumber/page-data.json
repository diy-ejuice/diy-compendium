Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Cucumber @ 1% and 1 drop per 10ml (about .25%), 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 9 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  First, shoutout to /u/Zermacht/, because my review of this is pretty heavily colored by their review of [RF Cucumber.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/65erin/rf_cucumber_bigger_than_yours/)  I get a sweet and slightly dry, peel-heavy version of cucumber with a bit of a salty tinge. Less astringent and green than FA Cucumber, but not nearly as juicy as CAP Cucumber. If you've made tzatziki sauce and done the thing where you salt the cucumber and press it to get some of the water out... this kind of tastes like that.  \n\nInhale is salty and a bit sharp, with a higher realistic cucumber top note. On the lighter side, with a pretty solid and slightly out-of-place sweetness.  Exhale has that same slightly salty cucumber taste up front. Not a really strong flavor, sort of like a grassy honeydew with a bit of salt. Higher peel notes, fairly strong but not overpowering and very realistic tasting. Sweet but lighter mouthfeel.  Sweetness is a bit hard to describe, but it's definitely a greener vegetal sweetness.  That sweetness is, for me at least, a bit offputting at higher percentages. Exhale is fairly clean, but I get some lingering artificial-tasting cucumber flavor.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Good amount of skin on this.  It's definitely cucumber skin, so it's not \"off\"... but it's skin-heavy nonetheless.  Again, hat tip to u/zermacht/, I'm getting some saltiness that seems to up the dryness a bit.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Nah, not really.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Standard cucumber pairings are melons, citrus, and mints. Basically anything \"refreshing.\"\n\nCucumbers add some freshness to brighter flavors like strawberry.\n\nThe vegetal part of this works well to soften up a stronger basil flavor like FLV Basil or FA Zen Garden.\n\nWorks well in cocktail recipes, especially with gin. The relative dryness of this makes CAP Cucumber a better choice if you're mostly after juiciness.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, at .25% this seems a bit too light. Some bright cucumber top notes, but no real body to it.  Some raw VG here. .5% has bit of dryer body and stronger top notes, but still not quite a full cucumber flavor. 1% starts to fill out substantially. Top notes are like freshly sliced cucumber, although the body is a little flat and fairly dry for a cucumber.  1.5% has a sweet green body and pronounced peel notes.  At 2%, the sweetness here doesn't really sit right with me.  The flavor is full but not really crisp, so it gets pretty weird. I'd recommend starting with this at 1% and working up.\n\nSeems like it'll be more useful for the top notes than anything else. Lacking some of the juicier cucumber body that I want.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nNah, not really.\n\n[Heres the Flavorah product page.  Their description: \"A fresh and innovative flavor profile that vapes like a happy hours cocktail. Don’t bother turning up your pinky finger when you burn this…it’s not a light airy essence, it’s a good fresh and full hitting vegetal vape. Delightful with a cooling menthol, or can be happily blended with some fruits for a very condescending and upscale juice from the top shelf. Capital!\"  Apparently this turns you into a bit of a dick, so caveat emptor.](http://store.flavorah.com/concentrated-cucumber-flavor)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Cucumber","url":"https://redd.it/65ntjm","vendor":{"name":"Flavorah","code":"FLV"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FLV","title":"Cucumber"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
