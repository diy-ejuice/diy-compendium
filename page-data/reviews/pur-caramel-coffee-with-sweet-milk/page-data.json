Creamy sweet cream with caramel syrup stirred in. Very good as is, can also see it becoming a great frappe with a little added heavy creams or ice creams with a bit more caramel and some vanilla. This has steeped into a very well balanced frappe. The cream has become more noticeable, and stands up with the coffee better now. The coffee is still robust without being bitter or acidic, and it's all blended together with a sweet caramel syrup. Not caramel candy and not artificial. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:** None\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit:** 2/10\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Pairings:**  Cookies, cakes, creams, custards, nuts, tobaccos. Nuts, additional caramel or butterscotch, pralines, butter pecan.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Notes:** I am really impressed with this one. Good strength at 6% for a single flavor. Very much tastes like a Caramel Frappuccino from you know who. Without ice. Some Koolada and it will be a great single flavor. This can be easily customized to different tastes. Additional cream, or ice cream or whipped cream, or vanillas, or caramel, cinnamon? Although good at the first 7 days, the cream really comes out to play at 4 weeks.\n","author":"mysticrosell","title":"Caramel Coffee with Sweet Milk","url":"https://redd.it/6dkmf3","vendor":{"name":"Purilum","code":"PUR"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"PUR","title":"Caramel Coffee with Sweet Milk"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
