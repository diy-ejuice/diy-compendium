It's slightly tangy and slightly sweet cream cheese filling. The almond comes through on the top as well, and the bread is very light and only found on the exhale. It actually has a full bodied mouth feel. The bready aspect does taste very similar to a danish. Not quite strong enough at this point. Definitely unbalanced, both the cheese filling and almonds are very forward, with the danish very light. It could still change with a longer steep. I have a feeling it might be a little better at a higher percentage. It's a pretty complete flavoring, so I am going to try in the 9-12% range and see if the danish come out to play. The flavors have become more balanced with the longer steep. I don't think the danish flavor strengthened, rather the cream cheese and almonds seemed to settle into the danish. The danish has developed a little more butter and  baked flavor, and the cheese filling is very accurate.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:** None\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit:** 1/10\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Pairings:** Almost any fruit will turn this into a fruit or fruit and cream cheese danish. Cookie, cinnamon roll, doughnuts, cakes, creams, nuts, coffee, marshmallow, meringue, icing.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Notes:** Overall it's a very good and complete flavor, albeit weak for my personal tastes at the 6%. I liked it much better at 9%. For sure it's more of a one shot flavor, adding accents to it will be much easier than using it as an accent flavor.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**EDIT:** removed avoid citrus as someone so kindly pointed out my failure of logic :-). Lemon would be fantastic with this, credit to lolwtf. Probably orange and lime as well. I do want to say avoid grapefruit instead....yuck!","author":"mysticrosell","title":"Cream Cheese Danish with Toasted Almonds","url":"https://redd.it/6dkmwu","vendor":{"name":"Purilum","code":"PUR"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"PUR","title":"Cream Cheese Danish with Toasted Almonds"}},
