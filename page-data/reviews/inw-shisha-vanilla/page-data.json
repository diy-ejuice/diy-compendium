This is a very creamy, light vanilla with a nice sweetness about it. When I say light I don't mean light in flavor, but light in profile, as opposed to dark. You definitely get some nice vanilla, but it's not quite as dark of a vanilla as say FA Bourbon Vanilla or McCormick's Vanilla Extract (lul). This flavoring adds some decent creamy body, smoothness, and a touch of vanilla sweetness to a mix. IDK about you but that's exactly the kind of thing I want to bring to a cream party.\n\n**On the Nose**  \nA creamy sweet vanilla. Reminiscent of CAP's VCv1, but not quite as heavy.\n\n**Recommended Usage**  \n*Stand alone*: 3%\n\n*In a mix*: 0.5-2%\n\n**Throat**  \nMild\n\n**Pairings**  \nCreams, berries, marshmallow, tobacco, coffee, caramel, butterscotch\n\n**Avoid**  \nI wouldn't say to avoid anything necessarily, but may mute or distract from brighter fruits & citruses.\n\n**Steep**  \n2-3 days\n\n**Simple Recipe: Shisha Strawberry Cream**  \n*Ratio: 15PG/85VG* \n*Steep: 2 days* \n\n* INW Shisha Strawberry @ 4%  \n* INW Shisha Vanilla @ 3%  \n\nI mixed this up on a whim just because they were my two favorite ingredients at the time, and wanted to see how a \"Mustard Milk\" play on them would work. While not as successful as Mustard Milk, it is an enjoyable vape and really lets these two shisha flavorings shine, and gives you a great idea of what both of them bring to the table.  \n\n**Complex Recipe: Sweet Strawberry Cream**  \n*Ratio: 15PG/85VG* \n*Steep: 3+ days* \n\n* TFA Strawberry Ripe @ 3%  \n* FA Red Touch @ 0.5%  \n* INW Shisha Strawberry @ 2%  \n* TFA Vanilla Bean Ice Cream @ 3%  \n* INW Shisha Vanilla @ 1%  \n* LA Cream Cheese Icing @ 1%  \n* FLV Cream @ 1%  \n\nINW Shisha Vanilla is just an accent here, but is vital to the mix. It really helps to sort of tone the creams and bring them together, lend some creaminess, and add a touch of vanilla","author":"CheebaSteeba","title":"Shisha Vanilla","url":"https://redd.it/4q2cqx","vendor":{"name":"Inawera","code":"INW"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"INW","title":"Shisha Vanilla"}},
