IMO this is more like smoking a virginia/burley mix than most virginia and burley flavorings offer. \n\nOff-flavors: none\n\nthroat hit: none\n\nuses and pairings: Other pipe tobaccos. You could probably pull a cigarette out with this one if you put in some ash notes and some more astringent tobaccos, but this is a pipe tobacco imo. \n\nsecond opinions: none i could find on here.","author":"[deleted]","title":"555 Gold","url":"https://redd.it/6mifi9","vendor":{"name":"Inawera","code":"INW"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"INW","title":"555 Gold"}},
