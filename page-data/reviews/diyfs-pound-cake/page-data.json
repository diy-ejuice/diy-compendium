This is a flavour that should be in every cake lovers arsenal! \n\n**Setup**\n\nRDA | Hastur RDA 2S by Cthulhu Mod | Dual 6 wrap triple-twisted SS coils | 0.25 Ω | 40 watts | Japanese organic cotton   \n\n**Testing** \n\nSteep Time: None / 1 week | Used: 2% | 70/30 VG/PG | Nic: 0% \n\n**Throat Hit**\n\nNone; 0/10\n\n**Smell** \n\nThis is one of the best smelling bakery flavourings I have ever smelled. On first whiff, I get a very sweet vanilla, which smells simply divine! It smells like icing on a cake. On second whiff, I get what sugar, butter, and egg yolks mixed together smells like. No yeast or baked notes. Trying to describe the smell made me realize that I am smelling cake batter. Unbaked sweet deliciousness!\n\n**Flavour Description**\n\nSomething that smells this great must also taste great, right? At least that’s what I was hoping for and guess what, it does! Rich, sweet, cakey, and full of flavour. It tastes just like a fluffy moist vanilla cake with frosting. I want to pour this flavouring into a cake pan and bake it, that’s how good it is. It is everything that I want in a cake flavouring. The vanilla they use is unreal and is similar to Holy Vanilla but different. Overall this is my flavourite cake flavouring to date. Although, this may just be me, but I feel it leans slightly towards cake batter than baked cake. A darker caramelic note may help with the baked note or even a drop or two of Acetyl Pyrazine. At 2% this flavour is very strong and I would even suggest 1.5% as a standalone. \n\n**Off Flavours**\n\nNon-what so ever. Very clean and very accurate yellow cake. \n\n**Uses**\n\nAny recipe that you want a sweet, moist, fluffy, vanilla cake. Very strong flavour, so I suggest starting off low, 0.5% in a mix, and work your way up to 1.5%. I enjoy this flavour as a standalone but have mixed it with common bakery flavourings and it does blend nicely. \n\n**Notes** \n\nInitially I did a taste test sample before shake and vaping… and I went back for a second… and a third. This stuff is heavenly! I did eventually get around to vaping it and it boy oh boy was full of flavour, even when fresh! I don’t think this flavour needs a long steep, it is good right away but best after 3-7 days.\n\n**Rating**\n\nA+ for its potency, accuracy and overall deliciousness!\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Recipes** \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Vanilla Custard**\n\nMFG | Flavour | %\n:--|:--:|--:\nCAP | Vanilla Custard | 10\nDIYFS | Pound Cake | 0.5\nDIYFS | Holy Vanilla | 1.5\nCAP | Sugar Cookie | 2.5\n\n*Steep Time:* 4-6 weeks but if you like fresh custards this one is great after a week and only gets better.\n\nThis is slowly becoming my favourite vanilla custard. The presence of the sweet, rich, and moist pound cake really compliments the custard. The profile is a rich vanilla custard layered on cake. The sugar cookie helps boost the baked note but ever so slightly, while holy vanilla adds more depth to the vanilla profile.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Peach Cake**\n\nMFG | Flavour | %\n:--|:--:|--:\nINW | Peach | 1.5\nFA | White Peach | 1\nDIYFS | Pound Cake | 1.5\nTPA| Strawberry Ripe | 3\n\n*Steep Time:* 1+ week\n\nBoth peaches combine to create a sweet peach profile layered on a moist vanilla cake. The strawberry ripe adds sweetness and because I can't taste strawberries it does not change the peach profile but merely pushes the peach forward. Simple but delicious. \n","author":"ohm-society","title":"Pound Cake","url":"https://redd.it/5x0wkc","vendor":{"name":"DIY Flavor Shack","code":"DIYFS"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"DIYFS","title":"Pound Cake"}},
