{"componentChunkName":"component---src-components-review-js","path":"/reviews/rf-pineapple-sc","result":{"data":{"reviewsJson":{"markdown":"**Setup**: velocity v2; dual 24g SS316 7 wrap; full cotton wicks\n\n**Testing**: Pineapple (super concentrate) 2% aged: 3 days 60/40 vg/pg 1mg nic\n\n**Flavor description** Fresh cut pineapple. This has got it all, I am getting a little of the pineapple flesh along with that tartness you get on the tongue before the sweet juice hits you after you bite down. Really surprised how accurate this flavor is, if you like pineapple I have to recommend trying this. \n\n**Off-flavors**: Nada\n\n**Throat hit**: Nope.\n\n**Uses**: Wow, just use it everywhere. You could probably take this in any direction. Add some bourbon or liquid amber and you got a baked pineapple.\nAdd some rum and coconut candy and you got a pina colada. Throw some fruits at it and youâ€™ve got a tropical mix of your own. \n\n**Pairings**: (from flavor bible) Banana, caramel, cardamom, chocolate, cinnamon, coconut, cream/ice cream, tropical fruits, ginger, grapefruit, honey, kiwi, lemon, lime, nuts, (macadamia, cashew, pistachio), maple, mint, orange, papaya, passion fruit, pomegranate, raspberry, rum\n\n**Notes**: Absolutely delicious, IMO better standalone pineapple compared to INW and CAP golden. At 1% the flavor was a bit weak, mostly pineapple top notes. The fruit fills out at 1.5-2% with the fleshy parts and juiciness. More fruity and fleshy than INW and less weirdness/canned pineapple taste than CAP.\n\n**Second Opinions**\nReally nothing useful out there. Hope someone else who has tried it chimes in.\n","author":"HashSlingingSlashur","title":"Pineapple SC","url":"https://redd.it/60wybv","vendor":{"name":"Real Flavors","code":"RF"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"RF","title":"Pineapple SC"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
