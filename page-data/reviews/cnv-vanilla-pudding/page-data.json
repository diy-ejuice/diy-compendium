A steep does help and I recommend 4-6 days to let it come together. Its rich, creamy and very full, it really coats the tongue, The Vanilla isn't dark or overtly bright, but works well with a lot of things because of that. Wouldn't say that it has any butter of any kind\n\nOff-notes: When I crank this up past 5% it gets lost and has slight almost wax notes, imagine you bit into those soft wax bottle candies from when you were a kid, you don't taste it but the mouthfeel is there, its kinda off-putting \n\nThroat Hit: Not at all, very smooth. 2/10 if that.\n\nPairings: Man this stuff can go with a lot, pairs well with other vanillas, custards, puddings, and really goes well with fruits. This is like a base note for me and a really good one at that, i find that a little bit of WF Vanilla Cream Extra really supports it and INW Custard goes with it as well, This is a pretty fun flavor imo.\n\nSecond opinion from the legless wheel augmented u/wolfwheeler is \"It’s better than FLV. It’s sweet, bright vanilla, and really has that snack pack flavor that everyone wants from a pudding.\"\nWould recommend it in a mix at 1.5-3%","author":"Elemntion","title":"Vanilla Pudding","url":"https://redd.it/lci0zf","vendor":{"name":"Chemnovatic","code":"CNV"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"CNV","title":"Vanilla Pudding"}},
