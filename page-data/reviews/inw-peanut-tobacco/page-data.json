I don't really detect any Acetyl Pyrazine. It's calmed down quite a bit since I first mixed it. The raw peanut taste, while still there, has let a subtle sweetness come through a bit more. To be honest, I preferred it more around 2 weeks old. I have used, and will probably continue to only use this as an accent. It finds its way to the front of a mix pretty easily, so I suggest starting low. I had to back off from 1% down to .5% in one mix because it was all I could taste. So maybe start at .5% and go up from there. \n\n\n**Recommended Pairings**\n\nTobaccos. I've got this in a Burley NET and it's probably my favorite juice right now. Artificial Burley, I'm not too sure about. Maybe FLV Red Burley, but I haven't tried that yet. Should work well with any earthy tobacco though. Probably work in a 555 or RY4 type of mix as well, but it's not going to be your typical sweet dessert type. \n\nOther nuts\n\nAnywhere a peanut would fit. Maybe a sundae recipe? I tried it, but I can't really stand vanilla anymore, so I didn't like it. \n\nWood/earthy flavors. I use it with FA Oakwood in that Burley NET. Nice combo. \n\n**Off Notes**\n\nI'd say that the sweetness I'm starting to get from it this far in to the steep is an off note, but it's not really bad. I just really liked it when it didn't have any sweetness. \n\n**Notes**\n\nIt's called Peanut Tobacco, but I don't really get the Tobacco part. I think it's a good friend to tobaccos, but you'll need to add a Tobacco to the mix. Although maybe that creeping sweetness could possibly taste like a sweet Virginia or Flue Cured, I still wouldn't rely on it to carry the tobacco note. It's more peanut than anything.
