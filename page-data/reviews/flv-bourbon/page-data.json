{"componentChunkName":"component---src-components-review-js","path":"/reviews/flv-bourbon","result":{"data":{"reviewsJson":{"markdown":"**Setup:** Velocity 2 Clone, Dual 15 wrap 3mm Nifethal 70 coils @.18 ohms.  45W power, 480F temp limit. Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Bourbon @ 3%, 70/30 VG/PG, Steeped 2 weeks.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Charred oak and sweetness.  In that order. The star of the show is that bold smoky, charred oak flavor on the inhale and the beginning of the exhale.  Exhale ends with a relatively thin but suprisingly accurate sweet blended whiskey note.\n\n**Off-flavors:** None.\n\n**Throat Hit:** 7/10, but that's kind of the point, right? An assertive charred oak taste is going to be a bit aggressive.\n\n**Uses:**  A strong initial bourbon note, which carries really well into mixes.  It manages to stay prominent and identifiable even with competing concentrates thrown into a mix.  Great for cocktails and tobacco mixes.  It's probably not great for bakeries where you'd add something like TFA Kentucky Bourbon for warmth.\n\n**Pairings:**  Dark or jammy fruit like apples or blueberries, dark chocolate, citrus, tobacco, vanilla, butterscotch, caramel. \n\n**Notes:**  This is fantastic.  If TFA Kentucky Bourbon is the melted ice from a 7&7, and FA Whisky is that actual 7&7, then this is worlds ahead in evoking actual whiskey.  That rich and robust charred oak sits right up in front, and holds on after a steep.  The actual body of the whiskey is thin and sweet, but I'll be using this primarily for that opening note.  Again, fantastic for people that are looking for some of the soul of a decent bourbon.","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Bourbon","url":"https://redd.it/5axz0t","vendor":{"name":"Flavorah","code":"FLV"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FLV","title":"Bourbon"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
