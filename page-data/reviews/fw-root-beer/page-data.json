I don't see it coming into handy as an accent, or background note, but really haven't tried playing with the flavoring at low percentages.\n\n**Off Flavors**\n\nThe flavoring is strong and can be overpowering, and I know this is not a off Note but it definitely needs a little vanilla to balance it out.\n\n**Pairings** \n\nOther Cola flavorings, vanilla, creams, ice creams, and I could see it working with a few very sweet fruits, like apple or pear, may also work well with tobacco, and spice flavorings such as cardamon.\n\n**Recipe** \n\nRecipe was an attempt at root beer float that turned into something else. I have been enjoying this recipe lately and don't feel like it needs to be changed, but would love any suggestions on how to get to the root beer float from here.\n\n https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/10951\n\n**Notes** \n\nAs almost always there is a Wikipedia on root beer if you are interested and learning about this flavor.\n\n https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_beer\n\n**Rating** 90/100\n\n**Please if your opinion differs, or you have another review for this flavor add it in the comments. This will help the master list with multiple reviews in one spot.**","author":"Chrisdvr1","title":"Root Beer","url":"https://redd.it/52g71s","vendor":{"name":"Flavor West","code":"FW"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FW","title":"Root Beer"}},
