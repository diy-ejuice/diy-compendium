Creamy with a hint of vanilla and that fantastic Sweet Bitter cocoa butter flavor.\n\n**Off Flavors** -  a very slight chalky flavor and aftertaste.       \n\n**Position in the recipe** - should be versatile depending on what your pairing with. Doesn't have the punch to be a top note unless you're mixing it who did nothing but cream. Should make a great accent and work well in the base.\n\n**Pairings** - other chocolates and creams    should work well. The whole list of berries and should pair well with most bakeries, and caramel flavorings.","author":"Chrisdvr1","title":"White Chocolate","url":"https://redd.it/4ll7l2","vendor":{"name":"Flavor West","code":"FW"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FW","title":"White Chocolate"}},
