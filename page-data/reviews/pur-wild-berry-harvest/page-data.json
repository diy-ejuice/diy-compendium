Sweet. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Flavor Description:** Strawberry and blackberry hit first. Raspberry marionberry, and boysenberry? Not detecting any blueberry, but almost a red huckleberry faintly? Tastes like a blend of fresh and artificial fruit. At 4 weeks this has transformed into a very naturally sweet mix of berries. Refreshing and juicy seeded berries, and I no longer get any artificial flavors. Strawberry, raspberry, and blackberry seem the most obvious. A hint of blueberry in the back. I'm sure there are more, but I can't pick them out individually. These do have a  slightly more vibrant and brighter flavor than other mixed berries I have tried. Maybe that is the wild part?\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:** None\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit:** 2/10\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Pairings:** Almost any fruit, apples, grapes, cranberries. Cakes scones, biscuits. cobblers, cereal, creams, custards, nuts, tobaccos, fruit drinks, candy, gummy candy. Doughnut , pastries.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Notes:** This is a good strength for a single flavor in an RDA. If using a tank I would recommend 8-10%. As an accent flavor maybe 1.5-3% I am already working on a yummy Wild Berry shortcake with a big mound of whipped cream.","author":"mysticrosell","title":"Wild Berry Harvest","url":"https://redd.it/6dkqy6","vendor":{"name":"Purilum","code":"PUR"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"PUR","title":"Wild Berry Harvest"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
