Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Soursop @ 3%, 70/30 VG/PG, Steeped 12 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** I get a slightly sour apple and coconut taste.  Apple up front, and them a slightly sour coconut on the backend.  Coconut flavor is fairly smooth and creamy, while the apple is relatively dull and sweet.  Quite a bit more going on in the background.  I'm getting a very occasional zippy pineapple and a fairly realistic cherry / maybe strawberry note.  Banana notes show in up some of the coconut. \n\n**Off-flavors:** None.  Lots of different fruit, but I can't call any of it unpleasant.\n\n**Throat Hit:** 3/10. Smooth, especially for anything that has a sour note.\n\n**Uses:**  A very busy concentrate.  Single Flavor? Accent flavor for an apple or coconut forward juice.  Would probably work really well as a mixed fruit smoothie, just like guanabana. Tropical juices.\n\n**Pairings:** Tropical flavors. Pineapple. Banana. Cherry. Apple. Creamy coconut. Just straight creams for something like a pina colada. Has a robust full fruity sweetness that should go well with candy concentrates like Taffy, Gummies, Jelly Candy, or Hard Candy.\n\n**Notes:**  This was hard. I don't have any experience with soursop as an actual food item. I picked it up because it was new from flavorah and I'm a fan of cherimoya from Inawera.  Google says that soursop and guanabana are different names for the same fruit, which is closely related to cherimoya. INW Cherimoya gives me a pretty clear creamy and an overripe apple. This has some of the same character, but with a heavy coconut inflection on a duller apple note.  It's get harder to describe what else is happening here.  It tastes... tropical. But a realistic tropical instead of a scented candle tropical. Life can't all be mai tais and all inclusive resorts. This is a tiny bit sour, a little sweaty but still delicious.  I really like this, I'm just kind of at a loss for words.  I'm hoping anyone else with this flavor and some experience can weigh in.\n\nThe even harder part is to compare this to FLV Guanabana. After all, they are apparently different names for the same thing. Vaping Guanabana, it seems to have a less pronounced sour note. A lot of the same flavors seem to be in play. I get a muted pineapple and a much stronger banana than coconut.  It's a ripe, realistic, soft banana note though.  It's also feels a touch thicker.
