Fruit loops.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Flavor Description:** I'm getting a prominent oat/grain cereal with sweetened mixed artificial fruit. Apple seems dominant to me, with a hint of lemon? Tastes like apple jacks rather than fruit loops. The fruit is artificial, nothing fresh.\n\nAt 4 weeks the oat flavor has smoothed out a bit and moved into grain cereal, no hints of Cheerios left. I am still getting closer to the apple jacks than fruit loops side. If I really look for it I can find a very tiny hint of lemon. It's a very good cereal, you can almost feel the crunch, the fruit is moderately strong but still doesn't bury the cereal. It's a very authentic artificially fruit flavored sweetened cereal. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:** None\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit:** 3/10\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Pairings:** Milk or cream. Maybe a little butter and lot of marshmallow for a cereal treat.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Notes:** Pretty good strength at 4%, possibly try it up to 6% and that may turn it more towards fruit loops. Personally I love Apple Jacks so I'm liking this a lot. I would say this is a bowl with 45% green rings, 45% orange rings, and 10% yellow rings...lol\n\n&nbsp;\n\nEDIT: Fixed my duplicate copy...cause I'm not always the sharpest crayon in the box ;)","author":"mysticrosell","title":"Fruit Circles","url":"https://redd.it/66ncuj","vendor":{"name":"Purilum","code":"PUR"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"PUR","title":"Fruit Circles"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
