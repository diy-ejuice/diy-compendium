Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Flavor Revolution Honeydew Melon, 1,3 and 5%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 18 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  A very concentrated top-heavy honeydew with some heavy grassy, chemical notes.\n\nThere's definitely some honeydew in here, somewhere.  The honeydew I can taste at lower percentages is on the candied side, with a heavy, flat sweetness.  There is a bit of a creaminess to it, with almost a vanilla edge.  It has a fuller saturated middle without a really fuller, heavier base.  Nothing that really comes across as juicy or realistic.\n\nThere's a really heavy grassy top note here that doesn't really gel entirely with that flatter sweeter base.  Instead of tasting like a realistic honeydew top note, it more just goes candy honeydew and then grass with nothing really bridging the two.  That grassy note gets chemical and bitter really quickly.\n\nThis overall comes across as a bit dry.  There's a candy sweetness, but it's not overwhelming at the sub 1% where the grassy notes aren't as big of an issue.  Its a thinner flavor, without a base.  The honeydew in here tails off substantially on the exhale, but that grassiness sticks around.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Heavy, bitter grassy note that gets chemical.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Fairly light at the lower percentages required to duck most of those grassy notes, but it's pretty harsh at 1% or above.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  1% here is actually coming on pretty strong.  There is some bright candied and slightly creamy honeydew flavor, but it's pretty buried by a bitter and chemical tasting grassy flavor.  Top heavy, with no real base to it.\n\n3% is more worse.  Intense bitter grassy notes, but that sweetness is starting to kick in harder.  Strange.\n\n5% is sweet grass and dish soap.  Don't vape this at 5%.\n\nThis seems substantially stronger than at least the Flavor Revolution Raspberry, Pineapple, and Honey.  That honeydew shows up quickly and manages to be pretty blown out by 1%, although it still doesn't have much of a thicker juicier base.  Just as a S&V at .25% using some of the steeped base from the other samples,  It does cut down on the grassy notes, but the flavor feels even pretty thin and insubstantial.  .5% has a noticeably stronger grassy note that's coming in quicker than the honeydew flavor.  Just based on these tests, I'd go low with this one as an accent.  I'd probably be at .2-.3% with it.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I'm still woefully behind on my honeydew testing, so I don't have much useful info to compare, but this soapier than TPA Honeydew, and much grassier than the CAP version.  It's less full than either.\n\nI didn't find much of a thicker, fuller flavor to this before it was just blown out by that grassy flavor.  I'd use it as a honeydew accent in melon or just general fruit mixes at the aforementioned low percentage of .2-.3%.  I'm not sure you'll get a full honeydew out of it, but at least it's concentrated?\n\n**Second Opinions:** Nah, not really.\n\nAFAIK, these are only available through Nicotine River.  [The product page is here.](https://www.nicotineriver.com/products/flavor-revolution-honeydew-melon)  Not much info besides a description: \"As if it were cut off the vine. A perfectly tasty Honeydew Melon with ripe, natural tasting notes. An excellent addition when used with other Melons as well! Suggested starting percentage: 2% and adjust to taste.\"\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Honeydew Melon","url":"https://redd.it/7jqna5","vendor":{"name":"Flavor Revolution","code":"FR"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FR","title":"Honeydew Melon"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
