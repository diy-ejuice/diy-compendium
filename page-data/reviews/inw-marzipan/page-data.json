Though I must say vaping it standalone is pretty damn good, so maybe it could be the star of a recipe.\n\n**Pairings**- Milks, Cereals, Nuts especially Almond, Cookies, custards, creams.\n\n**Notes**- Very delicious. I think this could be used to elevate cereal flavors that don't quite seem to hit the mark on the milk. This flavor in combinations with cream bases really helps pull together a convincing \"milk\" profile. I never understood why FW Hazelnut was always added to cereal flavorings, I thought it imparted a strange taste that took the vape away from a convincing milk profile. Try INW Marzipan in cereal or milky recipes instead.\n\nIn addition, I think this flavor in combination with FA Almond is just divine. If needing a very nice almond note in a recipe, say for an almond cookie try the combo.","author":"InfinityFractal","title":"Marzipan","url":"https://redd.it/4p38iy","vendor":{"name":"Inawera","code":"INW"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"INW","title":"Marzipan"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
