Inhale you get sweet brown sugar and caramel. Exhale is creamy with notes of vanilla and tobacco (more vanilla though). This is really delicious, will need more help if you’re looking for tobacco though. Overall very balanced and sweet caramel and not too ‘dark’ tasting.\n\n**Off-flavors**: Nothing really.\n\n**Throat Hit**: smooth af, almost nothing\n\n**Uses**: All types of shit. This one is not super strong, I can see this working at 3-5% to add caramel and creaminess to a mix. At 8-12% this is a great standalone and I think this is the same range I’d work with for this one as an RY4 base for a recipe.  \nPairings: Creams and custards, bakeries, some fruits like banana and apple/pear + some others, nuts, tobaccos, candies, should pair well with other caramels and butterscotch type flavors, candies and some spirits. Vanilla and some spices may work too.\n\n**Notes** thoroughly enjoying the tester bottle and it was difficult for me to let this one steep because it is good immediately but gets really nice after about 2 weeks. Going to be mixing a 30ml at 10% and letting that one sit for a month. This is a great flavor for beginners; at 8-12% (depending on your setup/taste) it’s basically a one shot concentrate, and as you order other flavorings you can use this to mix with other stuff. \n\nThis concentrate is clear and has not changed much in color over 2+ weeks\n\n**Second Opinions**\nGreat reviews on [DIYFS site](https://www.diyflavorshack.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=HOLY-GRAIL-RY4-Flavoring-DIY)\n\nCouple of recipes using this on ELR, [one from 2016](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/recipe/816492/Hooper%27s%20Everyday%20Puff) involves 12% toasted marshmallow 4% holy grail, another from 2014 is just 20% holy grail. \n\n[One nice looking recipe](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/24962#cardinal_by_fear) by Fear on ATF, he uses it at 7% and adds some tobaccos to make it more manly.\n\n\n","author":"HashSlingingSlashur","title":"Holy Holy Grail RY4","url":"https://redd.it/5rxh3x","vendor":{"name":"DIY Flavor Shack","code":"DIYFS"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"DIYFS","title":"Holy Holy Grail RY4"}},
