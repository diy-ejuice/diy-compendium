It's like someone took bran flakes, mixed them with ground nuts, and coated it all with a honey glaze.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Nothing really off vs what the name suggests.\n\n**Throat hit:** 3/10, pretty smooth but has a noticeable threshold where you do feel a little something after a decent draw.\n\n**Uses:** 1-2% will add a sweet, honey-like, and subtle crunchy/nutty note to your bakery recipe,  3-6%+ makes it noticeably crunchy and grainy base for a cereal recipe, but will also bring some nuttiness to the party.\n\n**Pairings:**   Dairy, berry fruits, biscuit, cookie, cake, nuts, brown sugar, maybe even a tobacco recipe that needs a sweet note.\n\n**Notes:** This flavor lacks enough depth to be a standalone for me, however @ 4% it is a nice sweet, nutty, and slightly crunchy vape.  I'm not able to taste any slight berry notes suggested by other tasters.\n\nFlavor available at BCV [here](http://www.bullcityflavors.com/cereal-27-cap/) CAP Cereal 27\n\n[Prior review of CAP Cereal 27](https://redd.it/4mp3mr)  \n\n[Link to e-liquid-recipes notes on this flavor](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/92743)\n\n[Link to all of our flavor reviews in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)","author":"wh1skeyk1ng","title":"Cereal 27","url":"https://redd.it/5plwxg","vendor":{"name":"Capella","code":"CAP"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"CAP","title":"Cereal 27"}},
