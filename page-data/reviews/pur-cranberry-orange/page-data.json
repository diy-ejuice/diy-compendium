Bitterness.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Flavor Description:** I didn't try this until the 4 week steep, so I'm not sure how it is as a S&V. At 4 weeks. Tart fresh cranberries is the first thing you taste,  following that is a sweet blood orange juice and I'm tasting a bit of zest as well. Although the orange isn't as dominant as the cranberries, it's balanced just enough to be a noticable presence. If you have ever tasted that cranberry orange zest relish so popular around the holidays, this is it. In a vape. A very complete flavor.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:** None\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit:** 3/10\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Pairings:** I'm drawing a blank here. Other citrus? Orange, lemonade, lime. Nuts.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Notes:** This is a good strength at 6% for a single flavor. If you like tart, citrus, or the relish you will love this.\n","author":"mysticrosell","title":"Cranberry Orange","url":"https://redd.it/6dkmmz","vendor":{"name":"Purilum","code":"PUR"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"PUR","title":"Cranberry Orange"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
