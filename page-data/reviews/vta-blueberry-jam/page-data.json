Aftertaste was like a blueberry powder candy like a pixie stick. After it steeped for 2 weeks I tried vaping it. It taste a lot like VT Strawberry Jam. Like a blueberry hard candy with a chewy center. I also really coats the tongue like the aforementioned VT Strawberry Jam. Has a thick and smooth mouthfeel. It is a decent enough blueberry that I could see using it in recipes. It is just not a authentic blueberry to me. It does have some jelly/jam like quailties in the mouthfeel. \n\n**Pairings:** This would go well in candy mixes, creams, other fruits.
