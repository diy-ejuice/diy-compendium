Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Coffee @ 1% and 1 drop per 10ml, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 11 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Dark roasted coffee with a lot of dark cocoa and some coconut. Heavy vape, with a creamy mouthfeel under the higher, darkly roasted bitter notes.  Sub 1%, manages to avoid most of the burnt, buttery notes that turn people off coffee.. but there isn't a ton of identifiable straight coffee here, so it's a bit of mixed bag.  Tastes like a cleaner, more darkly roasted version of INW Mocca.  Definitely on the strong side, should put itself front and center damn near anywhere you try to put it.\n\nInhale has a lot of cocoa. Darkly roasted, with a kind of pleasant bitter, really slightly burnt note in the top notes.  Dense, with a heavier, creamy mouthfeel and a not overwhelming sweetness.  Exhale has black coffee right up front, with dark chocolate following close behind. Again, darkly roasted but not quite at that buttery, burnt level as some other coffees.  More like a really high cocoa percentage dark chocolate than a more authentic dark espresso roast. Creamy base, with a pretty distinct coconut kind of taste especially towards the very tail end of the exhale. Sweetness has a bit of weird fruityness at .5%, but I don't really pick it up at .25 or 1%.  Lingering dark chocolate bitterness and slight burnt note with some fatty coconut cream kind of taste.\n \n**Off-flavors:**  I'm getting a lot of cocoa and coconut out of this.  Coffee itself can have a bunch of varying flavor profiles, so it isn't necessarily off but it's a bit different than I'd expect from a straight coffee concentrate.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Light. Nothing major or especially sharp.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:** Sweeter coffee vapes.  It's 75% of the way there solo at .5%. Creamy texture, if not a real distinct cream taste so something like FW Hazelnut and sweeter cream of choice would get you in the ballpark.\n\nSeems like a good coffee for bakeries with a coffee component. Cocoa and coconut here would work well with a grainier base and extra sweetness.\n\nThe deleted user from the second opinions brings up cocktail vapes, and this would probably do a good job standing in for kahlua.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, at .25% this is resoundingly okay.  Almost a hot chocolate inhale, with a bit of black coffee and a softer coconut smoothness to exhale. .5% has a bit more aggressive coffee note, but still coming across as mostly cocoa on the inhale with a bit of raisin-y sweetness.  The exhale has dark chocolate, coffee, and coconut in there.  Still no real burnt note to the coffee flavor. 1% is pretty intense. I'm getting a bit of a burnt note on the inhale and a whole lot of it on the exhale. Not quite the buttery burnt of FA Dark Bean yet, but it's a really, really dark roast.  Coconut is getting a bit fatty and weird as well. I'd recommend using this at .25% as an accent, and maybe .75% as a main note. People seem have to a varying sensitivity for these kind of flavors, so maybe start lower than you'd think and work up.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[The deleted user strikes again: \"Coconut and caramel up front followed by very clean coffee flavor. Sweet and slightly bitter with some sort of neutral front-of-the-tongue (grapey) fruitiness (ethyl acetate?) Vapes a little coffee “liqueur-esque” (alcohol?) but the coffee flavor is clean and free of unwanted off-notes. Nice little hint of organic earthiness in the exhale. Cocktail time! Add coffee backbone to cloying mixes. Try in place of coconut. Might be interesting in tobaccos. Caution using with additional coconut. May amplify fruit flavors a bit in mixes. Try @ 1% to start.\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/30arnc/my_flv_tasting_notes_coffee/)\n\n[U/trancinate/ 's take on a post griping about coffee flavors: \"FLV Coffee is spot-on perfect black coffee. Stupid strong, too. 1% is fine IMO for standalone, or even with a small amount of cream or caramel or hazelnut or whatever. I added .2% to a RY4 mix once and i seriously tasted mostly coffee with a very background note of \"grandma's purse & caramel.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/43v73j/the_coffee_dilemma/)\n\n[Heres the Flavorah product page.  Their description: \"We're from Seattle, so this flavor is taken very seriously, and often with a little bit of mint! A rich coffee flavor that has a dark, burned cocoa zip. Unlike other coffee flavors that are bitter and espresso bean-like, this coffee is rich and smokey. Good for adding a complex and rich background, or as a featured vape flavoring.\"  I'm from the Seattle-ish area too, and I have to say, GTFO with your mint.](http://store.flavorah.com/concentrated-coffee-flavor)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Coffee","url":"https://redd.it/66m0o0","vendor":{"name":"Flavorah","code":"FLV"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FLV","title":"Coffee"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
