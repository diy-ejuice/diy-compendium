The only profile missing is that slight tang a pineapple has, otherwise it is fairly realistic. Unfortunately (or fortunately, depending on what you're going for I guess) this is not the profile that sticks around. After an overnight steep it changes into a pineapple juice, like someone took that realistic pineapple and squeezed the juice out of it till all that was left of it was the lifeless, shriveled husk of possibility and a glass of pineapple juice. After a further steep it loses more of its bright and juicy aspects and fades into a sweet candied pineapple, either a literal pineapple candy or a dry pineapple covered in some sugar; it is NOT a particularly bright, juicy, tangy/sharp, realistic pineapple. \n\n**Off-flavors:** None at around 6%, I could imagine some weird sharp or almost sickly sweet if its pushed too high though. Edit: As many people have mentioned in the comments, some get an almost 'battery-acid' like note if used at too high a percent. This battery acid note can also make the vape very harsh.\n\n**Throat hit:** None, 0/10 - it is smooth and has a similar 'wet' effect as INW Cactus. \n\n**Uses:** Despite my ragging on it, I do think this flavor is usable both as a standalone and in a mix. As a standalone it can be used for a sweet, almost candy pineapple flavor and it can used in fruit recipes to add in brightness or make it juicier. Great for giving a slight tropical note to fruit mixes as well.\n\n**Pairings:** Fruits is obvious, I think it might also work with creams. Can't really see it with any bakeries or custards though.\n\n**Closing Thoughts:** Even though I ragged on this flavor for the way it changes from realistic to candied I actually really like it. It can help lift certain fruit notes up or add in some natural sweetness (that isn't a strawberry) into a mix, and just tastes pretty damn good in general. Overall I would give it a 7/10. Its been a while since I've done one of these, so please let me know if there's anything I can do differently for future reviews!\n\n**Bonus Recipe:** So I'm gonna be a jackass and plug my own recipe, [Pearadise](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/5757#pearadise_by_wafflepriest1).\n\nIngredient | % \n:--| --:\nTPA Pineapple |  3\nTPA Pear | 6\nTPA Dragonfruit | 4\nTPA Coconut Extra | 0.5\n\nReally hope I didn't fuck up the table, and if you mix it up I hope you enjoy.
