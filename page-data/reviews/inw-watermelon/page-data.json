Or actually any other watermelon-flavored candy? \nWell, it is not much different than that. First of all - the smell. This concentrate smells just like watermelon candy, with one difference - it's slightly more sour. I expected it to be reaaaly watermelon-ly, but well, if you expect something different than what I described above, you might try something else.\n\n**The inhale.**\n\nAt the inhale, 215 Celsius the throat hit is on the milder side I would say. I can't really taste watermelon there, more like honeydew melon for me, which is nice! Similar to INW Melon.\nSomewhat creamy and a lil bit tart melon-like taste.\n\n**The exhale.**\n\nThe exhale on the other hand hits me with a quite rich mix of honeydew melon and watermelon taste, the honeydew part is definetly more natural than the watermelon fraction of this composition. So in the end, what you get is a pleasant taste of candy watermelon, kind of balanced with honeydew. By balanced, I mean that the sourness of artificial watermelon is reduced by the other one. I like that. Throat hit is still mild, but stronger than when inhaling.\n\n**Uses and pairings:**Could go well with pineapple, I would suggest pairing it with something sweeter than watermelon.\n\n**Personal testing notes**: 5% is fine, no need to go higher. Steeping for three days does the trick for me.\n\n**Second opinions:** None so far.\n\n\n**Summary:** Cheap and quite good watermelon taste, not much different than other ones I tried, but with a nice touch of honeydew. \n\nThe INW Sesame review is coming up :)\n\nquestions/co-op: mrgvape@gmail.com\n\nZni≈ºki na idym.eu/idym.eu discounts: enter YWJJ7KN5 code during checkout","author":"mrgruszka","title":"Watermelon","url":"https://redd.it/74tvgg","vendor":{"name":"Inawera","code":"INW"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"INW","title":"Watermelon"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
