Ever so slightly smokey through the first week, but that dies off after 2-3 weeks of steeping and you are left with a sweet woody tone.  There isn't really much depth here. \n\n**Off-flavors:** The inherent sweetness is a bit off to me, kind of like they should have called it \"Sweet Wood\" or something.  There's also something there that mildly numbs my tongue at 3%.\n\n**Throat hit:** 7/10 decent burn, but that sweetness helps bring it closer to the middle\n\n**Uses:** Sweet, slightly woody accent to certain flavors @ 0.5-1%.  Use at 3% is probably a bit high for this flavor.\n\n**Pairings:**   Tobaccos, nuts, booze, \"toasted\" flavorings, and maybe some herb/spice type flavors, or possibly even dark fruits.\n\n**Notes:**   I see this used prominently with tobacco and booze flavors, but depending on your mix, this might add a nice layer of depth with a cream/dark fruit combo.  To me, it is more sweet than woody at 3%, and have not had much luck with getting \"oakiness\" out of it even at lower percentages.  I don't recommend this as a standalone at all unless you are sampling and want to see for yourself.\n\n[Link to all of our flavor reviews in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)","author":"wh1skeyk1ng","title":"Oakwood","url":"https://redd.it/5jomx9","vendor":{"name":"Flavour Art","code":"FA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FA","title":"Oakwood"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
