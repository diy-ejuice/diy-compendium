Can also be used as an accent to add a tart/sour note to other creams.\n\n**Pairings**\n\nFruits, spices, peanut butter, other creams\n\n**Bonus Recipie**\n\nApple Cinnamon Yogurt\n\nIngredient|%\n:---|---:\nApple (TPA)|1\nCinnamon Ceylon (FA)|0.7\nFuji Apple (FA)|1.5\nGreek Yogurt (Flavorah)|3.75\nPear (FA)|0.5\n\n[Recipe Notes](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/4m0wxe/june_2016_recipe_thread/d3ypqlj)\n\n**Notes**\n\nWhen using as a base range from 3%-5%, at 5% the sour note is pretty prominent but a supporting cream can neutralize it. I've gone as low as 0.5% to get a noticeable sour note as an accent and as high as 1.5%.\n\nIt's a bit hard to describe the cream, although it reminds me of LOR Banana Cream without the banana. Silky smooth but otherwise tasteless, not too dense but not at all light.\n\nEdit: I would like to add that I haven't tried any other yogurt flavorings, but the realism on the sour yogurt taste without going over into spoiled milk/sour butter territory has me astounded by this flavor.\n\n**Rating** 95/100     \n\nFlavor Review Template from /u/Chrisdvr1\n\n*Please if your opinion differs, or you have another review for this post it in the comments.
