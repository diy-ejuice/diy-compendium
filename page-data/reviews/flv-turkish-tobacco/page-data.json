Why are you still here.. go buy some!!\n- Second, this flavor is good but I detect only minute differences between FLV Kentucky, Native and Turkish.\n- I happen to have a mason jar full of Turkish Izmir (real pipe tobacco which I use for NETs) and it smells nothing like FLV Turkish. That is almost an unfair comparison though because there are very few, if any, synthetic tobaccos that taste remotely similar to the real thing.\n- You can't go wrong with FLV Turkish, it's very tasty, but I'm just sort of sad that it tastes so similar to the other 2 FLV tobaccos that I mentioned.\n\n**Note**\n\nPlease, someone who has Kentucky, Native, Turkish and or Oriental, chime in if you notice major differences in each flavor. I'm starting to think I'm missing something here!! My palate seems to be working fine though, I taste all my other stuff properly.
