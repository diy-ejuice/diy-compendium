Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Decadent Vapours Ginger Biscuit, 5% and 10%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 52 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Thin crunchy ginger cookies with a whole lot of dried ginger. \n\nThe bakery here is definitely the British / almost everywhere else version of “biscuit.” Thinner, crunchy digestive type biscuit that skirts more up against a cookie than anything savory.  Lighter biscuit with a sort of coconut background note like INW/JF/CAP SL Biscuit.  That coconut note is sort of my personal cross to bear, but this seems to have less coconut to it than the CAP SL version but more than INW or JF.  Definitely a cookie, with ginger as opposed to a gingerbread cookie or a gingersnap.  No heavier, darker molasses taste and the mouthfeel is a bit thinner and crispy as opposed to really thick and chewy.\n\nBiscuit seems to be taking a bit of a backseat to a fairly heavy dried ginger.  Doesn’t feel sweet enough to really call it candied ginger.  More of a straight, dry bakery ginger.  Probably tastes most similar to HS Ginger although it’s also pretty close to standard FW Ginger.  Fairly spicy and prominent in the overall mix.\n\nAt least with this kind of steep, and at these percentages, this feels just a bit thin.  The mouthfeel on the biscuit part of this seems a bit thin while still being crispy and the ginger is kind of top-heavy and one note.  Also not as sweet as I’d expect, which is a bit odd from decadent vapours.\n\n**Off-Flavors:**  Nothing that really feels like it shouldn’t be here.  Seems a bit coconut-y to me, but that is just the biscuit.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Yeah, but ginger. Fairly aggressive ginger bite, but nothing out of line for the profile.\n\n**Percentage testing:**At 5%, this has a lot more ginger to me than biscuit.  Ginger is dry and spicy, with some thin biscuit accent on the backend.  Overall seems to vape a bit flat and feels thin.\n\nAt 10%, still a whole lot of ginger but there is a bit more biscuit.  Still kind of dry, and the biscuit is still a bit flat behind that aggressive ginger. Feels a bit less thin, but still not a really full satisfying vape  without a heavier bakery to soak up some of that ginger\n\nDV has their 20% or to taste thing, but as a S&V at 20% it didn’t really boost the bakery up for me so much as amp up the ginger to a pretty unpleasant place.  I’d mix with this closer to 10-12% with something to fill it out a bit. \n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Overall, this feels just a bit thin to me and I’d rather fill out the bakery by adding a bakery than trying to chase down more bakery texture behind that more aggressive dry ginger.  Should work well with some CAP Sugar Cookie or VT Pudding Base to add a bit more bakery grain.  If you wanted to double down on the thin and crispy thing, INW Biscuit should work.  I’d be a bit more scared of a more aggressive AP like FA Cookie, this feels crispy enough on it’s own.\n\nOutside of just filling out the cookie, you could maybe throw an ice cream or custard at this?  The texture that is here should hold up well and the ginger will come through pretty clearly. \n\n**Second Opinions:**  I can’t really find much out there about this.\n\n[Apparently this used to be called “Vapefest Original.”  I’m just going to keep posting British juice review youtube links until someone makes me stop.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0Xlsg8-qBc)\n\n[Here is the product page from DV.
