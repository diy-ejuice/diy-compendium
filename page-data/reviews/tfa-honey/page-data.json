I bought this flavor out of sheer curiosity, thinking it can't be *that* bad.  Let me tell you something, how this flavor ever hit the market is beyond me.  Maybe it's a bad joke by TFA, or maybe it only works in a 10% dilution and 1 drop per 100 mL or something, but I'm not going to f around with all that.  I'm here to talk about this flavor at 3% without a dare, a free t-shirt, or a even a free spot on the DoD top 10 list.\n\n**Setup:** Velocity clone; dual twisted 24awg Ni/28awg kanthal @ .27Î©; cotton wicks; 50 W\n\n**Testing:** The Flavor Apprentice Honey @ 3%; Aged: 15 days\n\n**Flavor description:**  Dirty and burnt tasting, in the worst possible way something could be dirty, like burnt dirt.  Burnt rubber, like someone just did a burnout in my kitchen.  Melted plastic fumes that aren't safe to inhale.  Cardboard that your shitty nephew put in the toaster, started on fire, and sprayed with water to put the fire out, tripping the GFCI that was placed there by an electrician, who was mandated to do so by the government's electrical code because they know people tend to do stupid shit like that.  It also contains 0% of anything resembling honey at 3% in a 70/30 mix with 3mg/mL nic... Maybe my nic is bad? :S \n\n**Off-flavors:** See above.\n\n**Throat hit:** 2/10 pretty mellow on the throat, but I give it 10/10 in the nostrils after the exhale.\n\n**Uses:** I mixed it with some SC Red Apple and it tastes exactly like the description above with a hint of apple.  Even with TFA Absinthe, I get slight black licorice behind a wall of burnt dirtiness.  Is that my supper burning?  Haven't even started it yet, never mind.  This flavoring makes a great gift to someone who has 200+ flavors, but not this one.  A completed collection if you will.  I'm sure this could have many other uses, but in your ejuice probably isn't one of them.\n\n**Pairings:**  It pairs great with other random flavors I have, but can't really classify into their own bag.  The trash can might not be a bad place for this one, unless you know voodoo and can post a winner in the monthly thread sometime in the next year.  I plan on keeping this around for something, but I'm not sure what for quite yet.  I'm open to suggestions though.\n\n**Notes:**  I want to note that I had this steeping before I even saw skiddz' spectacular vertical YouTube video.  It makes the review a bit more relevant given this little piece of DIY history.\n\nPlease take this review as somewhat of a suggestion as to where to spend your next $2.  If you've been in DIY for a while and you can honestly say you've spent money on stupider shit, buy it and try it for fun.  If you're new to DIY, or even if you're not new but pretty happy with your experience so far, maybe skip this one.\n\n[Bonus video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4JXnpdAUig&feature=youtu.be) of /u/skiddlzninja trying it out.  \"It tastes like living in Ohio.\"\n\n[Link to all of our flavor reviews in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)\n\n**Side note:** If you're truly after a honey flavor, I hear FA makes a far more realistic one.\n","author":"wh1skeyk1ng","title":"Honey","url":"https://redd.it/5lvwqh","vendor":{"name":"The Flavor Apprentice","code":"TFA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"TFA","title":"Honey"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
