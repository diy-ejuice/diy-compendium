    "result": {"data":{"reviewsJson":{"markdown":"**Flavor description from EuroFlavor:** *\"Originally derived from the blue whitebark raspberry fruit. Candied berries that are sweet yet slightly tangy.\"*\n\n**Percentages Tested:** 2% and 4% (both 60/40 VG/PG)\n\n**Testing Setup:** Recurve RDA with a four-wrap SS316L single clapton at 0.33 ohms. Cotton wicks. 30 watts.\n\n**Flavor Notes:** This tastes eerily similar to Hangsen Blueberry, almost like someone took Hangsen Blueberry and added a touch of dark raspberry. This has somewhat of a dense mouthfeel and a mild but not unbearable throat hit. There's a sweet stickiness that seems to be common among artificial dark berry flavors. Obviously, blue raspberry is not just blueberry and raspberry combined, but there's a definite candied blueberry note on the inhale, followed by a dark, one-dimensional raspberry taste on the exhale. The raspberry note seems like it tries to be both tart and juicy, but it falls a bit short in both respects. Even though blue raspberry is mostly considered an artificial flavor, there's somewhat of an authentic berry note lingering around.\n\nThere aren't any off notes, but after vaping this for an extended period of time, a dryness started to creep in, mostly on the inhale. This could easily be remedied by throwing in something like cactus or cucumber. FA Fuji or a lemon would make the berry note pop a lot more and help in lending some tartness. \n\nThis is very much a candy-type flavor that will work best in that type of profile. It'll likely perform well in beverages, too. I can't imagine that this would work well with bakeries, but if you wanted to add a dark sweetness to a berry jam mix, you might be able to squeeze this in somehow (similar to how you'd use FLV Boysenberry).\n\nI'd recommend this at 3-4% solo, and I'd shoot for 1-2% in a mix depending on how present you want it to be. It's a darker flavor that would mostly sit at the bottom or middle of a mix.","author":"PepperMyJabrill","title":"Blue Raspberry","url":"https://redd.it/9vlzvg","vendor":{"name":"Euro Flavor","code":"EF"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"EF","title":"Blue Raspberry"}},
