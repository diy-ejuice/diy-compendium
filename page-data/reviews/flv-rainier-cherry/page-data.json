    "result": {"data":{"reviewsJson":{"markdown":"**Setup:** Velocity 2 Clone, Dual 15 wrap 3mm Nifethal 70 coils @.18 ohms.  45W power, 480F temp limit. Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Rainier Cherry @ 3%, 70/30 VG/PG, Steeped 13 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Bright almost astringent cherry candy note, before everything goes completely off the rails.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Plastic.  All plastic all the time. Begins with that candy note and just ends in a plastic mess.  Not even fancy plastic.  Like dollar store knock-off GI Joe straight out of the package plastic.\n\n**Throat Hit:** 5/10. Fairly smooth, for plastic.\n\n**Uses:**  The candy cherry note might be useful in candies if you can use a lower percentage for just the top notes.  Although I'm pretty sure that plastic is going to be just as prominent as the candy note.\n\n**Pairings:** A trash can. TFA Gummy candy. FW Hard candy if you want to get a pretty rocking cherry cough drop going on.\n\n**Notes:**  So, cherry is apparently tricky.  This is my full disclosure that I haven't tried a lot of cherries, but so far my research is less than positive.  Welcome to land of off-flavors and cough syrup.  I've largely avoided them.  I picked up INW Cherries, and while I'm not in love, it's good enough for an admittedly artifical cherry note.  \n\nFlavorah gave me a ray of hope with a couple of their cherry flavors.  We are both from the great state of Washington.  We grow a whole lot of cherries.  The two major commercial varieties are going to be the darker red bing cherries and the yellow and mottled red rainier cherries.  Rainier cherries are by far the superior cherry for eating raw. Washingtononian as they are, I was hoping they understood the cherry and would produce something accordingly delicious.  Maybe a nice realistic sweet rainier cherry, which has more of a normal stone fruit vibe as compared to the cloying flavor of a bing cherry.\n\nThey did not.  Unless my taste buds are 100% off on this one, I'm having a hard time thinking of a good use for this.  If anyone else has a different impression of this flavor please share.  I don't want to be this negative about any flavor, but I'm not seeing a value through that plastic haze.","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Rainier Cherry","url":"https://redd.it/5ang2m","vendor":{"name":"Flavorah","code":"FLV"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FLV","title":"Rainier Cherry"}},
