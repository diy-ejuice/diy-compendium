Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** CAP Blackberry @ %3 steeped 31 days, @ 6% steeped 7 days. 60/40 VG/PG.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  If I had to guess blind, this tastes like a blackberry, grape, and coconut marshmallow flavor at 3%. At 6%, it gets closer to an actual blackberry, but with a hint of spearmint that gets weird and medicinal.\n\nAt 3%, Inhale is sharper floral blackberry.  Not really dense, but pretty warm overall.  The sharper florals mask a lot of the sweetness on the inhale. The exhale starts with blackberry top notes and a syrupy flat grape sweetness. Coconut really comes out on the back half, working way up from underneath that grape.  Overall I get a lot of fluffy texture, and the coconut is taking that into marshmallow territory.  The florals here linger a bit and turn bitter. That coconut thing also sticks around for a while.  At 6%, The coconut and all that kind of fills out to a spearmint backnote but the entire thing seems a bit unsaturated with actual blackberry.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Down low, I get a waxy coconut sweetness, loud and clear. Almost a a less intense TPA Coconut Candy.  And there is that super fluffy texture.  Up higher, a kind of spearmint cooling vibe.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Light. It's definitely there on the exhale, but nothing too remarkable.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Eh, it's probably a decent enough blackberry, especially for custards and bakeries where there is some serious body to carry the profile.  [/u/SadPandaVapes/ used this some FW Blueberry backup, which is pretty smart.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/5dnpc6/blackberry_custard_pie/)  If you wanted a more realistic blackberry, a small percentage of FA Bilberry would probably help.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nCouple notes on ELR about this being pretty concentrated, but I have to say I just don't see it. S&V Concentration testing, at .25%, this is really light. Good hint of blackberry flavor, but it's just barely there and incredibly thin. At .5%, largely the same but has a bit more a flat candy kind of vibe.  It's a good flavor, but it's way too subtle.  1% doesn't seem a lot stronger than .5%, but I'm getting just a hint of that coconut. 2% is still light for me.  3% is starting to really flesh out. The blackberry is more pronounced, but so is the coconut and it's getting that distracting fluffiness. 4% actually rounds those floral notes out fairly well, but I'm getting more of a slightly cooling kind of spearmint off flavor, on top everything else going on here.  At 5% I'm getting a clearer blackberry and that coconut is kept in check by the spearmint thing. 6% and 7% is a bit medicinal for me.  I'd actually suggest this as a primary note, up between 4-6%.  Lower concentrations have a lot of weird off flavors that I wouldn't want to mess with.\n\nSeems to really need a heavy hand with flavoring, at least for my tastes. If you're having issues with this go bold. It's still not a fantastic blackberry,  it just doesn't seem to saturate the vape... but it's a lot closer at 5% then 3%.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[ELR notes are, as usual, all over the place.
