Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Red Cinnamon @ 1% and 1 drop per 10 ml (about .25%), 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 7 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  ...and that's just Red Hots.  Heavily spicy and sweet bright red cinnamon candy. Moderately dense and pretty accurate to an actual HFCS/sugar candy note, without any artificial sweetener taste or chemical off flavors.  On the crazy strong side of things. I personally get about all I want out of this flavor at 1 drop per 10ml, but there's nothing really stopping you if you're a masochist and want to go higher.\n\nInhale is sharp, moderately dense, very sweet red hot candy. Intensely spicy candy cinnamon in the top notes and a syrupy sweet candy base.  No trace of artificial-tasting sweetener notes, spot on for an actual candy flavor.  Exhale starts off with a really sweet red hot candy base, with the spicier top notes really ramping up and peaking in about the middle of the exhale.  The spicier part of the cinnamon tails off a bit towards the back end of the vape, with a slightly earthy, mentholish kind of note that I'm getting severe redneck Fireball whiskey flashbacks from.  Syrupy, moderately dense mouthfeel even at 1 drop per 10ml.  Finish has lingering candy cinnamon heat and a sticky mouthfeel.\n\n**Off-flavors:** I get a bit of earthiness and almost a menthol coolness after that big rush of sweet bright red cinnamon.  I remembering getting the same thing off Fireball whiskey and the actual red cinnamon red hots and cinnamon bears, so I don't think it really counts as off. Nothing bitter or chemical here.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Yeah, but that's the point.  Nothing chemically harsh, but it's a pretty intense flavor.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This is red hots, straight up. It's a pretty solid red hots flavor, but I don't see a whole lot of applications outside of candy cinnamon profiles. Maybe a Fireball whiskey vape, but you're talking bright red and very sweet.\n\n**Notes:**  This is very concentrated. I made a really quick dilution, and even at .1% I get a clear cinnamon red hots flavor. Not super sweet this low, but still very present and identifiable. .2% is already pushing into full syrupy profile, and that spice is just ramping up. .4% is pushing it for me. Nothing off tasting really, but it's a bit unpleasantly spicy and sharp and only getting sweeter.  1% is overkill. Nothing that tastes bad, but it's just really intense. For science, I bumped the percentage up to 3%.  I wanted to test if this gets chemical or weird at higher percentages, and it doesn't.  It did blow the taste buds straight out my head though. It works this high, but you'd have to be some kind of lunatic to enjoy this.  Super linear flavor, this is all going to be personal preference. I find this is more than spicy enough for me at .25%, but it won't magically start tasting like garbage if you push it higher.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nNot really.\n[And here is the FLV product page. Their description: \"Red Cinnamon like a candy cinnamon bear or red hot. Can be a good seasonal cinnamon for spicing up a flavor, but it is strong and spicy.\"  One 5-star review on there from user \"Oldies Mike\" who reports: \"Preferred single flavor mix: 1% (2 drops per 10ml) At this amount, it is a total replica of \"Red Hots\" the candy.\"](http://store.flavorah.com/concentrated-red-cinnamon-flavor)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Red Cinnamon","url":"https://redd.it/6a8a11","vendor":{"name":"Flavorah","code":"FLV"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FLV","title":"Red Cinnamon"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
