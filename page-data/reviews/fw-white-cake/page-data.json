Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FW White Cake, 2 and 4%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 7 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Pretty mellow cake with some light frosting. Pretty good cake texture without a really heavy \"cake\" favor to it. Doesn't really have any richer buttery or eggy notes to it. Not a lot of frosting here, but what is here doesn't have the weird artificial note that their birthday cake did.  I'd use this if I needed a really light cake note to pair up with more delicate flavors.  i'd stay at around 5%, after that it gets a bit dry.\n\nInhale is kind of nondescript. Lighter cake flavor with a fair bit of texture.  I'm getting maybe a light bit of vanilla but it's pretty subtle against that grainier note. A bit of wax from the frosting, but nothing really rich or heavy. Moderately sweet and fairly dense without tasting heavy or rich. Exhale has more of that lighter grain up front. Fluffy rather than dense. Frosting is still pretty light and the sweetness from the frosting note kind of feels like it's bleeding through the entire vape instead of staying put up top. Frosting has a light artificial vanilla,  but fairly waxy. Fairly clean finish overall.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  I think this is pretty accurate to the white cake profile.  It's a light flavor, but white cake is fairly light by itself. Frosting note is a bit thin and flat.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Nah, pretty smooth.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Even if this drops all the questionable stuff from FW Yellow Cake, it doesn't really seem like a satisfying sub.  There is a lot of texture, but not a whole lot actual cake taste here and I don't think it will work in the same applications as yellow cake flavors do. I think pairing this with heavy or aggressive flavors is going to basically bury this.\n\nI'd save this for when you want a lighter delicate cake flavor to pair with more intricate and subtle accents.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing this seems limited mostly by the dryness of that cake note. 2% is light and a little chalky. Kind of has a light raw flour taste to it. 4% tastes a little more cooked and like a (light) cake flavor. Frosting note still seems pretty light though. 6% is getting fairly dry for me, that grainy texture and underflavored cake base gets a bit weird.  Frosting is actually a bit better up here, but that cake base feels a bit cardboard-y. 8% feels way too dry overall and is starting to get some pretty pronounced bitterness.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nIt's a new flavor, so not really.\n\n[Here's the product page from Flavorwest. No SDS up yet, so no clue as to whatever weirdness this may contain.
