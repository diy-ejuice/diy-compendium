{"componentChunkName":"component---src-components-review-js","path":"/reviews/fa-royal-orange","result":{"data":{"reviewsJson":{"markdown":"**Setup:** Recoil w/ flavor barrel, Dual 15 wrap 26g 3mm Nifethal 70 coils @.18 ohms.  60w power, 450F temp limit. Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FA Royal Orange @ .5% and 1.5%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 8 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Navel orange. Some warmer, waxy citrus base and a slightly dry orange juice top note. Tastes a lot like [FLV Orange Citrus](https://redd.it/5hzkrr) and [CAP Juicy Orange](https://redd.it/5do6oo) combined.  Brighter than the Orange Citrus though, and without the harshness I get from the Juicy Orange. Nothing too sharp or harsh here, pretty mellow and full. Just a bit weaker than you'd expect from a Flavourart citrus,  I'd use between 1% - 3%.\n\nInhale has a bit of sharper orange zest, with a slightly powdery tangerine body. Inhale is warmer as opposed to really crisp and tart, with a pretty full mouthfeel and solid but not cloying sweetness.  Exhale has a warm and waxy base,  pretty accurate navel orange sweetness. Some bright orange juice in the top notes.  Slightly tart and a bit dry, but not harsh or sharp.  Overall effect is kind of like a orange juice from concentrate without quite as much recommended water added in.  Clean finish overall, with some lighter orange zest notes.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Nothing that really seems out of place.  Maybe a bit warm and fuller than a straight citrus flavor, but it's fairly balanced and the entire thing works pretty well.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Fairly light, which is cool for a citrus.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  While this has some brightness along with that fuller body, I'm not sure it's a great choice for a primary note in a straight fruit mix.  I think you can get some body and zest out of this when mixed with other fruits, but I'd want something else to be the star of the show. For a citrus mix, I think adding a brighter, more acidic grapefruit or lime on top of this to draw focus in the recipe would work best.  You could throw just about any kind of fruit and use this for some warmth, body, and lighter smooth zest notes and let something else take the spotlight.\n\nGood choice for pairing with creams and custards, or bakeries. The lack of strong, bright acidity is going to let this blend well without making the entire too bright or harsh.\n\nBody here would also work for orange or citrus based candies. Just enough realism to ground the profile, but not enough to really dominate.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nConcentration testing, this is just a bit lighter than I'd expect. .25% has some light zest notes, and a bit of warmer body.  .5% has a bit of brightness and tartness up top in addition to that light zest. Body feels about the same. Flavor overall feels a bit light.  1% has a brighter top note.  Still light, but less so. Some bright acidity starting to peek out, with the same fuller body.  1.5% has a heavier, warmer body to it, but you're still getting some fresher, brighter notes.  2% has a heavier body still, tastes a lot like slightly less than fresh orange juice, where the top notes have been driven off the juice a bit. 3% is getting a bit powdery in the top notes, along with that heavier body.  4% is getting a bit harsh and heavy.  I'd recommend using this at 1% for a citrus zest accent, and around 2%-3% for a base flavor, depending on how well that powdery note works with the rest of your mix.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nStill pretty new, so not a lot out there.\n\n[Here's the ELR Page. One note by user \"Alpha One\" saying it tastes weak at 1.5%](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/159545)\n\n[The page from Flavourart.  Worth noting they are callling it \"Royal Orange Juice\".
