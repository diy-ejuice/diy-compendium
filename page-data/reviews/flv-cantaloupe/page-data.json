Very smooth flavor, semi sweet, nice cantaloupe. It's perfectly ripe; I don't detect any of the green parts close to the rind, or rind itself. It does get a little sharp on the throat if used too high. In trying this at a single flavor at 2% and in a mix at 1%, those seem like good places to start with it. The throat was a little sharper than I would like at both of those %s, so if you want to avoid a sharp throat, I might suggest bringing them a touch lower (1.5% & 0.75% respectively).  \n\nOne thing that's interesting about this flavoring is how well it accents fruit and cream mixes, particularly \"orange\" fruits (mango, apricot, peach, etc.). It does a great job at bringing a non-citrus \"orange\" accent to a mix that is smooth and velvety. Experimentations with Mango Lassi found the cantaloupe to round out the mango nicely while also lending some additional creaminess that it needed without any unwanted dairy notes (used @ 0.5%).  \n\n**On the Nose**  \nA subtle, ripe, sweet, cantaloupe-esque scent.\n\n**Usage**  \n*Stand alone*: 1.5-2%. You get a really nice cantaloupe at 2%, but it's a touch harsh; bringing it down to 1.5% reduces the harshness to an acceptable level in my book, but is a bit underwheling by itself.\n\n*In a mix*: 0.25-1% depending if you're going for an \"orange\" creamy aspect, or more forward cantaloupe flavor.  \n\n**Throat**  \nHarsh\n\n**Pairings**  \nCreams, other melons, \"orange\" fruits, berries, other fruits.  \n\n**Avoid**  \nCoffee, heavy caramels/butterscotches, overly eggy or dairy flavors/mixes. I want to say tobacco, but it might actually work well as an accent to like an apricot tobacco or something.  \n\n**Steep**  \nI'd give this one 2 days. It's a fruit so it doesn't need much time for that cantaloupe flavor to come through, but if you want the full effect of the velvety texture it's best to let this one harmonize with the other flavorings for a bit. Seems to hold a steep pretty well from 1-3 weeks, but haven't kept a mix around more than a month. \n\n**Quick Recipe: Melon Mix**  \n*Ratio: 10PG/90VG*  \n*Steep: 3+ days*  \n\n* FLV Wild Melon @ 1.5%  \n* FLV Cantaloupe @ 0.75%  \n* TFA Marshmallow @ 1%  \n* FLV Cream @ 1%  \n\nIn this recipe you can see how the cantaloupe lends itself to accent the melon mixture by offering its delicious sweet cantaloupe flavor, as well as aiding the cream base. If you sub this cantaloupe for a different one, you'd find yourself with a tasty mix that has a good cantaloupe note to it, but it wouldn't be quite as creamy. I find this % of cantaloupe to be enough to push that forward cantaloupe flavor you're looking for, while benefiting the creams and keeping the harsh throat under control.","author":"CheebaSteeba","title":"Cantaloupe","url":"https://redd.it/4nf26x","vendor":{"name":"Flavorah","code":"FLV"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FLV","title":"Cantaloupe"}},
