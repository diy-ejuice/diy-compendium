I hope it helps.\n\nThese flavors really do need at least a 4 week steep to fully develop the flavors. VG just doesn't carry the flavor like PG. However, even using higher percentages, if they are single flavors it's not using any more flavoring than they usual 15-20% of combines flavors that is commonly used with a lot of flavoring. These are not super concentrated like INW or FA.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Butterscotch Pudding**\n\n- At 10% @ 1 week steep. Slightly weak, but very good and sweet. Creamy sweet butterscotch dominant at this point, creamy back note. Not really getting an \"instant pudding\" type flavor at this point, but it's still early. Nice thick mouth feel. Almost like a creamy rich butterscotch candy. Could easily be a stand alone with proper steep I think. Will try again at 4 weeks. I think with normal steeping times that creamy aspect will really strengthen, and will move more in the pudding direction. Right now I would say 10-12% tank 8-10% dripper for single flavor, 4-6% in blends. Will update with further testing. I really really like this, having  a hard time putting it down.\n- At a 4 week steep. AMAZING! Straight up (insert famous maker here) butterscotch  Instant Pudding! Nothing like the other butterscotches or the ice cream syrup. This has matured wonderfully, I am going to start with 12-15% stand alone for tanks. Must get more!!!! This will be going fast. @Walt please make some famous maker instant pistachio pudding. Pleaseeeeeeee!\n\n","author":"mysticrosell","title":"Butterscotch Pudding VG Version","url":"https://redd.it/4rh5ke","vendor":{"name":"Real Flavors","code":"RF"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"RF","title":"Butterscotch Pudding VG Version"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
