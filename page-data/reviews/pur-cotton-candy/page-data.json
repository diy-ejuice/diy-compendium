Sweet sugar.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Flavor Description:** 3 Days at 4%:  This really surprised me. Even at only 4% I'm getting a light cotton candy. It's sweet, but not sickening. Texture is not dry, but no body to it. The pink kind...lol. It's only been 3 days, but with a longer steep and higher percentage I this will be an authentic cotton candy and not just sugar. I'm going to bump this up to 8% and try again in another week.\n\n10 Days at 8%:  It's still a light flavor, but no doubt it's an authentic pink cotton candy. This isn't dry, but still has no discernible body to it. It's not quite as sweet as the real thing, which is great for me personally. I'm not thinking it will stand up to other flavors well due to the lightness, but further testing is required to know for sure. If you are looking for a stand alone cotton candy then this is it in the 8-12% range.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:** None\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit:** 1/10\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Pairings:** Anywhere you want sweetening in very low percentages or with very very small hints of mild fruits like strawberry or blue raspberry for a fruity cotton candy.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Notes:** I think this is best as cotton candy. It's a good single flavor as is and doesn't have the dryness or generic sweetness I have gotten from other brands. I'm not sure I would mix it with anything. I like the pink cotton candy by itself around 10%. It's limited in use really to a single flavor for me. Maybe I need a better imagination....please let me know what you make with this :) \n","author":"mysticrosell","title":"Cotton Candy","url":"https://redd.it/62r97p","vendor":{"name":"Purilum","code":"PUR"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"PUR","title":"Cotton Candy"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
