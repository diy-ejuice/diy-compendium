Nic%/0.\n\n**Mouthfeel**\nLight on the tongue and nose, mild moderate mouthfeel not very dense\n4 out of 10\n\n**Throat Hit** 1/10, if there is any!\n\n**Flavor Properties**\nVery sweetened flavoring feels like OVER ripe watermelon that left under the sun for 2 days. Somehow semi-candy flavor, not realistic. I couldn’t taste and rind taste. \n\n**Off Flavors**\nFor me, chemical taste after 8%.\n\n**Position In The Recipe**\nShould work fine in candy recipes in 4-6%, but I think it can benefit from other watermelon flavor in the mix. Also, I believe there are more realistic watermelon flavors. \n\n**Pairings**\nOther candied flavors. It can work very well with TFA strawberry in my opinion.\n\n**Suggested %:**\nSolo: 7-8%\nIn mix:- 4-6%\n\n* works as SNV, there is no change in taste with steeping.\n\n**Rating 40/100**\n\n\n* *Please if your opinion differs, or you have another review for this post it in the comments.*\n* *I haven’t seen many reviews on Hiliq flavors here or other websites, so I wanted to do one. I have other flavors but still I haven’t tried them.*\n* *It’s my first time to do review, forgive any mistakes. I just wanted to add something to this great community.*","author":"ClownMask07","title":"Watermelon","url":"https://redd.it/dznnt7","vendor":{"name":"HiLIQ","code":"HL"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"HL","title":"Watermelon"}},
