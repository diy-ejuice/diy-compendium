Power at 80 Watts  \n\n**Testing:** TFA Oatmeal Cookie @ 5%, 70/30 VG/PG, Steeped: 1 week  \n\n**Flavor Description:** This flavor is a dry, slightly sweet grainy cookie. I don't get much oatmeal but rather a grainy texture. It has a slightly nutty exhale and aftertaste. The cookie flavor is reminiscent of a crunchy rather than soft baked cookie.  \n\n**Off Flavors:** I almost get a bit of soured milk flavor from this. It isn't terribly off putting just not exactly what you want in a cookie.  I think it might be an attempt at butter.\n\n**Throat Hit:** 4\\10. The first few puffs of this flavor is a little stingy in the throat but calms down once you've been vaping for a bit.  \n\n**Uses:** You could definitely turn this into a decent oatmeal cookie if you add to the oatmeal layer. Maybe with ooo Oatmeal or flv oatmeal raisin. It has that dry crunchy feature you look for in oatmeal cookies. This would also make a good base for a peanut butter cookie as it has that nutty taste to it. This might also be good to add like a crumble on apple cobblers or parfaits at a lower percentage.  \n\n**Pairings:** This would be good with fa maple or caramel. Basically any fruit you like with oatmeal would go good with this flavor as well. I can see custards and creams pairing nicely with this flavor too to moisten it up. Sugar cookie would work nice to sweeten this flavor and turn it into a softer cookie.  \n\n**Notes:** I can see where TFA was trying to go with this flavor. Although it doesn't have a lot of oatmeal flavor you get the impression of oatmeal with the graininess and nuttiness of this cookie. I think with a little bit of help, this could really be a great flavor.  \n\n**Second Opinions:**  [Not many people on elr get an oatmeal flavor either](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/23866)  \n[ spaceghost_n_moltar found the flavor to be cinnamon-y and cakey and used it in their muffin man clone](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/49rk5j/the_final_results_of_my_quest_to_clone_muffin_man/)  \n[cswindz found it to be disapointing when trying to use it in their oatmeal ice cream recipe](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/4bi41c/oatmeal_oatmeal_oatmeal/)  \n\n##[Other flavor reviews on the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)\n\n\n\n","author":"mlNikon","title":"Oatmeal Cookie","url":"https://redd.it/5f2fqy","vendor":{"name":"The Flavor Apprentice","code":"TFA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"TFA","title":"Oatmeal Cookie"}},
