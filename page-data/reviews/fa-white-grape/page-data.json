    "result": {"data":{"reviewsJson":{"markdown":"**Setup:** Recoil w/ flavor barrel, Dual 15 wrap 26g 3mm Nifethal 70 coils @.18 ohms.  60w power, 450F temp limit. Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FA White Grape @ %2, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 7 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Tastes a whole lot like muscat grapes. Jammy sweetness with musky / floral top notes. Light bit of tannic peel. Concentrate doesn't taste a whole lot like 'murican white table grapes, but muscat grapes really don't either.\n\nInhale is relatively light with sharp soapy florals and just a bit of a deeper sweetness. Exhale has some darker, muskier floral grape top notes. Not unpleasant and fairly accurate to grapes of a vine. Jammy base sweetness, leaving a kind of sticky, sugary mouthfeel.  Slight tannic tartness overall, like you'd get from grape skins. Those florals linger quite a bit and get bitter by the end of the exhale.  This concentrate lacks a lot of the mid-range you'd get from a more straight-forward \"purple\" kind of grape flavor.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Definitely has a floral edge to it that can taste a little like hairspray or really cheap wine. 2% is probably pushing it with this concentrate.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light. Little bit of hit on the exhale.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I'd suggest this as a grape additive more than anything else, kind of working like a tiny percentage of lychee would to give a more candy grape flavor some realism from those top notes. This has the added benefit of adding some darker, sweeter, jammy notes along with it.  This isn't really pleasant enough to take center stage in a mix, but may have some use as a general fruit sweetener if you like mixes a bit more complex and interesting.\n\nI'd stay well clear of creams and bakeries. Those floral notes really aren't going to play too well with anything creamy, buttery, or dense.\n\nThat sort of cheap alcohol bite from the florals here should be pretty useful in cocktail vapes that include a brighter wine component.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nS&V Concentration testing, 2% is defintely overkill.  At .25%, this is mostly a subtle grape sweetness.  I'm still getting just a hint of those higher grape florals as well, but overall the flavor is pretty weak.  .5% is actually pretty good. Still not reading overtly \"grape\" but you get a deep grape sweetness and just a bit floral grape top notes. .75% is getting to be a bit more clearly grape, as those top notes fill in. No big bump in sweetness over .5%. 1% is getting floral, and that sweetness underneath is getting jammy. 1.5% is sharper and pushing pretty far floral-forward, but that jammyness is getting pretty full. 2% and over is too floral for me, as the darker sweetness and top notes just seem to be moving farther and farther apart.  I'd start with this at .5% for a general fruit sweetener, and .75% and move up for backup for a more straight-forward grape flavor like INW Grapes.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Hic Notes:](http://mamajsflavorshop.com/headinclouds-my-notes-on-flavor-descriptions/)\n\n\"Tastes like a handful of white wine grapes plucked from the vine and eaten, skin and all. This is very useful for making the flavors of real fruit-juice blends. Look at the ingredients on a 100% juice blend, and youâ€™re likely to see white grape juice in the listing. It does get a little aromatic around 2%, but add 1% or less to sweeten other fruits without adding much grape flavor. For a more neutral fruity sweetener, see FA Pear.\"\n\n[/u/m_i_r_/ says this stuff tastes likes moscato wine, which I could totally see.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/2wpsnr/flavourart_white_grape/)\n\nCouple of other quick mentions on the sub, both in comments for some Grape, WTF? type posts. /u/TheAlmightyD/ calls it \"decent\" [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/3wjf6c/i_need_a_good_grape_or_a_grape_base/)  /u/jacatro/ calls it \"good\" [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/4jt2pk/where_is_all_the_grape/)\n\n[ELR page isn't great, but it does have a mention of this being really similar to FA Lychee.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/218)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"White Grape","url":"https://redd.it/5wjupb","vendor":{"name":"Flavour Art","code":"FA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FA","title":"White Grape"}},
