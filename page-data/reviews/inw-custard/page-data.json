Aged 17 days\n\n**Flavor Description:** A sweet eggy custard with vanilla backnote. Very creamy and bright. A full flavor but without feeling heavy. \n\n\n**Off-flavors:** None\n\n**Throat Hit:** 1/10\n\n**Uses & Pairings:** Definite use in custards and other bakery flavors. Feels like it will go well with most berry fruits and possibly citrus. The sweetness would probably pair well with RY4s and other tabaccos.\n\n\n**Notes:** I'm not the biggest fan of bakeries but at 3% this makes a great standalone flavor for me. very concentrated so i can see it being used in a mix in the 1.5% to 2% range. Others have suggested a 3 week steep for this but i honestly didn't notice any changes after the first week and a half or so.\n\n\n**Second Opinions:** [ELR user](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/21741) Sthrnmixer says \"Delicious - rivals Capella Vanilla Custard V1 at lower usage percent. Used at 3% is as good as CAP at 8%. Steep time is also less with flavor maturing in 2 weeks. The aroma smells kind of eggy but the flavor at 3% is not. Suspect higher use would bring that out. This will be especially useful when wanting to keep overall flavor percent low yet looking for that rich, complex and/or layered mix.\" at least used one w/ a bit more complexity). Vapor is thick and smooth.\" \n\nA [Bull City Flavor Reviewer](http://www.bullcityflavors.com/custard-inw/) had this to say, \"Very nice flan/creme brûlée custard without the burnt sugar crust or any citrus, but with a touch of cookie/biscuit and some light vanilla. Straight-forward, light, and so far it's been easy to mix with. \n\nI used this at 2%, and it took on a slightly chemical taste at higher percentages. Looking forward to seeing how it tastes with a longer steep.\"\n\n**Quick Recipe**: Pistachio Lemon Custard (WIP)\n\nRatio: 70VG/30PG\n\nSteep: 2 weeks\n\nMFG | Flavor | Percentage\n---|------|----------\nTFA | Pistachio | 3%\nJF | Lemon Juicy | 2%\nINW | Custard | 2%\nFA | Custard | 3%\n\nI used INW custard at what i felt would be the high side of the in a mix usage for the rich eggy flavor. I used a combination of FA Custard and JF Lemon Juicy to add a lemon note to complement the brightness of INW Custard and TFA Pistachio to bring a little bit of nutty darkness to the party. \n\nOverall i like this vape, especially the lemony mixed with custard. in future iterations i think i'm going to drop the Pistachio, after trying several recipes with it i think i'm just not a fan. Also in consideration is adding some FW Butterscotch Ripple at a low percentage to bring some more creamy caramel into play.\n\n[Link to all of our flavor reviews in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)","author":"Boondoc","title":"Custard","url":"https://redd.it/5qpztf","vendor":{"name":"Inawera","code":"INW"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"INW","title":"Custard"}},
