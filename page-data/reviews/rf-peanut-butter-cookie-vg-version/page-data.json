I hope it helps. These flavors really do need at least a 4 week steep to fully develop the flavors. VG just doesn't carry the flavor like PG. However, even using higher percentages, if they are single flavors it's not using any more flavoring than they usual 15-20% of combines flavors that is commonly used with a lot of flavoring. These are not super concentrated like INW or FA.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Peanut Butter Cookie**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- At 10% @ 1 week steep. Slightly weak at this short steep, but still yummy! Weaker than other RF flavors I've tried so far. I can't decide if it tastes more like cookie dough, or baked cookies? Maybe soft baked PB cookies just slightly on the doughy side? Nice natural tasting pb, not dry tasting at all. Sweet but not too sweet. Getting some kind of bright note, can't quite place it yet? Maybe vanilla, but almost fruity? Will have to figure it out. Will update again at 4 week steep. Not sure of SF percentages yet. Will wait and see how much it strengthens with steeping, but not a strong/good S&V at 10%.\n- At a 4 week steep. This flavor is much better now, gotten stronger. Good fresh baked PB Cookie, still moist tasting, but that doughy aspect isn't as strong. Might consider increasing to 12-15% in a tank. I don't taste any off or fruity note now, must have steeped out. I'm hoping it holds it's own against custards for a PB Cookie Custard :)","author":"mysticrosell","title":"Peanut Butter Cookie VG Version","url":"https://redd.it/4rh6pw","vendor":{"name":"Real Flavors","code":"RF"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"RF","title":"Peanut Butter Cookie VG Version"}},
