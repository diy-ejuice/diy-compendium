Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Apple Cider @ 3%, 70/30 VG/PG, Steeped 9 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Tastes like a grocery store apple cider, which is a good thing.  No skin, no spice notes, no real \"stewed\" taste.  Darker than an apple juice flavor.\n\n**Off-flavor:s** None that I'm getting.\n\n**Throat Hit:** 4/10. It's there but not too obnoxious or out of line with something like FA Fuji.\n\n**Uses:**  Seems obvious, but apple cider. Mulled cider with some additional spice notes. Baked apples.  Anything that you want a more realistic and not candied apple flavor.\n\n**Pairings:**  Bakeries, Whiskey, Spices, Citrus, Pears.  Anything that calls for a darker apple flavor.\n\n**Notes:**  (Pleasantly) Surprised by this flavor.  Dipped into it on day 3 and it was an absolute mess.  Took longer that I'd guess for a single flavor to come together.  It pretty much does what it says on the tin.  Tastes a lot like FA Fuji with a tiny amount of FA Liquid Amber, although maybe a bit less juicy.  I would think it compares favorably to something like HS Apple mix if you want to build a cider flavor from the ground up.  Really solid, although probably inessential because of the Fuji and Liquid Amber trick.","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Apple Cider","url":"https://redd.it/59y44n","vendor":{"name":"Flavorah","code":"FLV"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FLV","title":"Apple Cider"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
