No fizziness like you'd expect from the name, but somewhat reminiscent of flat champagne.  \n\n**Off-flavors:**  May seem a bit yeasty at higher percentages.  Missing the fizzy champagne sparkle.\n\n**Throat hit:** 2/10 Pretty tame on the tongue too.\n\n**Uses:**  Since it doesn't really provide effervescence (at least to me), I would suggest it as an accent to other fruits, or as a sort of emulsifier to help meld sharp flavors together.\n\n**Pairings:** Grape, apple, citrus flavors, or any other fruits you might expect in wine.\n\n**Notes:**   IMO, not an overly strong flavor, rather boring by itself.  FA Liquid Amber or FA Brandy at lower percentages might work as substitutes in a recipe if you don't have this one in your stash.\n\nEDIT: As /u/apexified stated in my recent discussion about this flavor, FW Pink Champagne might be a better option for a fizzy note. \n\nEDIT 2: For those of you still searching for effervescence, check out [FA Cola](https://redd.it/59bs68). You might have better luck with fizzy aspects there too. \n\nEDIT 3: [Link to all of our flavor reviews in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)\n","author":"wh1skeyk1ng","title":"Champagne","url":"https://redd.it/54hosi","vendor":{"name":"The Flavor Apprentice","code":"TFA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"TFA","title":"Champagne"}},
