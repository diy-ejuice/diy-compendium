Not as cool as koolada or menthol, but almost a very light on the menthol menthol cigarette. Not a leafy pipe tobacco, nor a spicy cigar tobacco, I think this is more of a special foreign cigarette flavor. I am struggling to place the flavor other than cooling. Probably nutty? Not super dark, but not light. Rather flat. I think this would be a good flavor to make menthol camels with.\n\nOff-flavors: the Cooling sensation.\n\nThroat hit: none for me.\n\nUses and pairings: I think this is a good cigarette tobacco, so maybe DNB, and maybe some of the flavorah cigarette tobaccos and menthol, but i wouldn't put this in a pipe mix.\n\nSecond Opinions: \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/5uvngi/flv_arabian_tobacco/\n\n","author":"[deleted]","title":"Arabian Tobacco","url":"https://redd.it/6mic58","vendor":{"name":"Flavorah","code":"FLV"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FLV","title":"Arabian Tobacco"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
