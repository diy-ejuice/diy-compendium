It's not artificial tasting, but it's not a fresh sweet and tart berry either. The taste is a dark, ripe and juicy boysenberry that has been cooked down with sugar, like a jam or pie filling. The inhale is deep rich blackberry/boysenberry and the exhale brings the brighter notes with just a faint tang.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:** None\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit:** 4/10 It does have a just little bite to it.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Pairings:** All other berries, apple, pears, coconut, honey,  nut, cardamon, cinnamon, cream cheese, creams, ice cream, custard,cookies, cakes, pies, tarts, danishes, bakeries, tobaccos. This is an excellent choice for any baked goods as the fruit already has that cooked flavor and will blend well.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Notes:** The floral perfume aroma present in the concentrate has steeped out, and I don't taste or smell any in this at the 2 week steep. It wasn't extremely prominent, just a hint. I recommend 48-72 hours steep at minimum to avoid it, and the slight bite from the berry really drops off after the 1 week mark. For me I think a nice strength for a single flavor is 5-8% and 1.5-3% in mixes.","author":"mysticrosell","title":"Boysenberry Preserves","url":"https://redd.it/5skm21","vendor":{"name":"Purilum","code":"PUR"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"PUR","title":"Boysenberry Preserves"}},
