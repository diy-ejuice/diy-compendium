Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** HS Raspberry @ 1% and 3%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 7 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  At low percentages strawberry hard candies (you know, [these.)](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51RSQ1uuNvL._SY355_.jpg) Almost indistinguishable from a weaker version of INW Wild Strawberry for me.\n\nInhale is all sweet candy strawberry. Still sticky sweet on the exhale. Dense and intense jammy strawberry hard candy. Really offputting sharp green flavor notes through the entire exhale and lingering on the back end. \n\n**Off-flavors:**  I'm going call that entire green flavor an off-flavor.  I've never been into it. YMMV, but I'm not a fan.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light throat hit, nothing too major.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I'd borrow wholesale from the uses for INW Wild Strawberry.  The only real use I see is adding some of that sweet jammy strawberry into fruit mixes and to pop other sweet berries.  That green note is going to get really weird when mixed with creams or bakeries.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nPercentage used is absolutely vital here. At 1% and below, I get a jammy candy strawberry.  If I start to go higher, this gets weird quick.  That overpowering green flavor starts to really push toward the front and by 2% I'd call it damn near unvapeable.  I'd use this as a supporting note at around .5% and maybe 1% for a primary note.  I'd really advise against using this higher than that.\n\nThis is really weird for me. Subjectively, I really don't enjoy this.  Objectively, it doesn't strike me as a raspberry, and it seems awful similar to INW Wild Strawberry.\n\n**Second Opinions:** \n\n[One note on ELR, reading only:  \"Preferred single flavor mix: 15.0% \"](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/22313)  When the revolution comes, user eggybread will be the first against the wall.\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Raspberry","url":"https://redd.it/5ixiki","vendor":{"name":"Hangsen","code":"HS"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"HS","title":"Raspberry"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
