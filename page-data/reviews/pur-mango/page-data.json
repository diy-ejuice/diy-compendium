Juicy, tropical. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Flavor Description:** At a 3 day steep I taste a sweet, juicy, and very mild fleshy fruit. Slightly generic with tropical notes, if I didn't know the name I wouldn't be able to figure it out. Maybe it needs a higher strength or longer steep? After 2 weeks this has changed dramatically. It has developed into a very authentic naturally sweet and ripe mango. Not an overly ripe cloying sweetness. It's extremely refreshing and has a noticeable body with no hint of the skin. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:** None\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit:** 2/10\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Pairings:** Almost any fruit, especially banana and tropical varieties. Citrus, pineapple, ginger, vanilla, cinnamon, coconut, melon, nuts.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Notes:** This one needs a longer steep to fully develop so don't give up too early. For use as a single flavor I would recommend 5-6% for an RDA and around 7-8% for a tank. 1-4% used as an accent.\n","author":"mysticrosell","title":"Mango","url":"https://redd.it/5q99m4","vendor":{"name":"Purilum","code":"PUR"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"PUR","title":"Mango"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
