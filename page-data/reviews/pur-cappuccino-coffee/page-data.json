Slight bitterness of the coffee bean at the beginning of the inhale, followed with surprising sweetness although it seems slightly dry. It's very good, I wasn't expecting the sweetness. At the 2 week steep mark this hasn't changed drastically so it would make a good shake and vape. The slight dryness did disappear with the longer steep time, but it wasn't overly bothersome in the beginning.  The warm cream is mild and has smoothed out just slightly and it's still a robust roast with that surprising sweetness at the end. The mild bitterness/darkness of the coffee bean is also now more noticable on the beginning of the exhale as well, so overall this has become more balanced during both inhale and exhale. This is the first coffee flavor I have found that I like, actually tasting like freshly brewed coffee versus the typical instant coffee taint. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:** None, slightly dry for the first few days.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit:** 3/10\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Pairings:** Irish Cream, amaretto, brandy, creams, white and milk chocolate, butterscotch, caramel, creme de menthe, vanillas, toffee, malted milk, meringue, salted caramel, toasted marshmallow, whipped cream, cinnamon, biscotti, butter pecan, butter rum, cookies, cakes, nuts, tobaccos.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Notes:** I don't like black unsweetened coffee, this is great with the cream and sweetening coming through. I recommend 4-6% in an RDA and 6-8% in a tank for SF. Accent in the 1-3% range.","author":"mysticrosell","title":"Cappuccino Coffee","url":"https://redd.it/5q8sgg","vendor":{"name":"Purilum","code":"PUR"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"PUR","title":"Cappuccino Coffee"}},
