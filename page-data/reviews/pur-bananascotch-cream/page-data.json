    "result": {"data":{"reviewsJson":{"markdown":"**Percentage Used:** 6%\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Equipment Used:**  Troll RDA with a single Kanthal .3 ohm Staircase coil at 27W. 24g kernel with 32g wrap, cotton wick.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**PG/VG:** 30/70\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Steep Time:** 7 Days and 4 Weeks\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Aroma:** Banana cream pudding with a dark caramelized butterscotch.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Flavor Description:** Fresh ripe banana, mildly sweet cream. Not a pudding, it doesn't have the thickness or density. Has a very very light hint of creamy butterscotch. Very much like the butterscotch syrup that goes on ice cream, nothing candy like. At 4 weeks it's an authentic ripe banana. It has the creaminess you get from a fresh banana, maybe a slight hint of light cream? The balance between the butterscotch and banana is very good, with the fruit dominant drizzled with a butterscotch syrup. The butterscotch is moderately sweet, not overly sweet or dark.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:** None\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit:** 1/10\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Pairings:** Other fruits. Cookies, cakes, cereal, creams, custards, nuts, ice cream, banana split.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Notes:** Even though this isn't a cream, it did seem to become creamier after steeping. It's ok at this percentage in an RDA, but if using as a single flavor I would use 8-10% for a fuller flavor.\n\n","author":"mysticrosell","title":"Bananascotch Cream","url":"https://redd.it/6dkm4g","vendor":{"name":"Purilum","code":"PUR"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"PUR","title":"Bananascotch Cream"}},
