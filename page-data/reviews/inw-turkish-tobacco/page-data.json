Almost creamy. Like a cream soda type of sweet creaminess. Tobacco leaves in the background. Maybe some woodsy and smoky notes hiding in there as well, but not very noticeable. Reminds me a bit of Indigo's The Stuff, if my memory of that flavor serves me correctly (been about a year.)\n\n**Off-flavors:** I wasn't really expecting to taste cream soda, but it's still a good flavor. \n\n**Throat hit:** Hardly any. Smooth. Kind of thick, but not harsh. \n\n**Uses:** If a cream soda-esque tobacco sounds appealing, single flavor this shit at 5%. If you're looking for something a little more robust and dark, but with a smoothness to it, throw this in with it at around 2% and adjust from there (FLV Red Burley and INW Dark for Pipe come to mind, but I haven't experimented with it... yet.) Add some caramel and vanilla and build your own RY4. It's not what I was expecting, but it's not useless!\n\n**Pairings:** Dark tobaccos, vanillas and creams, coffee, maybe some fruits. I think it could be pretty versatile. \n\n**Notes:** I think I've covered all the notes I had on it. \n\n\n\n\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ChemicalBurnVictim","title":"Turkish Tobacco","url":"https://redd.it/5nfuiw","vendor":{"name":"Inawera","code":"INW"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"INW","title":"Turkish Tobacco"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
