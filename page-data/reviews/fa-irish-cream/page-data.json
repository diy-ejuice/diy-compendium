Moderately dense I'd give it a 4 out of 10. Slight throat hit.                   \n                \n**Flavor Properties**- This is coming off as more chocolate coffee then a cream, light on the vanilla, and cream, no perceptible almond, there is a hint of smoky whiskey flavor used at most Irish Cream.\n\n**Relatable Flavors** - This reminds me  of an Irish coffee it does have that whiskey flavor and just a little warmth.\n\n**Off Flavors** - As with most chocolates the chocolate in this is just a little chalky, and a hint of the skunky flavor you'd expect from a coffee.\n\n**Position In The Recipe** - Given its light density, and mouthfeel believe this is going to work best as an accent, or top note.\n\n**Pairings** - Other coffees, creams, bakeries, vanilla's, most dark berries should pair nicely, I would avoid any tropical fruit flavorings. Could definitely benefit from a touch of almond or hazelnut, and Burbon might also help finish out the illusion of alcohol.","author":"Chrisdvr1","title":"Irish Cream","url":"https://redd.it/4o2dlg","vendor":{"name":"Flavour Art","code":"FA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FA","title":"Irish Cream"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
