I promised /u/thedirtyprojector that I would review this flavor that was, in my opinion, the key in /u/CheebaSteeba's and my [Pumpkin Cider](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/14900#pumpkin_cider_by_cheebasteeba) recipe. I am, or at least try to be, a woman of my word so here goes.\n  \n**MY Build:**  \nDual round wire coil - .25 ohm/recoil/rx 200/75 Watts.  \n\n**Percentage Mixed:**  \nStandalone /5%/ 70/30 VG/PG  \n\n**Steep Time:**  \n2 Days: As this is a fruit, it doesn't change too much in the steep process.  \n\n**First Impresstions:**  \nSo in all honesty, my first impression of this flavor, before I even ordered it, was eeewww, yam why on earth would someone make a yam flavor and where in the world would that fit in a mix. Then I thought about sweet potato pie and how close it is to pumpkin pie and thought that this would be a good addition to something pumpkin. It being fall, I NEEDED to do something with pumpkin. I am glad I got over that first impression and decided to give it a go. It is a clear flavoring with a slightly sweet, musty smell (which didn't give me any more confidence to actually put this in a mix). Once I dropped it on the back of my hand for a lick test, I noticed it was very sweet and not as musty which made me feel a little better about trying it.  \n\n**Taste:**  \nThis flavor has really surprised me. It does not have a very potent potato-ey, flavor like you might think but what you do have is a nice, sweet, mellow, starchy, if a bit earthy, bottom note. The earthiness or mustiness is a bit spicy reminiscent of a tea. This flavor has a nice, thick, creamy mouthfeel.  \n\n**Standalone/Mixer:**  \n It is quite pleasant vaping all on its own but really shines when you use it to add complexity to a recipe. It is used in the pumpkin cider recipe to add body to the pumpkin flavor and round off the harshness the pumpkin spice has.  This flavor was the glue, I believe, in the pumpkin base of this Cider recipe. It worked so perfectly in filling out the pumpkin flavor and softening any rough edges. It gives the mix a sweet, mellow fullness I really like.  \n\n**Pairings:**  \nOk, so this took some thinking about as the only thing I could think to do with this flavor is put it in your pumpkin base for fall recipes. It is such a nice thick and sweet flavor it would probably be good with custards and other creams. There, of course, always is the aforementioned sweet potato pie; throw a little maple in there, some brown sugar and perhaps a little marshmallow and a touch of cinnamon and maybe some pecan and you have a traditional thanksgiving sweet potato casserole. I don't really think you would get a lot of use out of this flavor so a 10 ml will last you for a while.   \n\nThanks guys for reading this. I am glad I can contribute to this awesome community and I look forward to writing up more reviews as I am terribly behind on single flavor testing.
