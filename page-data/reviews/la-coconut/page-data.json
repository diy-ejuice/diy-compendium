There are very earthy, savory,  and juicy notes, along with a sweet, bright, candy type flavoring.\n\n**Relatable Flavors** \n\nThe flavoring reminds me of shredded toasted coconut, the coconut you find it a Mounds bar, and sweetened coconut milk.\n\n**Position In The Recipe** \n\nGiven its density believe it will be most useful as a base note, haven't played around with it much, but during the testing I can't imagine it being used as an accent too finish off a already complex coconut flavoring. \n\nCoconut has a tendency to take a top note position when combined with other lite flavors like cream, and if you're looking for a simple coconut stand-alone flavor this one is definitely on the list.\n\n**Off Flavors**\n\nA very slight almost imperceptible waxy taste.\n\n**Pairings** \n\nChocolates, fruits, bakeries, tobacco, candy, cream flavorings, vanilla and most spice flavorings.\n\n**Recipe** \n\nShould be a great starting point for anyone looking to experiment with this flavor.\nStill a work in progress feel free to leave feedback.\n\n https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/share/00519aaf-0126-4e5c-8579-2abb4df1f6c3\n\n\n**Notes** \n\nPleasantly surprised by this one and while searching for a recipe looks like nobody is using it, let's see if we can change that.\n\nHere is a Wikipedia on coconut candy flavoring.\n\n https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coconut_candy\n\nAnd where I got mine.\n\n http://www.bullcityvapor.com/coconut-la/\n\n**Rating** \n\n**Please if your opinion differs, or you have another review for this flavor add it in the comments.
