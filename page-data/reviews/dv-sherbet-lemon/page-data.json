Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Decadent Vapours Sherbet Lemon @ %3, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 23 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  A soft, sweet lemon flavor. A good deal like the lemon curd in a lemon meringue pie, or a lemon sorbet flavor with some cream behind it. Close to a more mellow FA Lemon Sicily mixed with the softer, waxy mouthfeel of a whipped cream. \n\nInhale is slightly harsh, warm, and almost a lemon candy flavor. Exhale starts off with bright sweet lemon curd. Lemon flavor is right down the middle with a bit of juicy roundness and without much in the way of sharper, zesty top notes.  Maybe just a hint of like a buttercream type of taste on the back half on the exhale with that same kind of distinctly waxy mouthfeel.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Nah, although that mouthfeel is straight waxy.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Moderate. Not terrible, but that lemon hits a bit rough.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  A lemon for mixing with creams, primarily. I'd use it for ice creams, sherberts, lemon frosting, or custards.  Also seriously reminiscent of a lemon curd, so bakeries like lemon meringue pie or lemon bars.  Mouthfeel won't work with drier lemon bakeries, they really need a cream or curd component.\n\nHeavier mouthfeel will be a good fit for lemon candies.\n\nToo waxy for mixing without some serious consideration for the mouthfeel here.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nCocentration testing, at 3% the flavor seems weak and a bit unsaturated.  4% is a lot more solid in flavor, and that lemon is bright while still being balanced out with the creamier element here.  Starts tasting more like a lemon drop kind of candy. 5% is super bright, and by 6% it starts to get a bit bitter and astringent.  I'd mix with this at 4% for a strong, lemon curd note either in ice cream or bakeries.\n\nA good lemon curd flavor, with some potential for candies. Lmiited utility from that waxy mouthfeel, though.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nSo, like usual, /u/HocusKrokus beat me to this one. [He posted a Crema Di Limone recipe that takes advantage of mouthfeel here that looks pretty great, especially the addition of lavender.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/recipe/1058255/Crema%20Di%20Limone)\n\n[DV's own description of this flavor is quite a bit different from what I get, they say \"A mouthwatering steam fresh on the throat with citrus top-notes with fizzy after-tones. Sweetly twisted perfection.\"](http://decadentvapours.com/shop/diy-e-liquid/flavour-concentrates/sherbert-lemon-2/)  [Chef's Flavours further ramps up it by saying there are \"notes of honey, pear, and lime.\"](https://www.chefsflavours.co.uk/dv-concentrates/2128-lemon-sherbert.html) Of course, reading that I can sort of see it, but I think lemon curd has a lot of that same kind of nuance.  What they don't mention is that waxy mouthfeel and the dairy element here. So, I guess YMMV a bit. Certainly tasty though.\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Sherbet Lemon","url":"https://redd.it/5rj667","vendor":{"name":"Decadent Vapours","code":"DV"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"DV","title":"Sherbet Lemon"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
