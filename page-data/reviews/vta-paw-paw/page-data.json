So I thought I may as well start posting my notes.*\n\n**Flavour Name:** VT Paw Paw\n\n**SFT at** 2.5% and 4% (added 1.25% to what remained in the tester bottle) 60/40, 1mg\n\n**Tested on:** Hadaly, single alien KA1, 0.55 ohms, 35w\n\n**Steeped for:** 2.5% tester - 1 day (overnight). 4% tester - SNV (although the 2.5% tester I added to had steeped overnight) and overnight and 4 days.\n\n\n**Flavour Description:** I really like this flavour. I could vape it as a SF. It's really tasty and refreshing. Fairly complex. Slightly creamy base, in a similar way to how banana is creamy, but without any banana flavour. Honeydew melon and slight cucumber -ish notes which makes it really refreshing. Has a bit of tropical funkiness and tartness, similar to that of passion fruit, that runs all the way through the vape. Not particularly sweet, but does have some nice sweetness to it. I can't really speak to authenticity as I don't think I've had paw paw before. But its natural and not candied at all. Nice juiciness. It's very flavourful and distinctive.\n\n\n**Mouthfeel/ Texture:** slight creaminess. Nice juiciness.\n\n\n**Off Notes:** nothing tastes off or sticks out. But I can't say how accurate it is to the real thing.\n\n\n**Throat Hit:** none\n\n\n**% Testing:** at 2.5% it's not as full flavoured as I'd like for a SF or if I was using it as a main note in a mix. I've used it before in a mix at 3.75% and it was bolder and had a lovely tanginess that isn't quite coming through at 2.5%.\n\nAt 4% as a SNV it's still not bold enough. I remember it being a lot more present when I used it previously. After an overnight steep it's much better, much bolder and more saturated. After 4 days it hasn't changed. I'd say 4% is about right for a SF and maybe 3.5-4% as a main note in a mix, with an overnight steep.\n\n\n**Use and Pairings:** it's very flavourful and distinctive. So it's something I'd probably want to build a recipe around. I think you could just add a couple of other flavours and get a really nice, complex tasting mix.\n\n\nI could see it easily getting muddied if used with too many other tropical fruit flavours that have that similar funkiness. It shares a lot of similarities with honeydew melon and has the same refreshing quality. So could be a different alternative to using honeydew?\n\n\nIt already has that creamy base so would probably be pretty easy to work into some sort of creamy mix. I used it in a pineapple, paw paw yoghurt recipe and it worked really well.\n\nhttps://alltheflavors.com/recipes/184123#pineapple_and_paw_paw_yoghurt_mixinvixens_by_dixxleroo\n\n**It seems to have used the photo from my recipe on ATF. Anyone know how I can keep the link but get rid of the photo?
