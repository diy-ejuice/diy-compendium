I wouldn't say it's exactly like eating plain cheesecake, but it does a pretty good job in meeting it's product description.\n\n**Off-flavors:** I'm not getting anything weird at 5%, as it tastes sweet and smooth all the way through the inhale as well as the exhale. \n\n**Throat hit:** 5/10, thick yet smooth.\n\n**Uses:**  The obvious cheesecake/fruit recipe. Thickens up a mix while adding a graham cracker/pie crust effect.  May be used to help take sharp or bitter notes out of some recipes.  I use it to thicken up and smooth out my toffee recipe.\n\n**Pairings:**  Creams, nuts, pretty much any fruits/berries.  \n\n**Notes:** Very smooth and versatile overall, plays well in almost any recipe.\n\n\nEDIT: [Link to all of our flavor reviews in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)","author":"wh1skeyk1ng","title":"Cheesecake Graham Crust","url":"https://redd.it/4o45pd","vendor":{"name":"The Flavor Apprentice","code":"TFA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"TFA","title":"Cheesecake Graham Crust"}},
