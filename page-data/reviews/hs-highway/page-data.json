I have seen other mixers crank the % up to 6 or 8% and use it standalone without it getting weird.  Personally, I think 3% is plenty though.\n\n**Pairings:**  Other tobaccos, AP, chocolate, vanilla, even some bakery flavorings would become interesting paired with this at a low %.\n\n**Notes:**   I've read that this flavor is extracted from real tobacco.  To me, it doesn't come across as an overly strong tobacco, but the other supporting notes here really make this flavor worth trying if you have the slightest interest in tobacco flavors.  To me, it is definitely a lot sweeter than others in its class.\n\n[Link to all of our flavor reviews in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)","author":"wh1skeyk1ng","title":"Highway","url":"https://redd.it/5j2ryq","vendor":{"name":"Hangsen","code":"HS"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"HS","title":"Highway"}},
