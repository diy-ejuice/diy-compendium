Some cedar notes are present. This tobacco flavor has low or no ash content, making it great to use in a flavor profile where you want a crisp tobacco note, but not the heavy ash, or spice of darker tobaccos.” I don’t personally get the nutty (maybe I’m turning in to a nutty mute?) and I do get a hint of some spice. Maybe the cedar note I’m picking up as spice. I think this makes a great base to build a Turkish Blend on. I prefer to use this with a little bit of HS Elder Captain over FLV Turkish. Their Turkish gets a bit weird for me. The tobacco in the Oriental is a crisp and bright Tobacco, not completely different than their Cured or Native. Not smoky or ashy really. It’s got some pretty nice body to it. It could probably work as a stand-alone around 2%, but I like to keep it around 1-1.5% and build on top of it. \n\n**Off flavors:** Some of the FLV tobaccos give me a weird laundromat taste when I take them too high. I don’t think this is very common, but I know that it at least happens to a guy I work with. But at 1.5% it’s not really noticeable, and I mix with it closer to 1-1.25%, and don’t pick it up in a mix. But FLV usually doesn’t require enough to bring out any of those off notes. \n\n**Pairings:** Throw Some Spices in with it. Some Fig or raisin. Goes really well with that raisin smell from a fresh pack (I use INW Fortuna Strike.) I imagine it would play nicely with some fruits. Maybe some Wood Spice if you want to exploit that cedar note and get really woodsy. \n\n**Second Opinions:** For some reason I couldn’t really find any other notes on it. Not sure why, I think it’s probably one of my favorites from FLV. Anyone got any second opinions?\n\nI suppose since there’s no second opinions and only 2 public recipes for it on ATF, I’ll throw out my [Turkish for Pipe](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/share/86979349-b73b-4899-b85f-4961bf47ce6c) recipe just to give some more ideas on how to use it. \n\n[DIY_Ejuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)","author":"ChemicalBurnVictim","title":"Oriental Tobacco","url":"https://redd.it/7f7ju7","vendor":{"name":"Flavorah","code":"FLV"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FLV","title":"Oriental Tobacco"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
