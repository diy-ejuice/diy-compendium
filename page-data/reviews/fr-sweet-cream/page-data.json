Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Flavor Revolution Sweet Cream, 1% and 3%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 34 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Moderately dense, richer vanilla whipped cream.\n\nMedium rich buttery dairy notes right up front.  These are apparently DAAP free, so it may be a function of the steep, but I'm not getting any sour or butryic type notes.  Some slightly funkier cream notes with a very light tartness, but they lean toward realism for a heavy cream as opposed to the anything vomity.  I will say, this seems like the most realistic of the creams I've tryed from Flavor Revolution so far.\n\nStill some vanilla in this one, coming in on the tail end of the exhale.  It's less pronounced than their cream and vanilla cream, playing more of an accent to those richer cream notes instead of being right up front.  Still not a deep, spicy vanilla, but maybe a moderately rich vanilla like you'd get in a cheaper vanilla pudding or custard. Still has some of that bright frosting type vanilla but he richer notes help to keep it from tasting like marshmallows.\n\nTexture is less fluffy and wispy than their Vanilla Cream, but still feels a bit more like a whipped cream rather than a flatter heavy cream flavor.  Full mouthfeel with a moderate density and just a little bit of dryness.  Pretty heavily sweetened, and with that fluffier texture and richer dairy notes reminds me more of a homemade whipped cream as opposed to the Kool Whip kind of vibe from their vanilla cream.\n\nComparing this to some of the other sweet cream flavors, I think is more in the more \"whipped cream\" realm of FW Sweet Cream as opposed to CAP or TPA sweet cream which are definitely heavier on the dairy notes.  Seems fairly similar to FW Sweet Cream, but not quite as rich.\n\n**Off-Flavors:**  More of a vanilla whipped cream than straight sweet cream.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Nah, not really.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 1%, this feels maybe a bit watery?  The texture is probably closer to a non-whipped sweet cream but the flavor is a bit weak and doesn't really feel saturated.  I think I'm still tasting some my base through this.  Vanilla doesn't stand out too much against some of the richer cream notes.\n\nAt 3% this fills more filled in.  Fairly sweet, with some buttery richness.  Texture gets just a hair dry, and it's definitely leaning towards whipped cream. Vanilla also seems pretty prominent here.\n\nJust based on these tests, I'd probably be around the suggested percentage of 2% with this as an accent flavor or cream base.  I feel like it's a bit bland under that, and taking it higher reinforces the whipped cream aspects.  If you were going to use it as a whipped cream, I'd step up to 3%.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This is pretty close in profile to both FW Sweet Cream and CAP Vanilla Whipped cream and could be used a slightly less rich sub.\n\nThis has enough body to stand up some of the more intense bakery flavors as a whipped cream layer.  Should work okay with the yellow or chocolate cakes.\n\nAnd again, good pairing with brighter fruits like strawberries, but could probably stand up to some heavier, darker berry flavors.\n\n**Second Opinions:** [There is a note up for this one on ELR.  User \"juice junkie\" writes: \"Mixed at 2% steeped a month. Using an entheon 0.3 ohms 35 watts.  This flavor reminds me of fresh cream more than a sweet cream. I do get a little bit of the sweet cream notes or bitterness that most sweet creams have. This is a decent flavor at 2%. It has really nice mouthfeel and thickness. I can imagine that if you go higher on this the bitterness of sweet cream would come through a little more.\"](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/197672)\n\n[Here is the product page from Nicotine River.
