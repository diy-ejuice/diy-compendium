I'm the worst at describing a flavor so feel free to trash the notes, disagree or suggest notes to include. I'm mostly publishing them front page because there's so little information on them here so they'd be searchable. I mixed them all up over a month ago and just never got around to testing them due to life priorities. I usually use them in an mtl tank and wasn't blown away by any of them. Tried them all this time in the c4 (adv ss claptons 0.43 at 52W) and there was a huge difference in flavor. I know there's some subtlety lost in mtl vaping but this was remarkable. I think they just deliver better in higher concentrations. Most were tested at the max suggested use and I think that's definitely where you should start if planning to vape solo, test,  or mix right off the bat. These are just my first pass private notes going public. This is not meant to be exhaustive and im not into working too hard so they're just impressions compared to how they were described by the SM website. My hope is that you get more of an idea of which ones to try if you're looking at them at all and willing to deal with the price and rewicking.\n\n**Overall impression**: The flavors are very different from INW or FLV baccos im more familiar with. They are expensive and not cost efficient at all. These are for the tobacco lover who wants a very 'clean' flavored tobacco juice. There was almost no ash in any of them I could really taste but a few gave the 'impression' of ashiness by being bolder or darker. i think all of them could be paired with just about anything since they're so clean, but because they are relatively less aggressive in general, i'd lean towards lighter or less aggressive pairings. Fruits, accents, etc. Also they are all very sweet in general so I can see all of them leaning into an ry2-5 profile with ease.\n\nOn the whole, they lack off notes (and probably on notes too if used too low), unless you consider the natural sweetness an off note. It feels that way sometimes.\n\nRecipes on atf are lacking but there's a bunch on [ELR](https://e-liquid-recipes.com/list?q=Stixx+Mixx).\n\n# Flavors\n\n**SM American Virginian - 12% slightly sweet american styled cigarette.**\n\n*SM: The perfect base note to your tobacco creations. Smooth, Medium to bold American cigarette, full bodied, slightly sweet, red type, Thick mouth feel, (0 to trace) out of (10) throat hit. Use @ 8% Preferred single flavor mix at 10-12%*\n\nI feel this has a medium body and is very sweet. Im guessing 'red type' means marlboro styled? Maybe. What do I know? I disagree about the mouthfeel. It lacks a little body like so many other SM NETs. Sort of plain cigarette flavor with hints of dark fruit like raisin. This could be a good base to mid note for a cigarette. I'd want some more flavor, mixed with something that had some accent notes, maybe a fruit to pair with the sweetness? Definitely want something to fill it out some more.\n\nrelatable flavors: like a sweeter lighter HS ry1?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Havana Primed - 6% Cigar styled aroma**\n\n*SM: A fuller rich cigar, like a big stogie. Very smooth light leaf wrapper with a nice filler.  Stands wonderfully by itself, still the light leaf wrapper but the boldness of the filler comes through. Recommend 2 week steep. Use @ 4-6%*\n\nMe: Sweet cigar stlyed tobacco. Body and a hint of wrapper. I'm not getting any chocolate notes, no coffee notes. I guess my standard is Flv CT shade which is a firggin bully. This is definitely full bodied and smooth at 6%. Not deep either. Not sure i'd vape this as a stand alone. Leaves me wanting more bottom notes to make it more realistic cigar. Something to anchor it down. Maybe add some dnb to make it more realistic?\n\nRecipe: sole atf [https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/47803#vanilla\\_tobacco\\_by\\_sixstrings952](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/47803#vanilla_tobacco_by_sixstrings952)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Whiskey Cavendish - 10% Tobacco Blend with a Whiskey flavoring**\n\n*SM: Whiskey Cavendish is a mixture of Burley, Virginia and Black Cavendish tobaccos with an outstanding whiskey flavoring recipe to achieve a remarkable flavor and aroma – mellow but satisfying. Use @ 8-10%*\n\nMe: finally a complex flavor. I like this one, I can taste the whiskey in it but it's a slightly sweet flavor more than a boozy note. This works as a complex stand alone. There;s lots to this aroma. The bacco blend hits all the points i like. I think this works as a stand alone and shows what can be done with these flavors and the right blend/mix.\n\nRelatable flavors: Much less bold The Southerner. Like a southerner one shot lite.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Aged Burley - 10%**\n\n*SM: A mid to full bodied smoke. When mixed in with a lighter shag, it brings out the manly back notes that you may desire. Earthy, nice throat hit. Use @ 6-10%*\n\nMe: great smell off this one before i even tried it. Slight nutty taste and only a hint of sweet. I like the body on this one, full and low. It could stand as the main note in a mix. Definitely not kidding about the throat hit. It feels like just the right mid-base note, but not as in your face as the FLV version. perhaps they are right about the 'manly back notes' (is that hairiness?). I'd maybe pair this with sweet brightleaf? If you are used to Flv Red Burley, this is a much more mellow nuttiness yet also an as distinct flavor. If you are tired of flv RB then I'd get this one.\n\nRelatable flavors: Much less bold Flv Red burley.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Brazilian Viso - 10%**\n\n*SM: A nice dry, not sweet shag. In the medium range it can provide body to many a mix. Use as a filler with some Nicaraguan Seco or Burley. Steep minimum of 2 weeks for full flavor. Use @ 6-8% standalone @ 10%*\n\nMe: Noticeably less sweet than the rest. Maybe not necessarily in a good way but I could see this being added to one of the sweeter ones to bring it down a notch. Has a nice woody flavor that is very different from the rest. rather enjoyable on it's own and I could see this being the 'cured for body' fix for the NET range at 4-6%. At 10% it doesnt seem to hold up to the complexity of the WC or HP. Not sure how much filler burley needs. I'd like to pair it with something that will play well with the woody notes. American Virginian or the Burley perhaps?\n\nRelatable flavors: Hints of woody like Vanilla for pipe but without the vanilla/pipe-y muskiness. And not as strong; just a hint. Definitely more of a cig type.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Supreme - 6% Tobacco Blend**\n\nSM: *A nice combination of three different shags….Nicaraguan Ligero Filler,Connecticut Broadleaf Binder,and Havana Wrapper. For a bold and smooth taste! Use @ 6-10%*\n\nMe: Tried this at the lower end for once. Big Mistake, meaning I just want more. Surprisingly the flavor is there but im not picking up the flavor like the other samples and i regret it because this has a very good flavor as a stand alone. This one is complex enough to be vaped solo. Only a hint of sweet, the combination flavor here is working to make a nice well rounded tobacco. At 6, it’s not failing to deliver the flavor, I just can’t get behind it this low, despite it being dark and rich.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Wild strawberry Tea - 8% Green tea w/SB**\n\nSM: Japanese Sencha green tea with a refreshing strawberry and papaya. Recommended at 4-8%\n\nMe: at 8% this delivers a powerful SB flavor. Slightly floral with a decent throat hit, it’s sweet with a little bit of green from the tea, a nice match. Not a green like a stem from a strawberry, but just adding to the fullness of the flavor. It’s a nice complement. Not sure im picking up on the papaya at all. Sweet almost powdery sugar. I might add some SB flavoring to this to round it out a bit if i wanted a fuller SB but it works here solo. The tea is not very pronounced and low in the background as that slight green, not astringent, just a hint. I dont think I would mess with this too much. Maybe just something to boost the tea notes or fill out the berry? Maybe just use this in place of SB in some regular recipes since I am not crazy for the SB sweets. Definitely worth the test.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion**: The Supreme or Whiskey Cavendish if you want an all-in-one flavor good to go. Overall, not nearly as good in mtl imo; the subtlety that makes them so smooth and fun to vape is lost. Not really cost effective but for the tobacco lovers, they are worth a try and really interesting to vape. I find that when I switch back over to the flv/inw mixes i have, I feel they are clumsy and overbearing at first by comparison to the SM flavors. As a general statement, they were all pretty sweet so if that's a problem, go Brazilian Viso for sure for a less sweet cig style. The tea was an interesting vape more for the SB flavor (which isn't really my passion) and seemed so forward compared to any combination of SB i've ever had.
