Smooth through the nose and lungs. Slight creamy mouth feel.\n\n**Flavor Properties**- Nutty, almost earthy with a creamy back note.\n\n**Relatable Flavors** - Doesn't really taste like any macadamia nut I've had. It's obviously not unsalted, it has some sweetness to it (not honey) but it just tastes very off.\n\n**Off Flavors** - There is a strong aftertaste on the exhale. I'm not sure if its just me but I can discern the taste even after using it in one of my mixes. It almost tastes burnt, like when you leave bread inside a toaster for a minute too long, and you can't shake off the taste even after scraping the black edges.\n\n**Position In The Recipe** - This will probably work as an accent note. I can't see it being a base note just because of the color (its black as tar) and the odd chemical taste.\n\n**Pairings** - In small amounts, you could probably use this in some trail mix recipe or honey roasted nuts. Although again, I don't know anyone who would find this taste appealing.\n\n**End notes** - In my humble opinion, you can ignore this flavor. It's not a good macadamia flavoring, it's not a good flavoring, period. Because of the color alone, it will fuck up your coils in a day or two. And it leaves a super unpleasant exhale taste which I just can't see working anywhere... Someone just posted that this contains corn syrup (which is unsafe to vape), avoid at all costs.","author":"thedirtyprojector","title":"Macadamia Nut","url":"https://redd.it/4onpra","vendor":{"name":"Flavor West","code":"FW"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FW","title":"Macadamia Nut"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
