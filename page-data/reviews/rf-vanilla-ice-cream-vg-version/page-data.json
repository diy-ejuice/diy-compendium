    "result": {"data":{"reviewsJson":{"markdown":"**Percentage Used:** 12%\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Equipment Used:**  Troll RDA with a SS Dragon Nano coil .46ohm at 25W\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**PG/VG:** 30/70\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Steep Time:** 4 Weeks\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Aroma:** Vanilla, cream, sugar.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Flavor Description:** Thick and creamy pure vanilla ice cream. I couldn't detect any sharpness or peppery tones of vanilla bean. Moderately sweet, although I'm not sure how much of that is from the flavoring or the VG it's suspended in. It's probably from a combination of both. This has a creamy mouth feel with a slight thickness on the tongue. This is such a well rounded vanilla, it would be wonderful used in any recipe where you are looking for sweet creamy vanilla. The ice cream aspect is light enough that it might be hidden behind other flavors in a mix, just leaving the thick creamy vanilla. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:** None\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit:** 2/10\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Pairings:** Almost any fruit, particularly berries or for fruit smoothies or cocktails. Cookies, cakes, creams, custards, nuts, tobaccos, pies, cinnamon, butter pecan, caramel, butterscotch, mint, chocolate chip, creme de menthe, any ice cream combination, Koolada or menthol. Anywhere you want creamy vanilla.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Notes:** Good moderate strength at 12% for a SF. If you like a more in your face flavor I would go for 15-17% SF. I will have to experiment with it in mixes, I'll probably start around 3-8%. A very versatile flavor with a lot of uses. Based on my other testing of RF flavors, I'm sure the thickness and creaminess will continue to develop, usually with the best results at 8 weeks or more.","author":"mysticrosell","title":"Vanilla Ice Cream VG Version","url":"https://redd.it/5n3w5k","vendor":{"name":"Real Flavors","code":"RF"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"RF","title":"Vanilla Ice Cream VG Version"}},
