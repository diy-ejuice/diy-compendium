But 3% DNB is way high and will probably not appeal to most.\n- INW DNB and FA Black Fire are cousins and do share similarities.\n- INW DNB has some smoke to it but really adds that acrid ashy note which kicks in about halfway through a smoking a cigarette. It also has zero sweetness. Black Fire is smoke but no ash tray taste and it has a slight sweetness.\n- They can certainly be used together, low in the mix, to get you as close to burning tobacco as possible.\n- If I had to choose only 1, I would go with Dirty Neutral Base\n- I went in hard at 3%, it was uncalled for, I regret nothing.","author":"T_Mace","title":"Dirty Neutral Base (DNB)","url":"https://redd.it/670w5w","vendor":{"name":"Hangsen","code":"HS"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"HS","title":"Dirty Neutral Base (DNB)"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
