Not a lot of crust present.  \nNot bad, but it's more like FLV Apple Filling at this point.\n\n**3 Day steep:** the crust is now way more upfront, the cinamon and the apple are far less present.  \nBit empty, no real body in here\n\n**5 Day steep:** It's starting to come together now. The apple, cinnamon and crust are more balanced.   \nLike all SSA flavors, this is another steeper.\n\n**7 Day steep:** Very nice balance of apple, cinnamon and crust.   \nIt did however fade a bit, so 3% might be a little low for this one. Or just fill it out with some FLV Apple Filling and some crust. All in all, good flavor!\n\n**Offnotes:** none\n\n**Sidenotes:** needs help, it's not a one shot, but it is pretty close","author":"TBX-12","title":"Apple Strudel","url":"https://redd.it/jmno2c","vendor":{"name":"Sobucky Super Aromas","code":"SSA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"SSA","title":"Apple Strudel"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
