And it is its so so so nice.  \n\nIf I'm honest I love peaches but I can't recall ever having a white peach. Peach however yeah I've had loads I love em but this white peach flavour is on par with a peach if anything I find it not as Juicy or sweet as peach but either way it's fantastic.  \n\nAgain FA have produced a winner here spot on in accuracy, it's semi sweet, fresh and ripe and absolutely no harshness at all.  \n\nI can't say much more really just go and get some it's a must.  \n\nCreate the perfect peach with Fa white peach and Fa peach  \n\nSo play around its going to work in bakeries, diaries, desserts, beverages and other delicate fruits\n\n**Notes**  \n\nReal,fresh,ripe,sweet,versatile  \n\nStandalone 2-3%  \nIn a recipe0.5-2.5%  \n\n*Please if your opinion differs, or you have another review for this post it in the comments.
