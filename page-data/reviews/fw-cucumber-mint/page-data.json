I think the mint could be stronger but it is a very nice refreshing flavor. You get the flesh and the skin of the cucumber at this percentage and a nice leafy spearmint.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Very clean flavor with nothing out of the ordinary\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Very light throat hit but nothing like you would think of with mint\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This would be good to freshen up a fruit mix or add a twist to cocktail recipes. I am definitely thinking of mojitos. This flavor would add a unique twist to a lot of lighter mixes. I would not use this in heavy fruits or creams or bakeries. It is very light and refreshing you want to keep it light.\n\n**Notes:**\nI have only vaped it at 4% but it is a very full albeit light flavor. That may sound confusing but I don't know how else to describe it. The cucumber has come out quite a bit in the steep so expect it to be more mint heavy right away. \n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nThere is no mention of this flavor except a couple percentages on elr but no notes. \n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**\n\nIf you have different opinions on the flavor or any ideas on how to use it please post them in the comments.
