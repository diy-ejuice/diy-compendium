Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Berry Blend @ 1%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 8 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Jammy and sweet berry mix, tastes a lot like FLV Boysenberry with some added higher raspberry notes.  Flavorah describes it as a \" juicy berry punch\" and their product picture has some raspberry, blueberry, and what looks like a blackberry. Seems pretty close. Good amount of realistic berry tartness and manages to avoid tasting too medicinal or like a generic mixed berry candy flavor.\n\nInhale is sweet, dense, and a bit warm. Some good raspberry tartness there. Exhale has brighter raspberry up front with a pretty light floral character. Thicker, darker berry base.  Sweet, jammy, and dense. Mouthfeel is a bit sticky.  Tart, slightly green blueberry on the tail end of the exhale.  Fairly clean, just a lingering sweetness.\n\n**Off Flavors:** Not really.  Nothing too sharp, green, or just plain off here. Pretty good balance overall. A little warm and \"red\" but doesn't have that pronounced medicinal, woody, camphor kind of note like TFA Berry Mix.  Pretty solidly on the jammy, as opposed to fresh, side of things.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Light. Nothing weird but you can feel it's there.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  It's actually a pretty good jammy berry mix.  I'd use it as a jammy bakery filling. Has a lot of the sweetness, jamminess, and a bit of the warmth needed for fillings in pies, cobblers, donuts, etc...\n\nA little indistinct and sweet for use as a primary note in a fruit mix. Would work well to bring in background sweetness and volume in a mix with a more dominant berry up front.\n\nA bit sticky and sweet for cream blends.  That jamminess and sticky mouthfeel is pronounced enough it may mess with the mouthfeel of more delicate creams.  Might work for something like a berry swirl in a heavier ice cream flavor, where you'd still want some of that mouthfeel.\n\n**Notes:**  S&V concentration testing, this doesn't seem to be one of the crazy strong Flavorah flavors. A bit too thin and weak at .25 and .5%.  Good sweetness, but the berry flavor is kind of muddy and soft.  Fairly full flavor at 1%, really starting to get that jammy mouthfeel.  2% is pretty good, fruit is brighter and sweeter but it's getting a slightly candy edge to it. 3% is getting a bit sharp and I'm getting more florals off the berries. 4% seems like the useful ceiling here.  A bit too floral for me up there, with a really intense sweetness.  I'd recommend starting at 1% and working up for anything but a bakery filling.  For those jammy fillings, you'd probably be safe starting at 2% and working up.\n\nPutting this in context of the couple of other berry mixes I've tried, this seems to have a pretty unique place.  TFA Berry Mix (and based on the descriptions I've read CAP Harvest Berry) lean pretty heavily toward red, medicinal, and woody.  FA Forest mix is a slightly darker flavor, with a lot more realistic and fresh edge.  This tastes a bit more cooked and sweetened than either.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nAlmost nothing I can find.\n\n[Here's the Flavorah product page. Description is: \"Juicy berry punch, in high concentrations it goes towards berry jam. Can be stand alone, but benefits from mixing with other notes in our opinion.\"](http://store.flavorah.com/concentrated-berry-blend-flavor)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Berry Blend","url":"https://redd.it/62r9l8","vendor":{"name":"Flavorah","code":"FLV"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FLV","title":"Berry Blend"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
