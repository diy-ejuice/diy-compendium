It’s a richer dark vanilla, and standalone in slightly higher than normal percentages it’s quite like a true Vanilla Ice Cream. No off buttery tones like the others. I’ll start with notes from 1%-4% which is my suggested range officially.\n\n1% In the additive range, what you get is something similar to FA Vanilla Classic, only a bit deeper. A touch of spice like freshly cracked vanilla beans, along with the creamier vanilla notes, but very little creaminess. This makes it a great choice to boost your vanilla in an existing recipe, or just to add a little zing to your bakeries.\n\n2% The creaminess starts to step up here, becoming somewhat milky but not dense like a heavier custard. In this range it’s able to stand up to just about anything in a mix, and will stand out against even the biggest bully flavors. That cracked bean spice flavor is still present, but it’s less a spicy note and more a deeper vanilla like a bit of vanilla extract in a glass of milk.\n\n3% My preferred standalone usage for ages. The creaminess really takes on some serious body here. The spicy notes come back from where they were at 1% and stand right out against a dark vanilla cream. Still not at all eggy or buttery like most other vanilla creams we have available. It starts picking up some very malty tones here, not at all unpleasant though some may not care for it.\n\n4% For the bold, this range really cranks up the vanilla and the creams are intense. I loved it at this percentage, but for me I end up getting olfactory fatigue very quickly so I’m unable to vape it at this percentage for very long, as I’m often incapable of tasting it after a few drippers full. The malty tones become more present here as well.\n\nHoly vanilla is a forgiving steeper, and is often ready long before it’s heavy custard counterparts. 3-7 days depending on preference and it’s counterparts in a finished recipe.\n\nMy very absolute favorite usage of Holy Vanilla is with florals. For anyone who likes floral types like I do, this vanilla is bold enough to work alongside any floral flavor and stand out without taking away from your more delicate flavors. Anyone who’s spent any time trying to balance floral flavors knows it’s an incredible challenge getting consistent results when working with pairing florals. Holy Vanilla changed the way I approach florals and other delicate flavors.\n\nIn closing: Holy Vanilla - More flexible than your favorite stripper, and it doesn't sneak the last of your money out of your pocket after you visit with it. Buy it and thank /u/tranceinate later.\n\nEdit:\n\nSecond Opinion [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/4tm07w/holy_vanilla_diy_flavor_shack/) by /u/Chrisdvr1","author":"HocusKrokus","title":"Holy Vanilla","url":"https://redd.it/5krwcz","vendor":{"name":"DIY Flavor Shack","code":"DIYFS"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"DIYFS","title":"Holy Vanilla"}},
