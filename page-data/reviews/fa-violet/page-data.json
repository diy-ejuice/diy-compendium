Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FA Violet @ %1, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 39 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  A sort of chalky violet candy. Kind of flat and floral without any green or vegetal notes. A dry, fragrant floral.\n\nInhale has a softer, violet candy kind of floral note. Relative thin, mostly just top notes without a lot of sweetness.  Exhale has a chalky kind of flat base, but those violet top notes pretty on point. Again, nothing that really reads as sweetness, but the chalkyness keeps it from reading as full perfume.  Top notes linger quite a bit and turn bitter way towards the end of the exhale.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Nah, not really. It's a bit chalky and dry, but shouldn't be a huge issue if you account for it in a mix.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Light, mostly from the dryness but a tiny bit of an citrus zest kind of hit without any real citrus flavor.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Good floral for pairing with creams. The slight chalkiness and lack of green flavor is going to mix really well with some actual body. I'd even put it forward as the floral to mix with really heavy creams and custards if you want to go that route.\n\nI also like this low with brighter citruses, like oranges and tangerines.  Works well with limes, but you'll want something without a ton of zest.  I also like it with spearmint, or vanilla. [INW did the vanilla / violet pairing really well with Purple Rain.](https://redd.it/5kco2j)\n\nI have no personal experience with violet candies, but that seems to be a common recommendation. I think the chalkyness here is going to lend itself to a pastille.\n\n[I found a pretty great blog post about pairing violet that has a lot of ideas that should translate fairly well into vape form.](http://munchingmanuscript.blogspot.com/2010/09/pairing-violet-withstanding-mfk-fishers.html)\n\n**Notes:**  S&V concentration testing, this is weird and bit finicky. I get fairly strong top notes at .25 and .5% but just some raw vg taste like it isn't a fully saturated flavor. .75% is probably the sweet spot, where you get a clear violet but not a lot of weirdness. At 1% starts getting a bit dry and sharp, with a subtle, almost citrus zest kind of punch.  1.5% is getting a touch chalky.  And by 2% I feel like it's almost powdery.  Honestly, I'd keep this low and probably start at .25% and work up to maybe .75% for a primary note.  The lack of base saturation shouldn't be an issue in more complex mixes if you just want to use a touch for an accent flavor.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nNot a lot out there from the usual suspects.\n\n[Thread from VU about turning this into a violet candy.](http://vapingunderground.com/threads/parma-violets.7964/)\n\n[Not a lot of notes on ELR, but some really cool looking recipes.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/5432)\n\n[Good reviews on ECX, along with another Violet candy mention.](http://www.ecigexpress.com/diy-e-liquid/browse-flavorings/herb-spice-flavors/violet-by-flavourart.html)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Violet","url":"https://redd.it/5uop2a","vendor":{"name":"Flavour Art","code":"FA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FA","title":"Violet"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
