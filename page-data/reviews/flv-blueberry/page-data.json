Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Blueberry @ 3%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 11 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Dark, syrupy and artificial without tasting chemical. Tastes more like a desaturated grape flavor, rather than blueberry.  Not quite sweet enough solo for a candy flavor, although the \"blueberry\" flavor here definitely goes in that direction.  Reminds me of a less sweet blueberry/huckleberry/dark berry syrup flavor you'd find on pancakes at a bad chain breakfast place (shoutout to IHOP.)\n\nInahle is dark and syrupy with a moderate sweetness. Exhale is lightly sweet, soft artifical blueberry/grape or mixed dark berries flavor.  Hard to describe this flavor. If FLV Lime tastes green, and blue raspberry tastes blue, then this is a kind of a a light magenta or muave flavor.  Clean exhale with most of your flavor loaded toward the front end.  Light perfumey notes show up with higher heat and at higher concentrations.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  This tastes nothing like an actual blueberry, but it isn't harsh or chemical.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light, deep in the throat on the exhale.\n\n**Uses:** Pretty solid approximation of a commercial \"blueberry\" flavor.  Not realistic enough for actual fruit mixes as a solo blueberry.  I'd call it a cooked sweetened blueberry filling for bakeries, especially if you want to duplicate something mass-market as opposed to homemade. Candy blueberry.\n\n**Pairings:**  Low percentage of FA Bilberry for some more realistic blueberry notes. Soft enough flavor to mix well with creams and custards. Low percentage of Lemon Sicily or sweet citrus to punch up the flavor. Candy texturizers like CAP Jelly Candy or FW Hard Candy. Other sweeter berries like Raspberry or Strawberry if you want a full \"mixed berry\" flavor.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nI'm finding this a little weak for flavorah. 3% seems like the minimum you'd want to mix to get any kind of definition from this.  Narrow band of usefulness.  It's indistinct under 3%, and too perfumey over 6%.\n\nNot something I'd seek out.  Less harsh than something like TFA Blueberry Extra, but really has nothing realistic going on. Nothing soapy, earthy, or particulary interesting like a real blueberry here.\n\nShoutout to /u/apexified for sending this my way for review.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Deleted user's quick take on flavor, says blueberry hard candy.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/3208pj/my_flv_tasting_notes_blueberry/)\n\n[A couple of decent, non-duplicate notes down near the end on ELR](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/34359)\n\n[Some flavorah talk on ECF.  Consensus is that blueberry seems to be a candy flavor](https://www.e-cigarette-forum.com/forum/threads/anybody-else-tried-flavorah-flavorings-why-not-do-it.665149/)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Blueberry","url":"https://redd.it/5hs4bd","vendor":{"name":"Flavorah","code":"FLV"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FLV","title":"Blueberry"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
