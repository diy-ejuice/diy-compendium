This flavour makes for a great ice cream base to develop the foundation of many e-liquid recipes. Use it sweeten whilst maintaining creaminess or simply mix it as a standalone. If you like ice-cream and toffee then you will enjoy working with this fantastic unique flavour.\"\n\n**Results** Fresh: on back of hand creamy buttery toffee. When vaped some light toffee notes are all that is present. Week 1: Some creaminess coming through. Toffee and butteriness getting fuller. Week 2: Seems full flavored since there wasn't any change in taste from week 2 to week 3. Its definitely creamy, toffee forward with some butteriness. Not getting much vanilla. Didn't get any harshness or off notes. 6% seemed like a good spot for me. So i didn't see the need to take it higher or lower. Could be used in a recipe anywhere from 1-5% depending on how much creamy toffee you are looking for.\n","author":"ebc88","title":"Toffee Ice Cream","url":"https://redd.it/871sjk","vendor":{"name":"Vape Train Australia","code":"VTA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"VTA","title":"Toffee Ice Cream"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
