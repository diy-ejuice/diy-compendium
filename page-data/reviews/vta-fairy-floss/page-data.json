Nothing juicy at all, almost dry but not in a harsh way. Has a slight strawberry feel with hints of very very light vanilla. \n\nI love cotton candy and most cotton candy flavours I've tried have mostly been just dull and boring. Or rather be used as emulsifiers than a flavour in a recipe. \n\nThis one is rather interesting and fun instead. It's very pleasant. It doesn't make me super thirsty nor does it make me experience olfactory fatigue in 10 drags. \n\nI do find all of the cotton candy variants behave differently after steeping with other flavours in them so also mixed it with VTA's Forest Mixed Berries @ 2%. Very yummy. Like mixed berry cotton candy. Delicious.\n\n**Verdict**: Delicious. Grab it if you enjoy cotton candy. It's not that emulsifying an emulsifier, but rather a good thing to mix it with. \n\nComplimentary recipe:\n\n2% VTA Forest Mixed Berries\n\n1% VTA Fairy Floss","author":"RoninVX","title":"Fairy Floss","url":"https://redd.it/qcuvgo","vendor":{"name":"Vape Train Australia","code":"VTA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"VTA","title":"Fairy Floss"}},
