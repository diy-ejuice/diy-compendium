It's definitely not a true fruit flavor but more of a candy flavor with out much sweetness or tartness. It gets sweeter after steeping but as a shake and vape it has a pretty nice candyish blue raspberry. More like an off-Brand blue raspberry candy just a bit bland even at 15%. Any higher it starts to taste a bit funny.\n\nOff flavors- there's not a real noticeable off flavor but at high percentages and has the ever so slightest soapy chemical taste, but not enough to not make it a great flavor \n\nThroat hit- 4/10 it's a very smooth vape. May be because it's 66% VG but even at 70/30 6mg it's very smooth but with a minimal throat hit compared to other juices.\n\nPairings: this flavor is excellent with sour around 3% Sweetner 2% and sometimes I'll had 1% - 1.5% hard candy. A few others that go really well is Blue raspberry FW at around 3% even though the FW isn't good by itself, it adds a bit of the missing part of OSDIY blue raspberry. Strawberry Ripe 4% and peach 3% add a tremendously delicious twist to it while adding sweetness and a natural fruit flavor.\n\nNotes- overall this is probably the best Blue raspberry concentrate on the market. It has a lot of uses and just about any fruit flavor pairs well with it. If you're a fruit or candy lover like me and haven't tried this out, you definitely should. If it had more of a hard candy with a more tart and sweet flavor this would be perfect, though we can always add those :) next blue raspberry on my list is sour blue raspberry candy from wonder flavours. I've heard good reviews on it, just waiting for gremlin to get their shipment of them. Thanks for reading I hope this helped someone wanting a blue raspberry flavor \n\nSecond opinions- https://m.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/4zizno/first_time_buying_from_osdiy_review/?ref=search_posts","author":"tylurnt1","title":"Blue Raspberry Slush","url":"https://redd.it/5grjam","vendor":{"name":"One Stop DIY","code":"OSDIY"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"OSDIY","title":"Blue Raspberry Slush"}},
