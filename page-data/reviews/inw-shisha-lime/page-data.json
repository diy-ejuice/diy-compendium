I get natural lime, creamy sherbet lime, and lime syrup from this. I don't know how they did it but i could see this working in all sorts of recipes. IMO this is better than FA Florida Key Lime, perhaps stronger flavor. Very round, full flavor from this. I really like it. Not as candy as Shisha Lemon either, definitely much more natural, but not quite like biting into a lime, more like drinking a virgin margarita, with the same creamy ice type feel i get from Shisha Lemon, but much more forgiving.\n\nOff-flavors: None.\n\nThroat Hit: not noticeable to me.\n\nUses and Pairings: I could definitely see this in a lot of bakeries, you could add some cream fresh and  make it an excellent lemon sherbet, or maybe add some booze for a nice grown up beverage. I may experiment with making a key lime pie with this, but supposedly key lime is noticeably different than regular lime, and I don't have the tasting range to tell the difference, so other people might think it's not right. This isn't a sickeningly sweet syrup flavor, but i could see this working as   the main lime in a cherry-lime slush. I definitely recommend you pick up this flavor though, it's not a must have but i do think it's very good.\n\nSecond Opinions: couldn't really find any good reviews, but it has 4.5 stars on ELR, so i guess i'm not off in saying it's great.","author":"[deleted]","title":"Shisha Lime","url":"https://redd.it/6ityto","vendor":{"name":"Inawera","code":"INW"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"INW","title":"Shisha Lime"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
