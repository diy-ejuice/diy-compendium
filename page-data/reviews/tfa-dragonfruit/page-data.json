Seems kind of candied without being overly sugary.  I can't compare this to an actual dragonfruit, but to me, it is reminiscent of the cherry in RF Cherry Pie without the throat hit.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  None noticed\n\n**Throat hit:** 3/10 \n\n**Uses:**  This flavoring makes an excellent emulsifier due to its high triethyl citrate content.  Helps blend apple + cinnamon or blends multiple fruits together.  Also good around 1% for accenting single fruit like strawberry or watermelon.  \n\n**Pairings:** Almost any recipe with another fruit (or multiple fruits) in it.  \n\n**Notes:**   Again, due to it's emulsifying properties, this is a fairly versatile flavor especially in fruit recipes.  It isn't overly strong as a 3% standalone, but you can definitely tell a difference if you throw it in a mix at a lower %.  \n\nSorry for saying fruit so many times.  \n\nEDIT: [Link to all of our flavor reviews in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)","author":"wh1skeyk1ng","title":"Dragonfruit","url":"https://redd.it/4q74bb","vendor":{"name":"The Flavor Apprentice","code":"TFA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"TFA","title":"Dragonfruit"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
