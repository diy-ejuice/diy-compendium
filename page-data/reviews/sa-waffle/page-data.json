Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Solubarome Waffle @ 1.5 and 4.5%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 13 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  A slightly dirty waffle cone.  Crispy, dry, and sweet with that kind of toasted meringue and vanilla note you get from waffle cones specifically. No butter or syrup notes, which is a good thing.  Some earthyness in the griddled note, but it's not terrible I guess. A little dry for a solo waffle.   This seems dry enough to point where I'd be a little hesitant to throw more at this to dry to make a full waffle unless you went full batter or dough.  Without the help, it should work for a ice cream cone or maybe a dry, thin crunchy wafer note. Seems to come into it's own around 3%.  Too dry to really do a primary note.\n\nInhale is dry and sweet with an almost meringue like taste. Vanilla top notes and a dry waffle ice cream cone kind of grain to it. I can't really get past the initial flavor on the inhale, as it's dry to the point where it's difficult to actually take a deep inhale.  Exhale has that toasted meringue flavor waffle-ocity. No real dough of batter to it, more a dry crispy note.  Some bakery vanilla in the top notes. There's an earthy note there on the back half of the exhale that's maybe supposed to be bringing in a toasted flavor or griddled note that largely works but it tastes just a bit dirty.  Fairly sweet, but it's a really dry sweetness.  Some dry harshness here. Finishes fairly clean except for that dry thing.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Light earthiness to the griddled note. Also I think that dryness counts as an off-note.\n \n**Throat Hit:**  Really dry solo, to the point of being a bit difficult to vape.  Also some traditional dryness.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This already tastes like a waffle cone, why fight it? Seems like a pretty good pairing with ice creams for a cone note. I think really buttery or heavy creams are going to kind of seep into this, so you may want to stick something a little closer to soft-serve. \n\nI also think this will do a pretty bang-up job emulating wafer cookies. It already has the dry crispy vanilla thing going on.\n\n**Notes:**  Hard to really find a sweet spot here. At 1% this feels a bit thin and disjointed, with that earthy note seeming pretty prominent. 2% is a little more put together. Flavor is cohering a bit more, but it's still just a bit overbearingly earthy without that sweeter waffle really balancing it out. 3% is getting pretty dry, but it feels like a full flavor. Definitely a waffle cone here. 4% is even dryer. Waffle cone flavor is a bit clearer but that dryness is a drag. 5% is a sweet, dry desert. I'd recommend using this at 3%.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nUh, not really that I can find.\n\n[Here's the product page from Solubarome.
