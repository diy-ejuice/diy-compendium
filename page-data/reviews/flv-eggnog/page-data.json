Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Eggnog @ 3%, 70/30 VG/PG, Steeped 2 weeks.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Moderate mouthfeel. Spice-forward but not spice-heavy.  Light realistic cinnamon and a solid nutmeg. Subtle egginess.  Not necessarily a dairy creaminess, but a rich sticky note.  Sweetness is dead on.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Nope.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  4/10.  The spice note is a tad harsh solo.\n\n**Uses:**  Good base for an eggnog mix.  What this lacks in thickness can be easily fixed with a heavy cream or custard.  Rich eggy notes and nutmeg-forward spice mix would work well with bakeries.  Pumpkin pie jumps out too.\n\n**Pairings:**  Booze booze booze booze. FLV Bourbon, FA Whisky, FA Jamaican Rum.  FLV Cream, FA Cream Fresh for extra body and creaminess.  CAP Vanilla Custard for added egginess and richness. Dark, jammy fruits. Tobacco, nuts, etc. \n\n**Notes:** So, I know /u/skiddlzninja/ is between weeks on his testing of this on INTHEMIX, so I'd wait for his take on thursday. This is going up for a second opinion / posterity.\n\nUnlike something like [FLV Marshmallow Treat](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/5bngq9/flv_marshmallow_treat/) this would work really well as the basis of a mix, even though I would reinforce the egginess, creaminess, and add some booze. The spice mix here is the star, and would be an awesome bridge between even heavier ingredients and some booze.  When I think eggnog I think basically a melted frozen custard with enough alcohol to make social interactions tolerable.  This doesn't get you there all the way, but it's a good jumping off point.\n\n[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Eggnog","url":"https://redd.it/5bulw0","vendor":{"name":"Flavorah","code":"FLV"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FLV","title":"Eggnog"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
