Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** OSDIY Choco-Yum Cake @ 4% and 8%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 14 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Yeah, it's pretty much chocolate cake.  Somewhere between box-mix cake and a hostess ding-dong without a cream filling.  Strange bit of fruitiness and a bit of medicinal note in the middle of this, but it's actually pretty solid. A little hard to vape solo, seems to have some chest tightness attached. Needs around 8% to really come together, and I'd use it as a primary flavor and accent around it.  Decently strong chocolate flavor but doesn't appear to have an excessive amount of wick or coil gore attached.\n\nInhale is kind of like inhaling duncan-hines style box chocolate cake mix, although not quite as dry as that would imply.  Still on the dry side, but only kind of chalky. Really flat milk chocolate, without too much in the way of cocoa. Medium sweetness, pretty on point for a boxed cake. Exhale has that chocolate cake up front. Not a great chocolate cake, but still recognizable. Kind of like that same boxed cake mix cake, or maybe the inside of a hostess ding-dong or something like that. Just a little of recognizable \"cake batter\" type of taste, but with a fluffier mouthfeel. I'm not really tasting too much grain, but the fluffiness brings it away from straight batter. In the middle of the exhale I pick up some weirder fruitiness. I'd say it's maybe cherry? It's pretty non-descript although it has a bit of the same kind of medicinal notes that cherry concentrates have. Tail end of the exhale has some waxy chocolate frosting. Again, a lot like hostess products here, or similar to the glaze on a chocolate frosted donut.  Not a lot of harshness, but it does seem to tighten up my chest a bit. I have to acclimate a bit before I'm really comfortable vaping this.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  So there's that errant fruitiness, and a little bit of medicinal note. FWIW, that medicinal note seems to get more prominent as you push past 10%. \n \n**Throat Hit:**  Not really, but a bit of chest tightness, at least initially.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I think whatever weird fruitiness I'm tasting here could be amped up a bit for a fruit filling in a chocolate cake. If you don't violently hate cherry concentrates, seems like an obvious pairing.  Should work pretty well with a jammier raspberry as well.\n\nIf you wanted to go full ding-dong, some CAP Buttercream for just a bit of extra wax and maybe a touch of whipped cream for the filling. You could probably get away with a bit of HS Australian Chocolate or maybe FLV Milk chocolate to bring a bit more chocolate to the party.\n\nI think mixing this with a donut flavor would get you pretty close to a chocolate cake donut.  If you went full CAP Chocolate Glazed Donut, it should read like a chocolate donut with a chocolate glaze.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, this is a fairly weak flavor.  Chef's recommends 10%, and that seems like fairly good advice. 4% doesn't really come together for me. Some dry cake mix, but not a whole lot else. 6% is a little better. Starting to fill in a bit on the cake texture side, and I'm getting a tiny bit of richness from it. More like smelling the wrapper of a ding-dong. 8% is pretty solid. Good chocolate note, about as much body as you're going to get with this, wax is still pretty mellow and complimentarty at the end. 10% is a little more aggressive, I'm getting more of that fruit flavor and more whatever weird medicinal note is sitting in there.  Chocolate doesn't seem much richer, but maybe it's a bit more present. 12 is feeling like a little much. Fairly hard to vape this high, and that medicinal note is getting bitter. I'd probably stay around 8% for this, and accent around it.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nPretty darn sparse.\n\n[/u/flat4gt30 doesn't mince words: \"Choco yum cake is atrocious, I think they ordered too many of a particular set of flavors and in order to get rid of the extra, they mixed something that could fool a novice DIYer as a full flavor. If you came into the game after the bronuts craze this flavor will make you sad, its not you, its the flavor. Personally this is almost unvapable.\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/4zizno/first_time_buying_from_osdiy_review/)\n\n[Here's the product page from OSDIY.
