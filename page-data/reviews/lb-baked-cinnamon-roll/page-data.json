Shout out to Liquid Barn*\n\n**Setup:** Recoil w/ flavor barrel, Dual 15 wrap 26g 3mm Nifethal 70 coils @.17 ohms.  60w power, 450F temp limit. Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Liquid Barn Baked Cinnamon Roll, 3 and 5%  @ 1g/ml, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 30 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  This doesn't really feel like a full bakery by itself.  As odd as it sounds, this seems like mostly just the \"baked\" part of a baked cinnamon roll.\n\nI'm not getting too much actual roll here.  I'm getting some very warm, authentic baked sweet dough kind of top notes but without any of the doughy body underneath.  And it definitely tastes baked, or at least it tastes like a baking cinnamon roll smells.  Very light yeast-risen note, but I have no idea where the rest of the cinnamon roll is.\n\nThe cinnamon portion of this is really interesting.  There's some cinnamon spice here, but not an overwhelming bakery cinnamon flavor.  Again, this is doing a really accurate job of capturing the top notes from that cinnamon swirl in a cinnamon roll, but I'm not getting any of the depth or richness.  It mostly gives an impression of that cinnamon rather than the dead-on flavor.  There's almost the outline of some of the butter you'd expect in there, but it doesn't really translate to that kind of richness.\n\nThis is fairly sweet, even without much body.  The sweetness itself has a baked raisin character to it and is fairly accurate but really thin.  So this baked cinnamon roll definitely had some raisins in there.  The sweetness level could be conducive to some kind of icing, but it's sort of hard to tell without the body of it.  I'm also getting a little bit of dark bakery vanilla, but it's pretty well balanced and doesn't really stand out.\n\nSo my biggest issue here is going to the lack of actual body.  The top notes here are spooky accurate but they just don't have much to latch on.  There's some fluffy body, but there's very little flavor in there to fill it up.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  The flavor just seems to be missing anything beyond the top notes, but nothing really off. There's some raisins in here, which work but may not be what you're looking for.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light.  There's some definite warmth which can be a bit much, but the cinnamon itself is relatively easy-going.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 3%, this is all top notes.  Light bakery cinnamon, and the smell of fresh baked cinnamon rolls. Sweetness level isn't overwhelming, and the raisin note is fairly light.\n\nAt 5%, I'm still not getting much body here.  The cinnamon still isn't over the top but is a little more intense.  I'm not picking up too much breadiness. Starts to push toward an icing level of sweetness, and that raisin note is sticking out a bit more.\n\nLiquid Barn suggests mixing this at 5%, but I'm not sure that's really necessary, as it doesn't really pick up the body for a primary note. I'd be mixing with this between 2-3% and using it an accent.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I'm not really feeling this a solo flavor, but I think it should have some really interesting applications as a \"baked\" additive for profiles that involve cinnamon.  I could see using this a heavier, breadier cinnamon roll like FW Cinnamon Roll to really make it feel more freshly baked, basically turning the top notes way up.  The light raisin thing also makes me think of cinnamon raisin bread.  I could also see this working in stuff like coffee cakes or even apple pies or fruit cobblers to help sell that bakery warmth.\n\nOutside of a bakery enhancer, this is going to be really interesting as an accent for warmer tobacco vapes, especially if you're throwing some fruit in there.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Here's the ELR Page.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/32191)  User \"jojo\" writes: \" 6% ( SnV - not sure about this one. Not getting any cinnamon. 10 days - still not getting much here. 2 weeks - same. 3 weeks - same. Kinda sweet maybe? 5 weeks - still just kinda sweet. A little cinnamon, maybe.)\"  User \"kohl\" pretty much nails it: \"Definitely an extract to ADD a baked flavor,, not any kind of primary flavor. Isn't very sweet, nor does it taste like a cinnamon roll, but it definitely tastes baked.\"  User \"Amy***\" writes: \"Smells strong of cinnamon but the taste in a batch is mostly light surrounded by a bready danish roll not enough cream so you'll have to support it there but the bready cinnamon roll is good.\"\n\n[User \"Amy2\" has quick reviews up on the ELR Forum.  Her take: \"Not super strong on the cinnamon as it smells nice rounded back notes and blender quality. Has acetoin in it so gives that bready bakery feel to it. I smell a syrup then a bit of cinnamon off the bottle.\"](http://forum.e-liquid-recipes.com/t/liquid-barn-tasting-notes/66705)\n\n[Liquid Barn's product page.
