    "result": {"data":{"reviewsJson":{"markdown":"**Setup:** Velocity clone; dual twisted 28awg @ .55Î©; cotton wicks; 40 W\n\n**Testing:** LA Lemonade @ 3%; Aged: 2 weeks\n\n**Flavor description:**  Sugary and tart, bright lemon, rather candy like.  Relatively dry by itself.  Somewhat reminiscent to Lemon Heads candy.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  none\n\n**Throat hit:** 9/10 rather harsh by itself.\n\n**Uses:**  Use at a small percentage (<1%) to accent/brighten other fruits, or crank up the % to really push a lemon note in your mix.  Also, if you're making /u/vurve 's legendary [Best Damn Pink Lemonade](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/3427#best_damn_pink_lemonade_by_vurve), you're going to need this one.\n\n**Pairings:**  Your favorite fruits or creams.  EM might be helpful to take away some of the harshness if you aren't using a cream.  Koolada works well if you're into the \"cold lemonade\" sensation.  Tea and Champagne flavors come to mind as well.\n\n**Notes:**   This concentrate is a bit weak at 3% and may require upping the percentage or pairing with another lemon flavoring to achieve a nice strong lemon taste in a mix.  In comparison to FLV Lemonade, it is close, but I personally get a bit more of a \"Country Time powdered mix\" sensation from FLV's version.\n\nEDIT: [Link to all of our flavor reviews in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)","author":"wh1skeyk1ng","title":"Lemonade","url":"https://redd.it/591soz","vendor":{"name":"LorAnn","code":"LA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"LA","title":"Lemonade"}},
