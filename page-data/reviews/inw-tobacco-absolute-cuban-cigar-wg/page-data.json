It has the wet leaf wrap, the shredded cigar tobacco, and the ever so slight ashy aftertaste.  I would put this right in the middle of the spectrum dark/light wise as far as tobaccos go, for it is a slightly dark, slightly light tobacco that carries a surprising bit of moisture.  It also has a slight leathery back note, which is expected with some tobaccos.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Nothing really off here, it tastes a lot like vaping an average priced cigar.\n\n**Throat hit:** 7/10 decently rich @3%, likely a lot less if used as an accent.\n\n**Uses:** Standalone 3% it's legit, 4% I haven't tested, but with other INW tobaccos, I would imagine this getting numbingly richer.  This would also work at 0.5-1% to round out something weaker like FA Cuban Supreme or another mild tobacco flavor in your arsenal.\n\n**Pairings:**  Milder tobaccos, tobacco additives, vanilla, brown sugar, caramel, butterscotch, coffee, maybe some light cream if you want to tone it down.\n\n**Notes:** This leaves a filmy residue in my dropper bottle as well as my tank, still noticeable after the 4 week mark.  I question its health risks due to the residue, but it is tasty if you're a tobacco head.  It tastes slightly funky before a decently long steep, but the wait turns over a whole different realm of taste.  I would recommend a full 3 week steep minimum before you judge this flavor, maybe even 4+.\n\nFlavor available at BCF [here](http://www.bullcityflavors.com/tobacco-absolute-cuban-cigar-wg-inw/) \n\n[Link to e-liquid-recipes notes on this flavor](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/12406)\n\n[Link to all of our flavor reviews in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)\n\n\nedit word","author":"wh1skeyk1ng","title":"Tobacco Absolute Cuban Cigar WG","url":"https://redd.it/6fq5pi","vendor":{"name":"Inawera","code":"INW"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"INW","title":"Tobacco Absolute Cuban Cigar WG"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
