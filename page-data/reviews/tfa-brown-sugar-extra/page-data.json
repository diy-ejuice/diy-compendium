    "result": {"data":{"reviewsJson":{"markdown":"* **Setup:** Velocity 24 gauge twisted Nichrome & Kanthal Half Wick @50 Watts\n* **Testing:** (TPA) Brown Sugar Extra @ .5%. Max VG, steeped 7 days.\n* **Caution:** Note: This flavor contains 'custard' ingredients: Acetoin & Acetyl Propionyl\n* **Flavor Description:** This flavor is somewhere in the brown sugar area, but not in a scooped-out-of-the-package kind of way, but more like a heated-with-a-blowtorch kind of way. This may be because of it being something that is originally made for food so it is not used to being heated up the way it is in vaping. \n* **Off-flavors:** It kind of has a caramel-y taste. It is also slightly burnt, especially at higher temps. IF you go any higher than 2% it will start to taste like a campfire, and not in a good way.  \n* **Throat Hit:**2/10\n* **Uses & Pairings:** This will always find a way into bakery type flavors. Pies, Cakes, and Very Bright and Very Dark fruits. It could be good in Flambe recipes like Bananas Foster, Cherries Jubilee, or Christmas Pudding.   \n* **Notes:** The problem with this flavor is that you may want to add just a hint of brown sugar and reach for this flavor, but it is not light enough to be brown sugar. Like I said before it is more of a burnt caramel than it is brown sugar. With that being said I think it does have its place in mixing and if you are expecting to mix up other peoples recipes, you better grab this one up, however a 10ml will keep you satisfied for a while. \n\nIf you are looking for more mixing related content subscribe to my [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcfR6mXMRm-Iu3psoDrxGyA)","author":"cloudstatevapor","title":"Brown Sugar Extra","url":"https://redd.it/5wsmyd","vendor":{"name":"The Flavor Apprentice","code":"TFA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"TFA","title":"Brown Sugar Extra"}},
