A syrupy and thick mouthfeel, moderately dense 6 out of 10.             \n          \n**Throat Hit** 1/10           \n\n**Flavor Properties** \n\nSweet & sour  plum flavoring with a light hint of smoke, giving it Contrast and just the right amount of sour to set off sweet notes. This one definitely has unami sweet savory and delicious.\n\n**Relatable Flavors** \n\nThis reminds me of eating prunes, a great Plum flavoring that is dry and sweet.\n\n**Off Flavors** \n\nSweetness dissipates quickly, and you're left with a dry bitter aftertaste, not unpleasant but I didn't feel was a little off.\n\n**Position In The Recipe** \n\nAs a accent should really help dry out a recipe, adding savory too sweet flavorings, and provide contrast. Can also  work well as a base note to build on. \n\n**Pairings**  \n\nOther Stone fruits, berrys, tropical fruits, tobacco's, bakeries, and other Savory flavors such as INW shisha Rosemary.      \n\n**Recipe**\n\nhttps://alltheflavors.com/recipes/6882       \n       \n**Notes**    \n\nhttp://www.ecigexpress.com/catalogsearch/result/?q=smoked+Plum           \n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suanmeitang\n\n**Rating** 90/100  \n\n*Please if your opinion differs, or you have another review for this post it in the comments.
