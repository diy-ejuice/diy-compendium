Not one of those deluxe waffle cones you have to pay extra for, this is the cheap, thin vanilla wafer like cone. Not to say it isn't delicious. It is like part sugar cookie (though not as heavy as cap sugar cookie) and part vanilla wafer (though not as dry or buttery as inw biscuit). I don't know if it is power of suggestion but I can almost taste those little squares that are stamped into the cone. \n\n**Off-flavors:**  Nothing at this percentage\n\n**Throat Hit:**  This is very smooth and only slightly touches the throat due to dryness.\n\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I would use this just as intended, as an ice cream cone. It is perfect for this because it isn't so heavy that it gets in the way of the ice cream you would want to spotlight with this flavor. It adds just a slight sweetness and bakery to accent your best ice cream recipe. I can't see this being used in any other bakeries because there are other flavors that do that better.\n\n\n**Notes:**\nAt 2% I get a nice strong flavor with no off notes. I can see this being pushed to 3 or 4% if you want it to be more of a main note, but for me to be used as a sugar cone, I would stick to this percentage. \n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nThere really isn't much out there for this flavor.\n\n[deweysuds uses this in his pecan roll](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/23230#rollin_by_deweysuds)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**\n\nIf you have different opinions on the flavor or any ideas on how to use it please post them in the comments.
