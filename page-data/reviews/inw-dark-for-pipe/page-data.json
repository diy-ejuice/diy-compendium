    "result": {"data":{"reviewsJson":{"markdown":"**Setup:** Lycan RDA by Cigreen; single twisted 24awg @ .40Î©; cotton wicks; 45W\n\n**Testing:** INW Dark for Pipe @ 3%; Aged: 27 days\n\n**Flavor description:**  Prominently dark and moist pipe tobacco with a bit of a dry rolling tobacco in the background.  Heavier notes of dark chocolate over subtle notes of sweet honey and delicate spices blend in well with the robust tobaccos to create a rather earthy, rich, and complex blend of taste.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Not getting anything off-tasting here.\n\n**Throat hit:** 4/10 Noticeable yet rather smooth.\n\n**Uses:**  Great in a base for a tobacco recipe 1-4%.  At lower percentages (<0.5%), I can see this being included in select bakery blends without over-powering it with tobacco taste.\n\n**Pairings:** Chocolate, honey, nuts, vanilla, oak, maple, dark or dry fruits, alcohol (flavorings or actual cocktails)\n\n**Notes:**   As with most tobaccos, this flavor is going to require at least 3 weeks of steep time for all of the nuances to come out.  It holds its own as a standalone for someone wanting something reminiscent of tobacco without much of an ashy taste.\n\nEDIT: [Link to all of our flavor reviews in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)\n","author":"wh1skeyk1ng","title":"Dark for Pipe","url":"https://redd.it/56o1se","vendor":{"name":"Inawera","code":"INW"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"INW","title":"Dark for Pipe"}},
