With a hint from the community, I considered testing it at 10% flavoring.\nWith the mix at 10% off the shake, I could identify that that's getting more pleasant but I would recommend giving it 10 days steep time.\nThere is an overall present caramel which presents to me on the inhale. Quite a dark taste which could be going into a dryness on my palate. I can taste a cookie middle part, which has the right taste and presence but no texture. I can't identify any real coconut in it, not even a hint.\nTrying this one-shot in a mix I discovered that I need to crank up my regular wattage a 10-15% to reduce dryness in the vape.\nI still have a dry aftertaste from vaping it even using the higher wattage.  \n\n**&#128313; Comments &#128313;**  \nThis is a very dark concentrate and that's always something I try to avoid. This brings the overall grade together with the lack of flavor in some areas down to a C.\nThis concentrate is available at Bull City Flavors or directly at Gremberry Farms. Recommended usage for me is 10 %.","author":"Steve-TC","title":"Samoan Dreams","url":"https://redd.it/rjyz96","vendor":{"name":"Gremberry Farms Solo's","code":"GRM"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"GRM","title":"Samoan Dreams"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
