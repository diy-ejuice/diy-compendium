Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Irish Cream @ 1% and 1 drop per 10 ml (about .25%), 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 13 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Coffee forward Irish Cream. Almost more like a cup of dark roasted coffee with a solid slug of Irish Cream. Dense, fluffy texture, with a slighty nutty taste to the chocolate cream back end.  Coffee note is closer to a traditional coffee note like FA Dark Bean rather than a syrupy coffee liqueur.  Chocolate cream notes basically scale up after .25% work hit their stride around 1%. Pretty full, dominant flavor, I'd use as pretty much a standalone with some selective backup starting at .75% and working up.\n\nInhale is sweet and almost a bit marshmallow-y, with a fluffy texture.  Higher dark roasted coffee notes with a bit of a bittersweet chocolate edge.  Base has a heavy cream taste but not quite the texture, just a bit too airy. Exhale has a sweet dark coffee note up front, more like a sweet black coffee as opposed to a coffee liqeuer. Top notes start to come out and are pretty similar to darker roasted strong coffee flavors, with a bit of dark almost burnt bitterness.  Not overwhelmingly strong at 1%, doesn't quite pick up that buttery burnt note I get from some solo coffee flavors.  Creamier base also comes out on the back end, with a deeper slightly nutty heavy cream kind of taste with a bit of chocolate to it.  I think the combination of the top notes from the dark roasted coffee and the milkier chocolate base together are making up that nutty note.  All of it is fairly well balanced overall. Relatively dense, but fairly fluffy instead of a heavier solid cream note.  Sweet, but a sugar kind of sweetness, as opposed to a heavy sucralose hit.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  More of a dark black coffee note than a sweeter softer coffee liquer.  I personally wouldn't feel the need to add any more cofee on top of this.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light, a little dry and fluffy solo.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This is a fairly busy flavor, especially up towards 1% and I'd say it's better as a stand-alone, or a the base for a flavor with some careful accents.  You could accentuate the cream here with some FLV Cream or CAP Vanilla Whipped Cream for a touch of something like whipped cream on top.  You could also go down the chocolate route with INW Mocca or FLV Milk Chocolate if you wanted to end up with a mocha.\n\nOutside of a coffee with Irish Cream vape, I think this would make a really good base for a coffee ice cream or milkshake.  It's fairly creamy on it's own at 1% and above, adding in some vienna cream and vbic should get you pretty close to an ice cream flavor.\n\nIf you want to pair a fruitier accent, I'd stick to darker berries.  Should also pair well with a bit of mint.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, I get a clear flavor here at .25%. Lots of that coffee note up front, with a bit of more neutral, slightly nutty cream on the back end. A bit fluffy, not a lot of richness. .5% doesn't really seem to have that much more coffee than .25%, cream is a little heavier and I'm getting a bit of a cocoa edge to that nuttier cream on the back end.  At 1%, the back end of this is really starting to solidify and I'm getting some heavier cream notes and a definite chocolate to it. Pretty full flavored as is with a denser but still slightly fluffy texture.  At 1.5%, I'm getting a bit of that buttery burnt kind of coffee taste out of the coffee part of this, while the cream is kind of getting buttery and whipped at the same time. Not necessarily a good time. 2% seems pretty solidly bitter up front.  I'd recommend using this as a primary flavor between .75-1.5%, depending on your personal tolerance for coffee vapes.\n\nComparing this to FA Irish Cream, the FLV seems a little more geared towards tasting like a full coffee vape. I get more dark coffee out of the FLV than the FA version. The FA Version ends up being more realistic to just Irish Cream, although they both have their charms.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nAgain, not a whole lot.\n\n[Here is the FLV product page. Their description: \"Classic and comforting Irish cream. There is no reason to make this a seasonal flavor, and you wonâ€™t want to give it up once you get a try. Well balanced for standalone use, but can also be manipulated with some other creams and rich flavors.\"](http://store.flavorah.com/concentrated-irish-cream-flavor)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Irish Cream","url":"https://redd.it/6beb49","vendor":{"name":"Flavorah","code":"FLV"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FLV","title":"Irish Cream"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
