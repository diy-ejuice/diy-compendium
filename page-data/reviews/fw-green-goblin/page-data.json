Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FW Green Goblin, 4 and 8%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 5 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  [Spot on OG Green Monster](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/27/99/41/279941af922dd02de61599d21b7e516f--monster-energy-nails-monster-nails.jpg), at least flavor wise.  Sweet, tastes like whatever unholy abomination of fruityish candy flavors normally in straight up monster, and even a surprisingly accurate version of that weird plasticy \"energy\" taste that monster has to it.  I still have no clue what real-world monster flavor is based on, but this definitely has that smarties dissolved in a vaguely citrusy battery acid thing that's true to profile.  The texture has some issues for a beverage vape though.  I think the sweetness level is pretty pleasant for a sugary profile, but solo it's a bit dry.  The bottom end of this has that heavy chalky sweetness, and the top notes are lit up with some citrus and that weird monster plastic flavor, but it feels a bit thin in the center though. I wouldn't overthink this... It's a solid base for an energy drink flavor that will play well with an added bright fruit flavor and some cooling. I'd stick to using this a stronger base for a mix, and probably mix around 6-8%.\n\nInhale is tart and sharp.  There's maybe some citrus in there, but it's honestly a bit hard to pick up much beyond that kind of plasticy \"monster\" energy flavor. It's certainly accurate to profile. Building sweet-tarts/smarties chalky candy sweetness underneath. Inhale seems a bit dry overall. Exhale has that same kind of non-descript tart, bitter top note right up front in the top notes. Accurately sweet monster-y base underneath those top notes. Seems to be a bit of hollow space in the middle of this flavor between where the top notes tail off a bit and the lower sweetness of the base.  Overall a bit dry and chalky in terms of mouthfeel. Lingering plastic monster taste.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Nothing really off from the profile.  With that said, monster tastes bizarre.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light, more from the dryness than the actual tarter parts of this concentrate.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I'm not sure there is such a thing as a \"hint\" of orginal monster flavor. Even the non-standard monsters just ditch the flavor entirely.  I'd just accent around it and fill it out a bit.\n\nI'd probably start with adding something a bit wet to kind of cut this a bit and moisten the vape.  My bet would be TPA Champagne, because the citrus in there should fit in pretty well and it helps to give a watery volume. INW Cactus or CAP Cucumber would probably work, although they'd drag the profile in a different direction.\n\nI also think some cooling would help.\n\nIf you're going add in an accent flavor I'd stick with a big, bright, and non-floral fruit.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, this seems to be a weaker flavor but it's pretty linear.  It's definitely on the light side at 2%.  More just a hint of that monster plastic taste, and some watery sweetness. At 4% it still seems thin and watered down.  6% seems fuller overall.  A little sweeter, decent body, and suffiecently monstery.  I'd stop here if you don't plan on adding something to thin out the mix.  At 8% it's a solid sweetness and it feels like it's getting drier.  Flavor is bold but not quite overpowering. At 10% this is getting too sweet, dry, and maybe just a bit bitter. 12% feels like eating monster-flavored kool-aid mix.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Here's a reddit thread from a couple years ago about using this concentrate. OP calls it dull, suggestions include citrus, sour, champagne, cooling, and another fruit flavor.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/3732wk/anybody_have_experience_with_green_goblin_fw/)\n\n[Here are your BCF reviews. Nothing too in depth, but people seem to dig this for the most part.](http://www.bullcityflavors.com/green-goblin-fw/)\n\n[Pretty sure this is labeled as FW Monstourous on ECX.  4.6 stars out of 32 reviews. Lots of \"It tastes just like green monster.\"  User \"Spencer\" calls it \"easily lost\" when mixing, but that doesn't seem to be a common complaint.  Most percentage recommendations are between 10-20%.](http://www.ecigexpress.com/diy-e-liquid/browse-flavorings/beverage-flavors/monstrous-by-flavor-west.html)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**\n\nShoutout to ID10-T for suggesting this for review.","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Green Goblin","url":"https://redd.it/6v1eb7","vendor":{"name":"Flavor West","code":"FW"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FW","title":"Green Goblin"}},
