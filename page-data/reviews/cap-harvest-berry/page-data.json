{"componentChunkName":"component---src-components-review-js","path":"/reviews/cap-harvest-berry","result":{"data":{"reviewsJson":{"markdown":"**Setup:** Velocity clone; dual twisted 28awg @ .55Î©; cotton wicks; 40 W\n\n**Testing:** CAP Harvest Berry @ 3%; Aged: 5 days\n\n**Flavor description:**  Fairly balanced mix of blueberry, blackberry, raspberry, cherry, purple grapes, white grapes, hints of strawberry, plum, and apple in there too.  Somewhat juicy with a subtle tartness.  I would say it is a brighter mix well accented by darker fruits that don't over-power each other.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Can come off as slightly woody and a bit dry at higher (6%+) percentages, but typically goes away with enough steep time.  Some, but not all users also report a medicine taste.\n\n**Throat hit:** 3/10 \n\n**Uses:**  A great backbone for a fruity mix.  Enjoy it as the lone fruit, or accent it with your preferred fruit flavorings.\n\n**Pairings:** Literally any cream, or your favorite fruits.  I could also see this tasting good with some of your sweeter tobacco flavorings.\n\n**Notes:**   This flavoring is rumored to be used in many commercial juices, so if you're trying to clone something but you just can't nail down the fruit part, TRY THIS and see what else you need to add to it, if anything.\n\nEDIT: [Link to all of our flavor reviews in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)","author":"wh1skeyk1ng","title":"Harvest Berry","url":"https://redd.it/57jab1","vendor":{"name":"Capella","code":"CAP"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"CAP","title":"Harvest Berry"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
