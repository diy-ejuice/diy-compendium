SS316L spaced single coil, approx 0.76 ohms at 16 watts in power mode\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Testing** 3% in 65/35 VG/PG base, steep time 2-3 weeks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Flavor Description** A distinct vanilla flavor amidst a cream that isn't sour nor really sweet.  After the 3rd week, the creamy mellows out and does lose some of it's vanilla-ness.  It does give the impression of being ice-cream-like yet at room temperature.  Just a tiny touch of sweetness present.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Off Flavors/Mouth Feel** Around Week 2 it gives a nice creamy finish.  Yet another week or more and it's faded.  Either way, it's still coming across as a bit dry.  It isn't peppery yet it's got a slight minty feel.  EDIT:  Generally light and airy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Throat Hit** Maybe a tinge of a hit but more of that mouth feel mentioned above.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Uses** To me, it's screaming to be paired with banana creams/puddings, some coffees and for making RY4-ish tobaccos.  Might work extremely well for some chai tea recipes for an obscure spiced milk note.  Not sure if TFA's Vanila Bean Ice Cream can be subbed out using this flavor.  I just haven't used VBIC yet... but do feel that it can step in for a more complex use than their Vanilla Swirl.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Speculation** I have no real frame of reference for gelato.  Never tried it, so can't imagine how accurate this represents it.  It's possible that this could work if for something like vanilla soda.  It might even combine well with an orange and dark cola.  Anywhere that vanilla type flavors are combined with cinnamon, this would probably be a nice combination like some complex bakeries (a la mode?).  I would not likely ever use this in any kind of liquor.\n\nIt does seem like heavy vaping this as a stand-alone will lead to vaper's tongue within a few hours.  Definitely not an all-day vape nor would I recommend it in any shake-n-vape since the flavor changed somewhat with longer steep.  Still, it's good... even better when chased by a swig of black hot coffee.  :)","author":"RancerDS","title":"Vanilla Bean Gelato","url":"https://redd.it/bpg5kq","vendor":{"name":"The Flavor Apprentice","code":"TFA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"TFA","title":"Vanilla Bean Gelato"}},
