Light cream.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Flavor Description:** Fresh strawberries blended with fresh banana and creamy plain yogurt. The strawberry is a sweet strawberry, and the banana is perfectly ripe. Not cloying overripe nor green. The balance is very good between the 2 fruits, with the strawberry just a tad more upfront than the banana. Smooth and light plain yogurt provides a mild creaminess. No detectable vanilla flavor, nor tanginess. Very natural level of sweetness for a yogurt smoothie, with all the sweetness originating from the fruit itself and no sweeteners added. At 4 weeks I am still surprised with how good the balance is with this one. The banana has blended very well with the strawberries still being upfront and not buried beneath the banana. The creaminess has also improved with the longer steep.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:** None\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit:** 1/10\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Pairings:** Cakes, cereal, creams, custards, nuts, yogurt, koolada, menthol.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Notes:** With a shot of Koolada this is a very authentic smoothie. I am thinking it would also be nice with menthol or peppermint. The flavor was medium strength at this percentage, I would go for 8-10% for a good single flavor strength.\n","author":"mysticrosell","title":"Strawnana Smoothie","url":"https://redd.it/6dkphu","vendor":{"name":"Purilum","code":"PUR"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"PUR","title":"Strawnana Smoothie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
