Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FW S'mores, 2 and 4%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 14 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** A complicated profile, this seems to do the \"toasted\" and the \"graham\" better than the actual gooey part of the marshmallow and the chocolate.  Relatively heavy toasted note without too much fluffy or sticky marshmallow. Heavier dry graham cracker.  A bit hard to pick out over the toasted part of the marshmallow, but I feel like there is maybe a bit of cinnamon to it.  Chocolate is weak here.  Not really the richer melted milk chocolate thing I'd want from a smore, more powdery and dry.  Seems like a decent base for a smore flavor if you want to go light on the chocolate.  The marshmallow thing should be pretty easy to fix, the chocolate not so much. The ends up tasting pretty toasted and dry at higher percentages, I'd mix around 4%.\n\nInhale is a bit dry and almost spicy from that toasted marshmallow note. Pretty heavy graham cracker grain and texture to it, if maybe just a hair light on graham cracker taste. Seems like there might even be a bit of smoke to that slightly astringent, warm, toasted part of the marshmallow. Some sweetness but not really heavy or sugary. Exhale opens up with some more recognizable graham cracker.  Not a lot of softer marshmallow here, but it does show up, with that toasted top note. Chocolate hits on the end of the exhale.  Drier chocolate kind of disappears into the graham cracker texture. Not really harsh but a bit dry. Lingering slightly chemical toasted marshmallow note.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Balanced more towards dry and toasted, without anything too rich or gooey. Toasted note has a bit of a chemical edge to it, but not too much more aggressive than something like TPA Toasted Marshmallow.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Not really harsh, but a bit dry and sharp.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Needs some more gooeyness, both from the marshmallow and a richer chocolate flavor.  Crazy idea here, but [FLV Smore](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/6awla6/flv_smore/) does the chocolate and the fluffy part of the marshmallow really well.  This does the toasted and the graham.  Combine them and profit?  As a S&V at 4% FW and 1% FLV, this seems like it has some promise.\n\nThis would probably be a pretty decent s'more note for mixing with creams or other bakeries.  It's a bit drier but still conveys a s'more pretty well, so should theoretically let creamier dessert bases do their thing without dragging too much marshmallow to the party.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, this seems a bit stronger than the newer batch of FW flavors. I'm getting a fairly full flavor at 2%.  Not quite as toasted, and the graham cracker texture is a bit soft, but you can pick out all of the components here. 4% is on the dryer side.  More toasted, heavier graham texture. That dry toasted note pushes around the relatively weak marshmallow body and chocolate quite a bit, but it's not a bad tradeoff for texture if you're going to be bolstering those. 6% tastes a little too dry. Toasted note is becoming too aggressive and artificial. 8% has a pretty solid chemical edge to it from the toasting.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nNah, still new.\n\n[Here's the Flavorwest product page.
