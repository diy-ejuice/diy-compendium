Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Ice @ 1% and 1 drop per 10 ml (about .25%) both with 1% FLV Grape, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 12 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Similar effect to Koolada, but this tastes a bit bitter and seems a bit weak compared to the stock TPA Stuff.  I'm getting some clear cooling on the exhale, but that bitterness is a bit of a bummer. Koolada at 1% will blow my entire vape out, and I'm not getting a ton of cooling from this at 1%.  This feels like maybe 1/3 as strong as Koolada in terms of cooling.  Not to editorialize too much, but I though FLV Cool Menthol was really well done, but this falls a bit flat for me. I'm not seeing a lot of applications for this where Koolada isn't cleaner and a better fit.  I could be having some kind of weird reaction to this, but this isn't really working for me as well as I had hoped.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  This tastes a bit bitter to me.  Not a really strong kind of chemical taste, but a weird kind of bitterness here that almost crosses into savory. \n\n**Throat Hit:**  Seems to add a bit of throat hit to the juice.  The bitterness kind of accumulates at the back of the throat.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Use is pretty interchangable with Koolada but it seems weaker.  I can see this working better with more basic sweet fruit mixes, where that light bitterness may actually help cut some sweetness.\n\nKoolada gets used in low percentages with cream bases for chilled milkshakes and ice creams. The bitterness here makes Ice a worse choice in those applications.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration wise, this seems quite a bit weaker than I'd expect.  This was all tested with 1% FLV Grape in the mix as well. I get some bitterness and maybe a bare hint of cooling at .25%. .5% isn't drastically cooler, maybe about equivalent to 2 drops per 30ml of Koolada.  1% is a bit cooler, but I'm really picking up that bitterness.  I've definitely got that building bitterness at the back of my throat.  1.5% still isn't unbearably cool for me. Bitterness seems to have topped out though. 2% is maybe about equivalent to a little over .5% of Koolada.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nI haven't found any, which is a bummer because I'm curious if it's just me that this isn't working for or if I got a weird batch.\n\n[Here is the FLV product page. Their description: \"aThis is a flavorless cooling sensation. It adds a brisk freeze like menthol, but without the green leaf mint taste that comes with menthols and other mints. \"](http://store.flavorah.com/concentrated-ice-flavor)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Ice","url":"https://redd.it/6b9crx","vendor":{"name":"Flavorah","code":"FLV"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FLV","title":"Ice"}},
