Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Jungle Flavors Marshmallow, 1 and 4%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 15 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Pretty much a cereal marshmallow.\n\nThe vanilla here is fairly prominent.  It's kind of continuing the cereal marshmallow theme, with a brighter one-dimensional vanilla.  Closest to something like a straight vanillin flavor with no real darker or spicier accents to it.  There's also some maltiness here, it almost tastes dusted in some of the crushed up cereal itself.  There's also just a light bit of chemical twinge at higher percentages, but it's pretty subtle at usable percentages.\n\nThis has a drier texture, almost feels a bit crunchy rather than soft and chewy.  Moderate volume, but that dryness feels a lot more like a meringue than a straight campfire marshmallow.  True to profile, this is fairly sweet.  Seems pretty appropriate for a cereal style marshmallow.\n\nTrying to place this in the constellation of available marshmallow flavors, feels the most similar to the flavorah version.  Both this and flavorah marshmallow have that drier cereal marshmallow vibe.  I think the vanilla here is a bit brighter and more artificial than the flavorah version, and that one seems to have just a bit deeper body to it.  The actual vanilla note here pushes closer to that CAP New Marshmallow, but not nearly as chemical and weird.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Bright vanilla has quite a bit of malt and some light chemical notes.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light.  Not nearly the same kind of smooth as TPA, but nothing unduly harsh here.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 1% I'm getting some volume out of this, with a bit of bright vanilla.  Not much depth to the flavor, and almost a powdered sugar dryness on the edges.  Doesn't really jump out as a marshmallow, cereal or otherwise here.\n\nAt 4% this has gone full lucky charms on me.  Vanilla is bright, texture is kind of dessicated, and I'm getting that malty note pretty clearly.  A bit thicker than 1%, but not quite dense.\n\nJust based on these tests, I'd probably use this at 2.5-3% if you want it to actually taste like a marshmallow.  Just trying to use it a sweetener, I'd probably be around 1.5% in candy profiles and closer to 1% with fruits and stuff.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:** The most natural fit for this would be just running with the cereal marshmallow thing.  Pretty good option for a cereal milk or a roll your own lucky charms type of vape.\n\nThis probably isn't the kind of marshmallow you would use to knock the sharp edges off a recipe or to add volume and texturize a recipe.  This doesn't have a lot of the neutral volume and muting of something like TPA.\n\nUsing this with fruits is going to come across like sprinkling powdered sugar on top.  I think this would have some use like FA Meringue, but without that heavier bakery taste and the light eggy notes.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  Again, I'm not finding much out there.\n\n[Here's the product page from ECX.](http://www.ecigexpress.com/shop/diy-e-liquid/diy-e-liquid-flavors/jungle-flavors/fruit-and-sweet/marshmallow-by-jungle-flavors.html)  Their description: \"Enjoy the sweet , simple taste of fluffy marshmallows in your next DIY recipe with Marshmallow from Jungle flavors!
