Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** CAP Cranberry @ 4%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 17 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Inhale is slightly sweet and perfumey. High perfumey notes continue into the exhale, along with a deep sweet cooked berry flavor.  Almost a dark rum note.  Not a whole lot of midrange or juicyness here.  Moderate sweetness. Sticky mouthfeel with especially with sustained use.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Steeped, maybe a bit of metallic tang on the deeper berry notes.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  1/10.  Just barely there harshness.\n\n**Uses:**  Fruit mixes, especially depth and variety to a berry mix.  Cocktails.  Stickier mouthfeel would lend itself to a cranberry sauce type of mix.\n\n**Pairings:** Citrus, especially lime. Grape, Apple. Rhubarb. Pretty much any berry you want to throw at it. Seems to accentuate perfumey notes, so I'd avoid stone fruits.\n\n**Notes:**  What's more festive than a review of a concentrate that everyone, myself included, already wrote off? Nothing short of genocide, that's what.  S&V strength testing, I'd go for 2-3% for an assertive component in a mix and up to 6% solo.  This flavor also needs a decent steep.  I find it pretty offputting as a S&V. Steeping mellows it into something a little on the weak side.  Decent sweeter cranberry flavor, but FLV is just a ton better.\n\nToday, I am thankful for FLV Cranberry and football on TV all day.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Hey, look! There's an entire FOTW of the week about Cranberry.  All 2 accounts of CAP Cranberry are negative.  Even the one who isn't me.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/5831t7/fotw_this_weeks_flavor_is_cranberry/)\n\n[It's probably better than TFA though.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/34gvqj/tfa_vs_cap_cranberry/)\n\n[2 Five star reviews on ECX.](http://www.ecigexpress.com/shop/diy-e-liquid/diy-e-liquid-flavors/capella-flavor-drops/capella-fruit-flavors/cranberry-capella-flavor-drops.html)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Cranberry","url":"https://redd.it/5epm04","vendor":{"name":"Capella","code":"CAP"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"CAP","title":"Cranberry"}},
