Not overpowering or sickly sweet.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Flavor Properties:**\n\n- mellow pipe style tobacco\n- lightly sweet\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Relatable Flavors:**\n\n- sort of a floral vanilla in the front (just on the first few puffs, not that noticeable after the coil warms up)\n- chocolate undertones which form the base for this flavor\n- reminds me of SC Black Mile, I'd have to try them side by side to notice the differences\n- has that cigar wrapper feel (think Captain Black)\n- no distinct tobacco flavor at all\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Mouth Feel:**\n\n- medium density\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:**\n\n- none\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Position In A Recipe:**\n\n- background\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Suggested Percentage:**\n\n- 1-3%\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Pairings:**\n\n- SC Cohiba\n- any hearty tobacco\n- chocolate\n- nuts\n- vanilla\n- creams, custards\n- orange citrus (wildcard)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- This is something I'd use in the background of a cigar blend.\n- Feels really similar to SC Black Mile so use it the same way.\n- As mentioned, there's zero tobacco leaf taste but it does make sense as a support tobacco.\n- I'm not wildly impressed by this flavor, but also not incredibly disappointed. It could find it's purpose some day.","author":"T_Mace","title":"Blended Tobacco","url":"https://redd.it/5z166k","vendor":{"name":"Super Concentrated","code":"SC"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"SC","title":"Blended Tobacco"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
