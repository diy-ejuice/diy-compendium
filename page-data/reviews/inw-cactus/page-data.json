    "result": {"data":{"reviewsJson":{"markdown":"**Setup:** Plume Veil RDA; dual parallel @ .35Î©; cotton wicks; 45W\n\n**Testing:** INW Cactus @ 4%; Aged: 7 days\n\n**Flavor description:**  Juicy, wet, fleshy, authentically sweet without being sugary, slightly earthy.  Citrus and tropical notes throughout.  Hints of a ripe pear or green grape.  Almost seems to imply a very subtle cooling effect at the end of the exhale.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  None noticed.  \n\n**Throat hit:** 5/10. \n\n**Uses:**  Brightening up other fruits or adding juiciness.  Really brightens up a bland mix at 1-2%.  Very stellar as a standalone too.\n\n**Pairings:** Basically any fruit.  I'd even guess this flavor at 4% or more would hold it's own against a heavier cream.\n\n**Notes:** I've never eaten cactus, which is why it isn't in my description. You NEED this flavor in your arsenal if you enjoy fruit vapes.  Buy more than you think you'll use, and don't run out.  It's a real gem.  \n\nEDIT : I must add that if you put this on your coils, the flavor is probably not going to go away.\n\nEDIT 2: [Link to all of our flavor reviews in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)","author":"wh1skeyk1ng","title":"Cactus","url":"https://redd.it/4oale0","vendor":{"name":"Inawera","code":"INW"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"INW","title":"Cactus"}},
