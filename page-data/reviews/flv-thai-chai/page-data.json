IDK I'm not a doctor.  \n\nThis is a pretty niche flavoring, and IME has not been an easy one to work with, but it does fill its role rather well and can help create a very pleasant profile. It's not creamy, not earthy, not sweet, so on it's own it's not super pleasant and needs help from other ingredients to really let it shine. It is rather forward, so will most likely be a main note and will dominate more delicate flavors.  \n\n**On the Nose**  \nSpicy floral note, reminiscent of baby powder to an unsuspecting nose.\n\n**Recommended Usage**  \n*Stand alone*: 1%\n\n*In a mix*: 0.25-0.75%   \n\n**Throat**  \nMild\n\n**Pairings**  \nCreams, florals, spices, honey, \"earthy\" flavors, taro, sweetness  \n\n**Avoid**  \nNot sure, I would think bright fruits and melons.  \n\n**Steep**  \n2 days. Did not notice significant flavor fade or change in 1-2 weeks.\n\n**Quick Recipe: [Thai Tea](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/7475)**   \n*Ratio: 15PG/85VG*  \n*Steep: 3+ days*  \n\n* FA Black Tea @ 2%  \n* FLV Thai Tea @ 0.5%  \n* FLV Cream @ 0.75%  \n* FLV Milk & Honey @ 1.25%  \n* NN 5% Stevia Solution in VG @ 2.5%\n\nStill a bit of a work in progress, but I think this is the type of recipe to really showcase this flavoring. Thai Chai benefits from the earthy notes brought by the Black Tea and Stevia, as well as some creaminess and sweetness to get it to really rest on your palate and mingle with your taste buds. Props to /u/StardustCoyote for his Bubble Tea post in the [July Recipe Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/4qrd3p/july_2016_recipe_thread/) which gave me a jumping off point for Black Tea; he's also got some really good ideas for bringing a sort of tapioca pearl to the mix.  \n\n*Please if your opinion differs, or you have another review for this post it in the comments. Will help the master list with multiple reviews in one spot.*\n","author":"CheebaSteeba","title":"Thai Chai","url":"https://redd.it/4sfb61","vendor":{"name":"Flavorah","code":"FLV"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FLV","title":"Thai Chai"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
