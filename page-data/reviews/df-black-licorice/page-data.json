Alas! All my fears were for naught! This is a rather mild, sweet and tasty black licorice flavor! I was surprised to learn that licorice and anise are actually unrelated plants, because I had always associated black licorice with \"anise\" flavor. I was expecting this to have a strong Jagermeister/Absinthe type flavor, but it does not! It is rather smooth, sweet (but not overly sweet), and quite mild, this would probably be pushed deep into the background by stronger flavors.\n\n**Off-flavors:** none\n\n**Throat Hit:** none\n\n**Uses & Pairings:** This is where it gets interesting: apparently licorice is most commonly used as a tobacco flavoring. This concentrate would pair very well with any tobacco (especially pipe tobacco) to sweeten and add depth and complexity at between 2-3%. You could also use this in place of anise in recipes that need this kind of flavor but only a touch (1-2%) paired with vanilla, anise, mint, or menthol this could be a satisfying simple candy mix.\n\n**Notes:** i got this in the ATF awesome box by request. most people who got the box didn't get this. how sad... i wouldnt be surprised if this could be used solo at a higher percentage. in my search for second opinions i saw someone recommend Delosi be used at 5-12%. i wouldn't go that high but i could see 5-6% solo.\n\n**Second Opinions:** [Christy says \"I love this for a kicking vape and it tastes quite like licorice jelly beans to me.\"](http://www.delosi.com/flavoring/candies/black-licorice.html)","author":"PerennialPhilosopher","title":"Black Licorice","url":"https://redd.it/6274l4","vendor":{"name":"Delosi Flavors","code":"DF"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"DF","title":"Black Licorice"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
