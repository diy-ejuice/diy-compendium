Not your regular ni80, quite good tbf but not worth full price) @.54ohms \n\n**Percentage**: 1\n\n**Steeped**: SNV first and thrown far away to not tempt me. 7 days for this review with a LOT of temptation to pop it open again and vape it all.\n\nI literally don't want to move my vape away from my mouth, this is way too tasty. I tried it shake and vape and vaped through 4ml like it was nothing I literally had to stop myself. 7 days later it's not changed much other than becoming fuller.\n\nMost of you might remember my obsession with Jessica Alba. Well this is like being with Jessica Alba again but while Gillian Anderson reads me stories. It's ideal. It's the 2 in 1 you've craved all your life. Feel free to replace Jessica and Gillian with your preferred people or hell even objects but make sure those two people or objects complement each other and enhance their strengths just right because this flavour is just that - two things that work together great.\n\nThe passionfruit is nice and wet. Proper juicy. And it's the first note you feel on your tongue as the mango's ripe flavour comes into play. It's fantastic. It's filling your mouth with flavour and then gifting you with a lovely mango aftertaste. \n\nI can't not recommend this to everyone into the more exotic fruits. I love to eat mango in massive amounts be it on its own, with chili powder or in a mango lassi. The passionfruit complements it so well. Just beautifully. It's not overpowering. They just mix together great and work really good. \n\n**Verdict**: If you're into Jessica Alba, get this. If you're into Chris Hemsworth, get this. If you're into beaches and great relaxing summer vibes, get this. Whatever you're into, get this.\n\nComplimentary recipe I mixed up and vaped like mad after the SFT:\n\n3% VTA Sugarloaf Pineapple\n\n1% VTA Passion fruit & Mango\n\n1% VTA Coconut","author":"RoninVX","title":"Passionfruit & Mango","url":"https://redd.it/qcspiw","vendor":{"name":"Vape Train Australia","code":"VTA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"VTA","title":"Passionfruit & Mango"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
