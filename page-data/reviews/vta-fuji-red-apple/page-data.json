Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Vape Train Fuji Red Apple, 1%, 4% and 8%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 41 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Sort of candied take on a red apple, but slightly fancy.  Like there may have been some actual apple juice involved at some point.  Feels pretty distinctly red, more red delicious than an actual fuji. Flat candied apple flavor, nothing that feels particularly realistic.\n\nTexturally, this is interesting.  It definitely doesn’t feel particularly juicy or fleshy.  Actual feels a bit dry, but it’s relatively thick.  Manages to avoid tasting like straight apple peels, which is kind of an issue with drier apple flavors.  Maybe tastes a bit flat, with that heavier base without too much vibrant in the top notes, but that could be a function of a relatively long steep.  A sweeter flavor overall, but stops just a bit short of being overwhelming or cloying.  Fairly accurate apple candy type of sweetness.\n\nSo comparing this to the other Fuji apples, I think this ends up being significantly different.  It has some of the juice of the CAP Fuji Apple, but in general this is less realistic than those.  Feels more like a generic red apple kind of flavor.  Probably closest to something like CAP Double Apple.  I feel like the Double Apple has a bit fleshier of a texture to it, but they both have that stronger candy apple vibe.\n\n**Off-Flavors:**  More of a candied take than the other fuji apples, but nothing unpleasant or odd.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light.  Pretty mellow for a candied fruit flavor overall.  Can get a bit dry at lower percentages, but seems to fill in and smooth out up higher.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 1%, this is basically vg with a light apple scent to it.  Seems way too weak down here.\n\nAt 4%, this is sort of thin, dry, and sweet.  Decent candy red apple flavor, but just doesn’t have much in the way of body or presence.\n\nAt 8%, this is working fairly well. Moderately dense apple base, although I’m not getting too much vibrancy in top notes.  Sweet but not quite obnoxious.  No real off flavors, feels like it could go a bit higher if you wanted to push it.\n\nVape Train suggests mixing with this at 3-5% or standalone at 7-12%.  Sure, why not?  Doesn’t seem like an especially aggressive flavor and not I’m getting anything off at higher percentages.  Just based on these tests, I’d be around 4% as an accent and up to 10% as a primary flavor.  Feels a bit dry for a solo flavor, but you could probably do worse for a single apple.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I’d use this more like the aforementioned CAP Double Apple than trying to work this in as a realistic apple flavor.\n\nReminds me a lot of manzanita del sol apple soda, and could be used over a juicier, relatively neutral fruit like CAP Fuji Apple or FA Pear to go after that apple soda kind of profile.\n\nI’d use it up against other fruits mostly, although it wouldn’t be bad in a cream or something when you’re looking for a relatively punchy candy apple flavor.  Should pair well with the usual suspects like watermelon, blueberry, and tarter stuff like pineapples.\n\nFeels a bit candied for bakeries in general.  Could be interesting as a shisha type apple flavoring in tobaccos.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  Not much on the google.\n\n[Here is the product page from Vape Train.  Their description: “an apple flavour similar to that of a cold pressed bold crisp apple juice. It’s mildly sweet without tartness or sourness found in VTA Green Apple.
