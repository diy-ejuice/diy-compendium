Vanilla cake? Cream.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Flavor Description:** This is a light and bright dessert, although very sweet it's not rich and heavy. On the inhale I'm getting a delicate juicy fruit, I think it's mango or something similar. Following that is a fluffy moist vanilla cake. It has a nice creamy note, almost like a whipped cream topping, it's not dense or heavy. There is a noticeable toasted back note similar to toasted marshmallow, which provides a great lightly baked affect to the cake. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:** Mango, lack of coconut.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit:** 5/10 I do get a moderate throat hit on this one.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Pairings:** Tropical fruits, paypaya, guava, banana, apple, nectarines, coconut. Cookies, cakes, creams, custards, lighter creamy nuts like almonds, tobaccos.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Notes:** So I'm a little confused by this one. It's a very nice flavor, but I'm not tasting any coconut, or a macaroon. This is the description from the website:\n\n \"This flavor is for those who enjoy extreme Coconut concentrations.\nFor Coconut lovers out there this will be one of your favorites! This Coconut macaroon type dessert/cookie is synonymous with paradise. Try it with other desserts or alone for an all day delight!\"\n\nWhat is get is a delicious white layer cake with a sweet mango filling that is frosted with fluffy whipped topping. With a unique toasted note.\n","author":"mysticrosell","title":"Paradiso","url":"https://redd.it/5s6hdq","vendor":{"name":"Purilum","code":"PUR"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"PUR","title":"Paradiso"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
