Moderately dense for a fruit flavoring, 5 out of 10. Very slight throat hit.                         \n      \n**Flavor Properties**- Crisp and juicy with the perfect sweet-tart snap,a very realistic Fuji apple, (I swear I can taste the skin of the Apple, and the sweet perfect fruit underneath) natural sugar flavor you'd expect from an apple without tasting artificial.\n\n**Relatable Flavors** - All in the name it's seriously like eating the perfect Fuji apple not a Granny Smith not a Golden Delicious just spot-on Fuji apple.\n\n**Off Flavors** - Slightly odd syrupy aftertast.\n\n**Position In The Recipe** - This is a top note or a fantastic base in any fruit recipe. Could also be used at very low percentages to add a sugar flavor.\n\n**Pairings**- The list goes on and on here, just open your collection look at every flavor you have and Fuji is going to pair up very nicely.\n\n*Please if your opinion differs, or you have another review for this post it in the comments this will help the master list with multiple views in one spot.*","author":"Chrisdvr1","title":"Fuji","url":"https://redd.it/4ofvz7","vendor":{"name":"Flavour Art","code":"FA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FA","title":"Fuji"}},
