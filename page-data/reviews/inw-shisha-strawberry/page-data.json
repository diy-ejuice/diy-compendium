It's like a mix of an artificial sweet strawberry, a natural strawberry, and has a sort of creamy or smooth texture to it. I remember hearing before purchasing this flavoring that it was the best strawberry out there, and that it's the only one you need; I disagree that it's the only one you need. It is great by itself as a strawberry, but I feel it benefits a lot from a slight strawberry ripe accent (depending on the recipe of course). It is weak for an INW flavoring, but falls in line with the same kind of potency as a lot of other flavoring companies such as TFA & CAP.\n\n**On the Nose**  \nA sweet strawberry with a slight ripe tone \n\n**Recommended Usage**  \n*Stand alone*: 5%\n\n*In a mix*: 1-4%\n\n**Throat**  \nMild\n\n**Pairings**  \nCreams, other strawberries, vanilla, marshmallow, cream cheese\n\n**Avoid**  \nCoffee, dark sweetness (i.e. butterscotch/caramel) \n\n**Steep**  \n2 days\n\n**Simple Recipe: Shisha Strawberry Cream**  \n*Ratio: 15PG/85VG* \n*Steep: 2 days* \n\n* INW Shisha Strawberry @ 4%  \n* INW Shisha Vanilla @ 3%  \n\nI mixed this up on a whim just because they were my two favorite ingredients at the time, and wanted to see how a \"Mustard Milk\" play on them would work. While not as successful as Mustard Milk, it is an enjoyable vape and really lets these two shisha flavorings shine, and gives you a great idea of what both of them bring to the table.  \n\n**Complex Recipe: Sweet Strawberry Cream**  \n*Ratio: 15PG/85VG* \n*Steep: 3+ days* \n\n* TFA Strawberry Ripe @ 3%  \n* FA Red Touch @ 0.5%  \n* INW Shisha Strawberry @ 2%  \n* TFA Vanilla Bean Ice Cream @ 3%  \n* INW Shisha Vanilla @ 1%  \n* LA Cream Cheese Icing @ 1%  \n* FLV Cream @ 1%  \n\nWhile INW Shisha Strawberry is the star here, you can see how the TFA Strawberry Ripe & FA Red Touch accent the INW to provide a ripe sweetness, and a touch more authenticity to the strawberry to really round out that strawberry profile.
