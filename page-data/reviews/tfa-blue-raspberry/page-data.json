It tastes like dirty black licorice and it smells like a blue pine-sol cleaning product. \nI mixed it at 8% solo with a touch of super sweet, was I very surprised when I first hit it. \nI then mixed a 4% blue razz with 8% raspberry sweet, better, except the delicious raspberry sweet was tainted by that dirty taste.\nI’ve heard that some people like it. I respect that, to each their own, although this was a very disappointing flavour for me.","author":"WolfImperator","title":"Blue Raspberry","url":"https://redd.it/aqwmpr","vendor":{"name":"The Flavor Apprentice","code":"TFA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"TFA","title":"Blue Raspberry"}},
