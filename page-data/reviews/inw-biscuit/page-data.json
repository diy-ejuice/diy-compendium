Notes of caramel, slightly nutty, and a savory property I can't quite put my finger on. ( may just be a combination of a well-balanced flavor )\n\n**Relatable Flavors**\n\nReminds me of a nice crisp biscotti, or vanilla wafer.\n\n**Position In The Recipe**\n\nBase, accent, or top note? I've seen this used in all three categories personally think it's it's best in the base. This is a  very versatile flavoring, and soom mite say its slightly overused.\n\n**Pairings**\n\nBakeries, creams, chocolates, berries, fruits, coconuts, tobacco's, some candies such as butterscotch or caramel, could even see this working with savory flavorings such as rosemary or zen garden.\n\n**Recipe**\n\n https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/7775#suger_cookies_and_cream_by_chrisdvr1\n\n**Notes**\n\nTypical mixing percentage is between .25 - .75 at different percentages, and with different pairings this can become different things, I really like the use of this as the ice cream cone in Wayne's SVBICC recipe.\n\nHere is a Wikipedia on biscotti and where you can find this flavoring.\n\n https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biscotti\n\n http://www.bullcityvapor.com/biscuit-concentrate-inw/\n\n**Rating** 100/100 \n\n*Please if your opinion differs, or you have another review for this post it in the comments. Will help the master list with multiple reviews in one spot.*","author":"Chrisdvr1","title":"Biscuit","url":"https://redd.it/4tdla5","vendor":{"name":"Inawera","code":"INW"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"INW","title":"Biscuit"}},
