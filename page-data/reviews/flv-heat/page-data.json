Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Heat @ 1% and 1 drop per 10 ml (about .25%), 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 11 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Bizzaro menthol basically.  Some really light, slightly sour kind of body but predominantly just a spicy heat without a flavor attached.  Throat hit feels a bit more like cinnamon than chili peppers, but it's a really clean spice note.  I can maybe, just barely, taste some cinnamon in here, but I'm pretty sure I'm imagining it based on the heat present and the way the throat hit is working.  I get spice on the inhale and through the entire vape, with it really ramping up on the back half of the exhale.  Usage percentage is all going to be personal taste. 1% is interesting and not overwhelming to me personally, but nothing tastes weird or off higher than that.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Nope. They say heat on the bottle, and that's pretty much all you get.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Yeah, but it's kind of the point. Spicy throat hit as opposed to chemical.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Use this to add spice and throat hit to a mix without really changing the flavor profile.  Interesting to use with fruits (especially tropical fruits), candies, creams, and beverages.\n\nThe throat hit is pretty nice as far as throat hit goes. I've heard people recommend using TPA Jalape√±o or something to add throat hit into juices without nicotine, and I think this would work better. Pretty solidly neutral flavor, with nothing chemical or weird.\n\n**Notes:**  Percentage use is going to really subjective.  No huge limiting factor besides your own spice tolerance. I get a clear heat accent at .25%, but it's not overwhelming at all.  If I had to tie it to a spice level, I'd go for like a Anaheim chile. 5% is starting to read as spicy to me.  1% is definitely present, and that throat hit is picking up. Maybe equivalent to like a Pasilla at this level. 1.5% is about the limit I'd personally want in a vape. Heavy throat hit and really clear spice.  About a typical mexican restaurant salsa level of spice here. 2% is still vapable for me, but not quite pleasant.  Just more spice and throat hit. 3% was a bad idea, but nothing really tastes off here.  I do think I taste some cinnamon here, but it's mostly spice and throat hit. For what it's worth, I'm not going flavor-blind on this.  Even after 10-ish mls at varying concentrations, I still get a clear spice here. \n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nNah, not really.\n\n[And here is the FLV product page. Their description: \"This is a flavorless warming sensation. It adds a spicy warm to hot taste, opposite the cooling effect of a menthol. \"](http://store.flavorah.com/concentrated-heat-flavor)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Heat","url":"https://redd.it/6az93u","vendor":{"name":"Flavorah","code":"FLV"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FLV","title":"Heat"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
