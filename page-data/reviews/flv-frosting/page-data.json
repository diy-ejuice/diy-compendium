Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Frosting @ 3%, 70/30 VG/PG, Steeped 2 weeks.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Thick, dense, smooth vanilla frosting.  At lower wattages there are butter-cream type frosting notes you'd get on a mid-grade wedding cake.  If you crank the wattage it starts to lose some nuance and it gets a even denser canned duncan-hines/pilsbury vanilla frosting, bordering on the mouthfeel you get from the marshmallows out of lucky charms.\n\n**Off-flavors:** None.\n\n**Throat Hit:** 1/10, really smooth after a steep.\n\n**Uses:**  The obvious one is frosting on bakeries.  Thick mouthfeel would lend itself to use as a thick, sweet vanilla for milkshakes or ice creams.  The lucky charms marshmallow texture would work great in cereal mixes, especially the milkier versions.\n\n**Pairings:**  Yellow cake, vanilla cupcake, Nonna's cake, CDS... you get the point. Cereals like CAP Cereal 27, FW Fruity Flakes. Tart citruses and other fruits for flavored frostings.  It's a blank slate.\n\n**Notes:**  I was skeptical about this, until I steeped it.  Lorann's Cream Cheese Icing is my closest competitor, but this has a much clearer vanilla note and I like the added volume here.  It's almost a really good marshmallow flavor. I'm sure how to wax more poetic about it, but it's pretty effective for a sweet, fluffy, vanilla frosting.\n\n[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Frosting","url":"https://redd.it/5b4hrn","vendor":{"name":"Flavorah","code":"FLV"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FLV","title":"Frosting"}},
