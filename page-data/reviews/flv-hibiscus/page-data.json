Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Hibiscus @ 1% and 1 drop per 10 ml (about .25%), 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 9 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  This is interesting. Green leafy base with a lighter floral edge to it.  Not even a passing resemblance to [CAP Hibiscus](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/5dhnoy/cap_hibiscus/), much closer to [FA Jasmine](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/5n1ksr/fa_jasmine/) with the mouthfeel of [FA Violet](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/5uop2a/fa_violet/) Solid, slightly powdery mouthfeel.  Heavily concentrated, and not really a flavor you want as a main note. I'd use this as a realistic fruit floral accent with some bonus solid mouthfeel, at maybe .1-.2%.\n\nInhale has a sharper floral note with a sweet powdery base. Floral note is hard to nail down exactly, but it's close to a jasmine where it's brighter and lighter than something like a heavier rose or geranium. Somewhere between fresh rain and warm spring air (I promise that isn't unduly trying to talk up the flavor, I'm just not a horticulturist here.)  Pretty solid, powdery base with a solid but not cloying sweetness.  Exhale has some pretty heavy green leaf notes right up front. It's more a bright green, so more in line with something like a cucumber rind than a swampy vegetal flavor. Higher floral top notes, same as the inhale.  Gets a little herbal shampoo-ish as low as .25%. Sweet, solid base with a dryer mouthfeel. A bit of lingering dryness and jasmine perfume.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  So this is more of a hibiscus flower than a hibiscus tea kind of flavor. Leaves and all.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Maybe a bit dry but nothing harsh.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I'd use it like FA Jasmine.  So it's mostly teas, and an additive to add some realism back to fruits.  I've used FA Jasmine to add a bit of pith back to citruses, and I think it will still work like that. I'd also use it for apples and pears to get that lightly floral edge back to a juicier base.\n\n**Notes:**  This is strong stuff. At .1%, I get mostly the floral part of this. The base is a bit thin but there is some lightly tart green leafiness to it.  Maybe a tiny bit of citrus sourness. .2% is a whole lot more solid, with that powdery base coming through pretty clearly. .5% seems a bit too floral and dry, like actually eating leaves instead of smelling them. 1% is not a good thing to do.  Don't do that.  I'd use this an accent at .1-.15% or as a stronger flavor in a tea at .2-.3%.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nNah, not really.\n\n[And here is the FLV product page. Their description: \"\nCrips and refreshing Hibiscus flower, goes very well with other fresh citrus and vegetal flavors like cucumber. Not overly aromatic, but crisp and light. The bright and clear top notes come out brilliantly when vaped.\"](http://store.flavorah.com/concentrated-hibiscus-flavor)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Hibiscus","url":"https://redd.it/6aoncf","vendor":{"name":"Flavorah","code":"FLV"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FLV","title":"Hibiscus"}},
