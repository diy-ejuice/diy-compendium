Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FW Mojito, 2 and 4%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 7 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Sugar with lime.  I can't find any mint in here, maybe a light bit of cooling on the exhale, but no real taste of mint. Nothing that tastes like rum. Just a sort of generically fruity white sugar taste with some lime in the background coming through clearer on the back end.  With all that sugar, the lime note tastes a lot like the lime from fruity pebbles.  Very sweet. I've got that DIY palate where sweetener tastes a little weird, but this is just stupid.\n\nInhale is sweet. Just sweet. Dry, grainy texture. Turns out vaping sugar syrup is like eating white sugar raw, at least texture wise. Some lighter lime building through the inhale, but that sugar is up front. Exhale tastes a lot like a bowl of dry green fruity pebbles. Lighter lime, no real zest. Dry grainy texture. Lots of sweetness. Heaps of white sugar.  Lime is a bit clearer right at the end, i can almost pick out a zest note. Maybe a hint of cooling?  Lingering sugar lips and a gnawing sense of regret.\n\nAlso worth noting that [FW's SDS for this has it listed at 15-25% sugar syrup](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/6pon5hhbk4aasnu/AAAlb_B4drZ2XyTnwsuf_RtTa/SDS?dl=0&preview=Mojito+Flavor+N%26A+FW-MJI.pdf)... so that's probably not good. Diketones are awesome, but the sugar syrup is probably a bridge too far.  Cancer cake is up at 20-30% fructose, so I guess it's no more unsafe than that?\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Most mojitos have some kind of simple syrup or sugar thrown in while muddling the mint. This has no mint, just simple syrup. So all that sugar, and then all that sugar being burnt.\n\n**Throat Hit:**    Light until the burned notes from your coil gunk show up.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  FW Cancer Cake kind of gets a pass on the fructose because it's delicious.  That one might be worth the health risk.  This just straight tastes like sugar. I wouldn't use it in a juice. Use it to sweeten your iced tea or something.  If the health risk doesn't bother you, then it's probably just not worth having to rewick multiple times a day.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, this seems linear. White sugar at 1%, light lime. More white sugar at 2%, lime is a bit less light. 3% is getting really solid and grainy. 4% is intensely sweet, more lime flavored sugar than sweetened lime. 5% is pretty much just burning.  Sweet, burnt, sugar with lime.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Here's the ELR Page. Multiple copies of the same review, so I'm unsure who to credit, but: \"Smells like margarita, but doesn't taste completely like one. A hint salty. Semi Sweet. Spits a fair bit off the RDA. Would get old quick as a Standalone. Ok but not great. Started Gunking up coils after 2nd drip. Not good.\"](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/1627)\n\n[Of course it has positive reviews on ECX. One person even suggests adding sweetener and calls it a margarita, another brings up the salt thing again. I don't get salt out of this.](http://www.ecigexpress.com/shop/diy-e-liquid/diy-e-liquid-flavors/flavor-west/flavorwest-sweet-flavors/mojito-by-flavor-west.html)\n\n[User \"DuaneNeveu\" offers a quick review on a FW roundup on ECF: \"Mojito / 10% / 4/5 / To my palate, this one's balanced nicely all by itself, but there's no reason you couldn't let this mingle with fruit too.\"](https://www.e-cigarette-forum.com/forum/threads/flavor-west-diy-flavor-review.408639/)\n\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**\n\nCurses to /u/ID10-T for suggesting this.
