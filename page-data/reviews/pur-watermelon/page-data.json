Dual SS Round Wire build at .5 ohms. 35 Watts. Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing** Purilum Watermelon @ 4%. 70/30 VG/PG base.\n\n**Flavor Notes** \n\nAfter hearing all this buzz lately about Purilums' watermelon possibly dethroning the LA Watermelon as the king of candy watermelons I had to take it for a test drive. I tend to take my watermelon pretty seriously so this was a bold statement but I put on my \"objective\" hat to dive into this review.\n\nOn the nose it certainly doesn't scream Jolly Rancher like LA Watermelon does or even TPA (to a lesser degree) for that matter. It smells softer and more realistic and somewhat reminds me of a more robust version of FA's red summer watermelon where you can sense the soft fibrous fleshy texture of the actual fruit. Some good realism but you also detect there is some good sweetness in there as well. I definitely do not get Jolly Ranchers like you get from LA Watermelon. I am beginning to suspect this is one of those \"hybrid\" part realistic and part candied flavors. \n\nInhale has a nice building sweetness with a grainy/fibrous texture that is pretty fleshlike-not quite as dry as FA. It combines to make somewhat of a \"mushy\" texture. It is not a bad thing but I don't know that I've run across a similar texture. There are some realistic watermelon notes in there but I am also getting something close to raspberry coming along for the ride. That sweet 'berry' like note is perhaps where some folks are getting the candy from this. I am getting something closer to a pumped up less realistic FA Watermelon. It seems like it will have more presence in a mix which has always been an issue with me using FA Watermelon. It has a nice natural sweetness to it perhaps as if it is more ripe. \n\nOverall it is a pretty nice watermelon flavor but I fail to see any comparisons to LA Watermelon which is straight watermelon hard candy with virtually not a hint of realism. I would say this Purilum is 70 percent realistic and 30 percent sweetness or as ID10-T might say, \"it has an identity crisis\". I would place it on the spectrum of watermelon somewhere between FA's and TPA's...leaning much closer to FA. Or if you isolated the watermelon in Flavorahs Wild Melon this might be close. It is a nice flavor overall but it doesn't immediately scream to me where I would use it.\n\n**Off Flavors** Not really getting any off flavors but I do get a subtle secondary berry note. \n\n**Throat Hit** Not getting anything unduly harsh. Bear in mind I vape relatively low wattage mid-ohm so can't say how it would react at high wattages.\n\n**Uses/Pairings** I could see this working in situations where you want a nice soft medley of fairly realistic melons. It would probably pair great with Flavorahs Wild Melons, INW Melon, Cap Cantaloupe. It might be a good booster to get FA's Watermelon to come alive better in a mix. Any fruits where you want some realism with a ripened sweetness. I just don't think it stacks up well as a straight candy and in my mind anyway, LA Watermelon can rest comfortably as the candy king in my mixing for now.\n\n","author":"SophisticatedHack","title":"Watermelon","url":"https://redd.it/6o77lp","vendor":{"name":"Purilum","code":"PUR"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"PUR","title":"Watermelon"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
