Some slight notes of cool whip in there, but not really a full on \"cool whip\" taste at either %. \n\n**Off-flavors:** Maybe a tiny bit of cheesiness on the exhale at 5%, but to me, it's negligible and probably wouldn't be present with other flavors added to it. \n\n**Throat hit:** Almost non-existent on the inhale, I'd give it a 3/10 on the exhale @5%.\n\n**Uses:**  Fluffing up a heavier cream, or adding milkiness to a cereal recipe. \n\n**Pairings:** Other creams, fruits, cereals, waffles.\n\n**Notes:** I don't really see this as a desirable standalone flavor, as it is rather boring by itself.  Seems to have a lot more flavor and throat feel on the exhale than on the inhale though. Most recipes may need another cream to help thicken or round out the flavor.\n\nEDIT: [Link to all of our flavor reviews in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)","author":"wh1skeyk1ng","title":"Whipped Cream","url":"https://redd.it/4o40oq","vendor":{"name":"The Flavor Apprentice","code":"TFA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"TFA","title":"Whipped Cream"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
