As for the smell, I get a faint whiff of peppermint (because creme de menthe is typically derived from peppermint or corsican leaves). Not much else to say about it, I reckon.\n\n**Taste:**\n\nTastes just like peppermint! There's a mild creaminess in the background, it's also a touch sweet. I don't get much or any boozy or alcoholic taste to it (creme de menthe is supposed to be a mint-flavored alcoholic beverage).\n\nThe mint is also very, very mild. I prefer my mints on the stronger side, to the point where it chills the back of my throat (INW Eucalyptus, <3). This one does not accomplish that. It's more on the lighter side.\n\n**Standalone/Mixer:**\n\nI believe this is more of an accent than a standalone. Wayne from DIYORDIE used it in Cuprian to great effect at 2%. Personally I would use it a lot higher. Then again, I do enjoy that chilling sensation myself. \n\nSomething to note also is that this flavor does not need much of a steep at all for its properties to shine. That makes it superior to TFA's version. \n\n**Pairings**\n\nFruits, desserts, maybe baccos...\n\n**Is it 4oz-worthy?**\n\nNot really, I think most people could do with a vial or 30mls of this.","author":"thedirtyprojector","title":"Crème de Menthe","url":"https://redd.it/5be30l","vendor":{"name":"Flavor West","code":"FW"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FW","title":"Crème de Menthe"}},
