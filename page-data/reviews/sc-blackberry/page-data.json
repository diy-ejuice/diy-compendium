If you have additional notes PLEASE share them.\n\n**Setup:** Narda Clone, Single coil  26g Kanthal @.7 ohms.  25W Power, Half wicked with Native Wicks Platinum Blend\n\n**Testing:** SC Blackberry @ 5%. 70/30 VG/PG, steeped 0 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  I got this flavor because of /u/thadentman's crackberry pie recipe on atf. I have TFA's version but I am a junkie and have to collect them all. I am glad I did! This is very different from tfa's as in it is very sweet, juicy and more a candied blackberry. It reminds me a lot of their grape flavor where it is like a jolly rancher or sucker\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Nothing\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Very smooth right off the bat\n\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I would use this in candies and juice box type recipes. I would stick with tfa blackberry for creams and custards but this is nice for cocktails or lighter fruit mixes where you want it to be sweet. \n\n\n**Notes:**\nThis is really good. At 2% you get a full, lip smacking flavor. I haven't steeped this at all so I am not sure how it will change, but if it is like most fruits, it won't change much.\n\n**Second Opinions:** [Someone on ELR said it needed a long steep to lose the perfumy notes](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/7474) but I think they must have been talking about fa blackberry because there is zero perfume in this whatsoever. \n\n[aforementioned crackberry pie](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/30877#crack_berry_pie_by_thadentman) by /u/thadentman. \n\n\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**\n\nIf you have different opinions on the flavor or any ideas on how to use it please post them in the comments.
