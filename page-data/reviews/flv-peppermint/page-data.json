Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Peppermint, .25, 1, and 3% 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 5 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Fairly strong and clean candy peppermint flavor. Light sweetness, heavy cooling. Nothing green, herbal, or too realistic.\n\nSweetness level here is actually pretty nice. There's a little bit of body and sweetness to keep this from getting too thin, but it stops short of a straight candy cane flavor anywhere above .25% where the cooling picks up a bit.\n\nFairly aggressive cooling.  Builds on the inhale and kind of rides out through the exhale. Pretty smooth mentholation with no odd sharpness or off notes.\n\nMore of a peppermint candy flavor, no herbal or actual peppermint leaf taste to it.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Nah, Pretty standard peppermint flavor. It feels a bit less candied than some that I've tried, but it's definitely a candy base instead of an herbal mint.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Yeah, but that's kind of the point with anything mentholated.  Fairly heavy mentholation here, but it's fairly smooth as far as those things go.\n\n**Percentage testing:** At .25%, the candy part of the peppermint sticks out a bit more against the lighter cooling. Not too heavy, or syrupy, but definitely a sweeter peppermint hard candy type of flavor.  There's some warmth and mouthfeel to it that provides an interesting contrast to the still pretty noticeable cooling.\n\nAt 1%, this is significantly more icy. There's maybe a bit more candy flavor underneath, but the cooling definitely steps to the forefront of the vape. Sweetness helps offset that aggressive cooling a bit.  I don't find the cooling overwhelming at all at this level.\n\nAt 3%, this feels like mostly cooling. Sharp mentholation but nothing tastes weird or chemical. Candy note is a light accent at the end.\n\nAnything with cooling is largely personal preference.  I haven't found any hard line with this where it stops working as a flavor, and it will probably get icy enough for most peoples tastes without any issues.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**    If I had to take a wild guess, this seems about triple strength from CAP Peppermint, and maybe double from FA and TPA.  Sweetness is less sweet than CAP, but pretty similar to FA and TPA.\n\nProbably not sweet enough for solo for a straight peppermint candy vape.  I think this should have a subtle enough candy to use as just a cooling note in fruit mixes without that candy taking over.\n\nCooling doesn't have any weird issues, should work relatively well with creams, marshmallows, and chocolates. \n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Peppermint","url":"https://redd.it/6zbw44","vendor":{"name":"Flavorah","code":"FLV"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FLV","title":"Peppermint"}},
