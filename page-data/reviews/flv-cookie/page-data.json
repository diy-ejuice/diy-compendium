It tastes nothing like a cookie. At least not one I've ever tried. There is no, that I can detect, acetyl pyrazine. Not the normal 'Cookie' notes we are use to. If you were hoping for a uber concentrated FA Cookie replacement this isn't it.  There are some baked notes but not the kind you would expect from a cookie. Almost like really dry cake without the moistness or savory richness. It does have a maple syrup taste noticeable at 3%. The exact same flavor you get from FLV Cupcake Batter but way more forward. Almost as if it was some type of maple cake/cookie. I can't really claim that it's a background note because it tastes like it's suppose to be the main flavor note. A slight creamy baked maple flavor is all i'm really getting from this.\n\n**Throat hit**: Nothing of note/ incredibly smooth. It does not have a normal dryness that you would expect a cookie type flavor to have.\n\n**Off-flavors**: Maple Syrup \n\n**Uses**: This flavor at 3% isn't incredibly strong as a single flavor. I can see this being used at 1.5% - 2% in a mix for more of a background note or supporting flavor. But honestly, I'm having a hard time figuring out when you would use this.\n\n**Notes**: I'm was more critical than I usually would be simply because of the price of this. I would never knowingly pay so much for a maple syrup flavor. I'm personally disappointed in this flavor but I encourage some else with more of a refined palate and creativity to give this a shot because maybe I'm missing something here.\n\n/u/Flavorah responded with the following to help explain what exactly this flavor profile this is supposed to fill. It explains a lot more as to why it tastes the way it does. \n\n> Sorry that it does not have the dry cookie you were looking for /u/chewymidget For cookie, it was supposed to be that moment when you add the brown sugar, vanilla and butter together with the flour, not the dryer already baked cookie. Our biscotti flavor is made to be more dry, and adding a nut like peanut butter or beer nuts can easily bring out the dryness but it is easier to layer those on top, then it is to go backwards from a dry note. Also, we didn't want this to be a chocolate chip cookie right out of the bottle, but if you want it to be I think it can be successfully added in. If we made it dry, I would expect people to say \"where's the chocolate chips?\"\n","author":"chewymidget","title":"Cookie","url":"https://redd.it/5wlu0i","vendor":{"name":"Flavorah","code":"FLV"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FLV","title":"Cookie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
