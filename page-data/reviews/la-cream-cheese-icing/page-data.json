At 3% standalone, it really pushes more towards frosting than icing.  Reminiscent of a jar of Betty Crocker rich and creamy white frosting.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Alcohol note initially which steeps out eventually.  The cheese note may be off putting or sour to some people at higher percentages, although I feel it adds to what the flavor is supposed to be.\n\n**Throat hit:** 4/10, smooth and dense.\n\n**Uses:**  Great for adding mouthfeel and thickness to cream bases.  Also nice for adding a sweet icing/frosting top to your favorite bakeries.  May work with yogurt flavors to add a more authentic dairy note too.\n\n**Pairings:**  Creams, cakes, cookies, coffee, cereal, yogurt, preferred fruits.\n\n**Notes:**   This flavor may require a bit longer steep time to develop true potential and evaporate the alcohol out.  A pretty useful flavor for many different aspects of a recipe depending on how you use it.\n\nEDIT: [Link to all of our flavor reviews in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)","author":"wh1skeyk1ng","title":"Cream Cheese Icing","url":"https://redd.it/58tokn","vendor":{"name":"LorAnn","code":"LA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"LA","title":"Cream Cheese Icing"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
