I would give it 9 out of 10. no throat hit.                            \n\n**Flavor Properties**-  Smooth and rich vanilla with a heavy Dairy, very buttery, and a well-balanced sweetness that really makes the vanilla pop.                     \n\n**Relatable Flavors** - Reminds me of vanilla custard ice cream. ( may even be a suitable substitution for vanilla custard v1 cap.)             \n      \n**Off Flavors**- Not really finding anything here.\n\n**Position In The Recipe** -  High percentages this should make a great top note, and due to its dense mouth feel should fit into a base nicely. \n\n**Pairings** - Bakeries, chocolates, most fruits, tobacco's, nut flavorings, and other creams and ice creams.","author":"Chrisdvr1","title":"French Vanilla Crème","url":"https://redd.it/4nwp6h","vendor":{"name":"The Flavor Apprentice","code":"TFA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"TFA","title":"French Vanilla Crème"}},
