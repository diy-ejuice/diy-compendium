Very slight grain/oat back note.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Flavor Description:** Wow. Crispy cereal with crunchy strawberry marshmallows. The mouth feel seems great on this. I don't know if it's because the flavor is so authentic that it's playing tricks on me, or if it's really there. Can't wait to hear from others about this one. I haven't found a rice krispie or oat cereal I like yet. They all seem overly grainy and gross to me. This one doesn't, it has just a faint hint of grain, enough to say cereal without screaming oats! The cereal is equally balanced with the marshmallows, which are those crunchy artificially flavored strawberry cereal ones, not the fluffy type. This hasn't changed much from the shorter steep. The flavors are still pretty much as described before, maybe blended a little more? I'm almost getting a tiny creaminess from it that I didn't notice before. I'm not sure if it's there or not, my taster might be on overload right now 8-)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:** None\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit:** 1/10\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Pairings:** Milk or cream? Sweet cream?\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Notes:** This is probably the best marshmallow cereal I have tried to date. Authentic without being overwhelming in the oats. It's a mild-medium strength at this percentage. I think for a single flavor, or even with creams I would go to the 8-10% range. Since this changed very little with the longer steep, this will probably be good as a S&V or close to, but I didn't try until 4 days.\n","author":"mysticrosell","title":"Strawberry Marshmallow Cereal","url":"https://redd.it/6dkofj","vendor":{"name":"Purilum","code":"PUR"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"PUR","title":"Strawberry Marshmallow Cereal"}},
