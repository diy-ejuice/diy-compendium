It smells like sweet watermelon with a bit of lemon and Haribo balla-balla jellies, if you know what I mean. If you smell 'em, you'll know!\n\n\n**Throat hit** is quite strong with this one, but I could feel that way because I changed the coil night before this test. Old one was.. well, really old! Strong throat hit is not uncommon with INW concentrates, though. And I like that.\n\n**The taste** is consistent with how it smells. It's lightly sweet, but it's also refreshing. You get that taste like when drinking a cucumber-lemon drink, it's quite distinctive, but really delicate. I was kind of worried that it'd taste also like a watermelon, and it does. Like a watermelon candy. Moreover, I can taste ICE. By ice, a mean menthol, it adds this fresh and cold feeling on the throat. I really like that effect.\n\nUses and pairings: I would vape it solo, but I also tried it with some of the INW's new citrus concentrates and it worked out nice, so you can boost the freshness factor further by adding something like that. If you're a menthol guy/gal, you can add some more of that, too.\n\nPersonal testing notes: 30 drops per 30 ml is actually too much. Next time I'd go with 15-20.\n\n**Summary:** This is a pre-premiere, a tasting phase of new INW concentrates. I don't know if this one will make it onto the market, but I'd like it if it did. It's a nice, refreshing concentrate, but it doesn't exactly taste like a cucumber. They also provided me with a solo cucumber concentrate, so I'll try that and let you guys know.\n\n**Questions:** DM or mrgvape@gmail.com.\n\n**Disclaimer:** I wasn't paid to write this review. It's my personal hobby that I do in my free time. And one more thing. I don't have the pallette of a renowned chef or wine taster. I'm a simple man with simple taste buds, so my reviews are mostly suited for regular vapers who do not need advanced equipment and just want to know how something tastes. It's not my style to write something like this \"it tastes like a cucumber gently brushed by sunrays in western Europe and then cut into thin pieces with the finest knife. It reminds me of my childhood in Algeria, where I longed for a cucumber like this.. When it hits your tongue, you feel all kinds of emotions, starting with joy and sole happiness, but then you're overwhelmed with this great, cucumber-caused clarity... Life is great.\" Nope. It's watermelony cucumber.
