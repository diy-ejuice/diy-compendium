Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Horchata @ 1% and 1 drop per 10 ml (about .25%), 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 14 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Horchata relatively heavy on the cinnamon. Good clean cinnamon note, but it's a bit aggressive compared to the lighter taste of the creamy rice milk base. Good body, and the cream and rice here is tasty, just taking a bit of a backseat to the cinnamon.  Seems a bit harsh but not unbearable. Really needs a bit of cream backup.  I'd use this at 1.5% with a cream to smooth it out for a primary note or .5% as a cinnamon accent in bakeries.\n\nInhale has richer cinnamon up front, with a deeper creamy base.  Some light rice nuttiness here, but the cinnamon washes it out a bit. Moderately dense and just a bit dry, with a pretty realistic tasting sweetness level.  Exhale is creamier and fuller.  Higher realistic cinnamon notes, not quite as dry as a full bakery cinnamon but still quite a bit of body. Creamier base is pretty neutral at first, but picks up a light rice character towards the end of the exhale. Still dead on for sweetness, with a fairly thick mouthfeel. Some harshness here, as the cinnamon is just a bit too aggressive for the base and dries out the vape a bit. Lingering cinnamon and a bit of rice nuttiness.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Nah, nothing that shouldn't be there.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Moderate.  I'm getting a bit of chest tightness along with some harshness on the back of the throat. I will say this definitely needs a bit of a steep to calm down.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Solo, I feel like the cinnamon level here is dead on for a horchata.  I think this could stand a bit of cream to smooth this out and maybe a hit of that new-fangled FE Sweet Rice to really push the rice here.\n\nOutside of a horchata dominant vape, Flavorah suggests using this in bakeries, and I could see that. The cinnamon note here is actually pretty mellow but still fairly realistic, and that body and light nutty note from the rice is going to blend well to add volume and cinnamon to your bakeries.  It obviously needs a steep, but mixing this at 1% with 2% FA Apple Pie seems to have serious promise.\n\n**Notes:** S&V concentration testing, this isn't crazy strong. At .25% I get a clear body but not a whole lot of flavor. Some light cinnamon and just a hint of cream. .5% has a pretty identifiable cinnamon, but still not much creaminess. 1% is good, with a balanced slightly dry bakery cinnamon note and a denser cream body with a tiny bit of that nutty rice milk flavor especially towards the tail end of the exhale. 1.5% has more cinnamon to it.  Still not completely blowing the rest of the vape out but it's getting a bit prominent. Rice note is a bit more pronounced as well. 2% is heavy on the cinnamon for me, washing out some of the nuance of the rice milk part of the vape. 3% isn't really working for me. Too much cinnamon. I'd use this a primary horchata note with some cream or rice backup at 1.5%, and an additive for bakeries at .75-1%.\n\nI haven't ever got on the horchata vape train, so I can't really comment on how this compares to other available horchata concentrates. I will say, for this being my first horchata concentrate, I'm not mad at it, and I could see how people are into vaping that profile.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nAgain, not a whole lot.\n\n[Here is the FLV product page. Their description: \"Creamy cinnamon with milky smoothness… If you are not familiar with this refreshing Latin American drink, then you owe it a try the next time you have a chance. Before then, try our horchata. It’s a blend of the flavors of starchy rice pudding and a rich warm cinnamon. Mixes well with bakery flavors. \"](http://store.flavorah.com/concentrated-horchata-flavor)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Horchata","url":"https://redd.it/6bjlu9","vendor":{"name":"Flavorah","code":"FLV"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FLV","title":"Horchata"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
