On [Noted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOtu7lUZgFo&t=4742s), u/Fear suggested letting the flavors steep longer and I'm wondering if I'm just not letting them steep enough to make an accurate review. His suggestion was 1% and to let it steep a 'couple of weeks'. Thus far, 2% seems enough to get a taste that will be distinguishable. Some seem like a strong enough stand alone to warrant higher tests like SC/FE Turkish and some like SC Black Mile seem like they could use a little experiment here or there much lower. Maybe these will steep into flavors too strong.\n\nAt 9 days, 2.5 seems like not enough for this one. It's a light flavor and already notably sweet and maybe even a little perfumey. Not like grandma's bathwater perfumey but there's definitely something lingering here that I'm not really enjoying. The expected nuttiness isn't really more than the barest of hints. My point of comparison would be INW 555 Gold which I haven't tested in ages, maybe 2017? I had high hopes for a nice nutty tobacco and this definitely isn't it. Overall, this is striking me more of a golden syrup ry4 flavor than an actual tobacco flavor. The sweetness is just so strong. Of all my tests thus far, I've finished 30mL of each and I'm struggling to make it through this one. I keep eyeing the bottle to see when this will end. It's not a bad or unpleasant flavor, it just definitely isn't what I want in a tobacco. It's too dense, cloying and sweet for me to warrant trying it again much higher to get a better sense of what lies beneath. I can say that I would only recommend this to people who like RY4 or think that RY4 is almost too much tobacco for them. I could maybe see using this in the place of VT Golden Syrup... if I ran out of it. And I hated myself. Ok, I kid, but really this just isn't my bag. I kind of put this in the Tatanka category but without the distinctive chewing tobacco dark richness.\n\n*Suggested percent:* 2-3 main note (I'm afraid to push it any higher out of both not liking what I have tasted thus far or because of that weird perfumey off note), 1% accent.  \n\n*Pairing ideas:* I guess I would want to pair this with something actually nutty. My preference would be like a little Red Burley and then something to dry it all up a little like a fuck ton of Cured. If I wanted to soak up some of that sugar, maybe pair it with FLV Virginia and then add some INW Vanilla for Pipe and some kind of actual nut to play off it's golden sweetness, like TPA Dx PB. That stuff is nice and dry. Maybe something like:\n\n[Bacco Blend No. 1 (Gold Arabian nut vanilla tobacco)](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/share/c161cb3a-4808-49cf-8954-a9bd79632208)\n\n Or just lean in entirely and go: \n - FA Soho 6%\n - SC 555 3%\n - WF Hazelnut and Cream 1.5%\n - TPA RY4D 2%\n\nWanna know the strange truth? I kinda want to pair this with Strawberry. Which Strawberry do you think would pair well with, say, golden syrup?  \n\n**Second Opinions**: \n[Noted Review on 5's and 7's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV2DpkCC2_k&t=1375s)\nu/ID10-T was peddling creamy roasted peanuts and u/Duncanyoyo1 said he got more of a \"leafy, commercial style tobacco\" at 2%.\n\nUnsurprisingly there were maybe three private recipes on ATF that used it and on ELR there were about 60 recipes under SC or FE 555.\nELR user KumariHPX did their homework when they added these notes:\n\n> Vaping Zone Reviews of SC-555 Super Concentrated Flavor  \nHaven't tried this alone yet as I mix it equal parts with Blackberry for a wonderful flavor. Also I will add a few drops of this mix to top off my current atomizer that will cream and balance other flavors already being vaped.  \nReview by MaxPosted on 10/22/18  \nThe only flavor that I've seen that was capable to turn on people that wasn't into vaping. Everyone says it's the closest experience to cigarretes.  \nReview by Pablo RochaPosted on 10/22/18  \n100% carole burroughs  \nThis is by far my favorite cig flavor. It has nutty tones with kind of a sweet end to it.  \nI do just a drop more than 2.5 percent but no more.  \n60% vaprvixn  \nThis is NOT 555. This is a lot like the Real Cig flavoring. It has a heavy perfume note in it and only a light tobacco note. I really don't care for this flavor much, but I've used it in conjunction some other tobaccos and fruit and flowers. It works okay with light tobacco flavors, but by itself it is not good.  \nReview by Posted on 10/22/18  \nRating  \n100% Ole Harald Skogen  \nVery nice nutty tobacco.  \nWorks great with caramel, cream, hazelnut and vanilla. Best tasting combo I've tried.  \n100% Richard Grover  \n555 flavor the best you can buy. Just mix at 2.5%  \n100% Millie D  \nDark and rich flavor a personal favorite.  \n100% Kathryn Steffens  \nAfter steeping for 10 days. I got to say this stuff is really good. I made it at 2% 60pg /40 vg. I like lite flavoring, because my taste buds are sensitive. This 555 is subtly nutty, with a great tobacco taste behind it. Not the \"gag\" it's too strong flavor. But a mild \"all day\" vape kind.\n\n## Final Thoughts\nI dunno, man, I dunno... I'm going with vaprvixn here. I got some perfume and no nut november all month long. I did find it interesting that there was at least one mention of pairing it with fruits and the hazel cream vanilla combo showed up at least once as well. In the end, I would not recommend this flavor unless for the deep diver. INW 555 Gold is much better as a 555 and Gold Ducat or Tatanka are much better flavors for this kind of syrupy goodness without all the mediocre weirdness. I dont want to knock it completely, I did make a recipe out of it with red burley noted above with a bit of arabian and it was an extremely enjoyable mix. I'd be inclined to say that the FLV flavors did the heavy lifting but the 555 did pull them in a unique way that was exciting to my senses having over used those flavors for too long.","author":"isuamadog","title":"555","url":"https://redd.it/rd59lr","vendor":{"name":"Super Concentrated","code":"SC"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"SC","title":"555"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
