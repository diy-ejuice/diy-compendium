    "result": {"data":{"reviewsJson":{"markdown":"**Setup:** Velocity clone; dual twisted 24awg Ni/28awg kanthal @ .27Î©; cotton wicks; 55 W\n\n**Testing:** Super Concentrate Red Apple @ 3%; Aged: 4 weeks\n\n**Flavor description:**  Starts off as a lightly spiced, nearly over-ripe, soft, juicy red apple, sweeter than Red Delicious but not quite as sweet as a Braeburn apple.  After the 2 to 3 week mark it starts to lose a bit of brightness, becoming more of a light syrupy apple taste while still holding the subtle apple pie spice note.  The spice part slightly resembles a sweet clove/pine note for lack of better description.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Every once in a while this gives me a hint of a over-ripe or bruised apple, not exactly a deal-breaker though.\n\n**Throat hit:** 6/10, starts off a bit harsh but seems to mellow out after a few puffs.\n\n**Uses:** 1-3% to give a layer of depth to existing fruits.  This might need to be pushed to 4-6% to be a main note, but keep in mind some stronger flavorings might take over this rather delicate taste.\n\n**Pairings:**   FA Fuji, fleshy or stone fruits, cinnamon, light pastry or crust type flavors, lighter tobaccos.  I can see FA Meringue or another sweet light cream-type flavor helping this one out as well, however I think a thicker cream is going to mute this out unless a higher (5+) percent is used.\n\n**Notes:** I would try to avoid pairing with citrus unless you are using this as an accent or supporting flavor.  It likely won't stand up to dark or bold flavors, as it is rather delicate and meek.  Choose cream pairings wisely.\n\n[Link to all of our flavor reviews in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)\n\nSuper Concentrate flavors are available at Bull City [here.](http://www.bullcityflavors.com/super-concentrates/)  ","author":"wh1skeyk1ng","title":"Red Apple","url":"https://redd.it/5ofh6q","vendor":{"name":"Super Concentrated","code":"SC"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"SC","title":"Red Apple"}},
