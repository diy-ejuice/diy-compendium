This is a very good strength at 1.5% at 3 days. If the flavor strengthens with a longer steep, I might have to reduce it to 1%, but it's great at 3 days. I made the mistake of mixing the first batch of this with sweetener, thinking of those “other” chocolates I had tried. It was sickening, had to dump and remake. I recommend trying without sweetener first, then start small if you want more sweetness. Tastes and smells exactly like the name. Imagine you have just stirred that mix with 50 spoon strokes, then scraped the batter into the pan. Then you use your finger to clean the bowl of that delicious, rich, gooey, chocolaty goodness. And it's not that weak chocolate brownie mix, oh noooo. This is the deluxe Fudge Brownie Mix batter. So this and rich you can practically feel it coating your tongue mmmmmmmm. Oh, ummmm, where was I at?\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOh yes, it really is that good. Just buy it. Sweet, fudgy, chocolaty, uncooked brownie batter. Nice thick mouth feel even at 3 days. I can honestly say this is the first chocolate flavor I have found that I like. My only caveat would be that this is so realistic and rich that I can't ADV it. Gets sickening after a while, just like if you have really eaten too much batter. It's been great for around 3 hours at a time, or whenever I get a sweet tooth. And with coffee, definitely with coffee. I will update at the 4 week steep.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Steep Time:** 4 Week\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAt a 4 week steep, this has weakened and had flavor loss similar to what lemon does. I still get the brownie flavor, but it's not as strong and has lost that fudgy rich flavor and the thick mouth feel is completely gone. I am going to skip this right up to 3%, which means it will be way too strong before steeping. But testing to see if it can hold on to more flavor with a steep. Otherwise, this would make an incredible S&V after 24 hours. I wouldn't make more than a week's worth or so at a time, so as to not lose that realistic fudgy richness that makes this flavor so good during the first week.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAt a 3-7 day steep I would rate this 5 stars as it's perfect, and this will probably be one I keep as a S&V. At a 4 week steep I would give it 3, unless the stronger percentage helps hold the flavor. It still tastes good and like brownie batter, but a weaker version compared to how gooey and intense it is in that first week.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nEDIT: Real Flavors has announced they will be changing the names of their Raw Extracts to Super Concentrates.","author":"mysticrosell","title":"Brownie SC","url":"https://redd.it/55shdd","vendor":{"name":"Real Flavors","code":"RF"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"RF","title":"Brownie SC"}},
