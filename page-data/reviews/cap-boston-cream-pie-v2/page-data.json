Exhale weak bakery notes, very rich cream, chocolate taste darker than the inhale. Lingering caramel and vanilla notes.\nOff-flavors: Inhale every so slightly alcoholic\nThroat hit: None\n\nUses and pairings: I cannot imagine working it with strong fruit or citrus flavors, maybe blueberry. Adding grain (Sugar Cookie Cap, Cookie Fa, Biscuit IW) could work very well, as a Boston Cream Pie should have some. Coconut would do as well. It could be used to accentuate creamy vapes that lean on chocolate.\nNotes: I do not know V1, I would have expected it needs Diketones, but it works as V2 and is rich and  creamy.  \nThat being said, i feel this is a good flavour as is but hard to mix with trying to change the profile to much, it would be better suited to make it a near perfect boston pie/donut than incorporating it in a mix.","author":"ihatetoridethebus","title":"Boston Cream Pie V2","url":"https://redd.it/5xtw2o","vendor":{"name":"Capella","code":"CAP"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"CAP","title":"Boston Cream Pie V2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
