It's like I'm vaping rose petals. \n\nAt 0.5% it's mild. Think water with hints of rose.\n\nAt 1% it's very enjoyable. Very accurate rose petal flavor. \n\nAt 1.5 % it starts getting a touch perfume/potpourri like. \n\n**Off flavors:** No real off flavors here. Just a little bit of perfume/potpourri like flavor at 1.5%. Slightly noticeable, but not horrible.\n\n**Throat hit:** Non existent.\n\n**Pairings:** This has a lot of potential as an accent flavoring. Definitely with teas, tobaccos, bakeries, fruits and candies. I imagine it working with creams and yogurts too. \n\n**Conclusion:** It's a really good rose flavor. Don't know if I'd want to go above 1.5%, it might become overwhelmingly perfume like. Curious to see how it steeps. Tossed 0.5% in my baklava recipe and it came out nice. I'm looking forward to mixing it with the pairings I mentioned. \n\n**Second opinions:** No notes on ELR or ATF.\n\n**Ingredients:** Biobased vegetable derived PG, natural rose flavor.","author":"Morgan_Drury","title":"Rose","url":"https://redd.it/hgez10","vendor":{"name":"Medicine Flower","code":"MF"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"MF","title":"Rose"}},
