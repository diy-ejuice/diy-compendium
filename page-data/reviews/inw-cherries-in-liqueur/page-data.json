Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** INW Cherries in Liqueur, 3 and 6%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 9 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  A cherry and chocolate flavored liqueur.\n\nI don't get an overwhelming cherry out of this.  It seems like a darker cherry flavor, not like a bright red maraschino cherry.  I don't get anything too overtly realistic out of this, it's feeling a lot like the kind of slightly dry, thin kind of cherry vibe like from INW Cherries, albiet a bit closer to a black cherry.  I feel like I'm not picking up a real cherry body, just some cherry flavor.  Same kind of familiar cherry off-notes here, but it isn't overwhelming at least in balance with everything else going on here.\n\nIn terms of the liqueur part of this, I'm going back and forth a bit.  I do think there is some kind of booziness in here, but it feels like an artificial kind of spiced rum flavor.  No specific spice sticks out and it's a bit hard to pick out a discrete alcohol note with some of the cherry off-notes floating around.\n\nI also get a good deal of chocolate here.  Checking the second opinions, I might be picking it up a bit more than other people or something here is just hitting me weird.  Overall the concentrate reminds me a lot of a cheap cherry cordial candy somehow made into a liqueur.  The chocolate is more like a medium-dark cocoa note without any kind of waxy or rich body.\n\nMouthfeel overall feels a bit thin and dry for something that should have a pretty heavy liquid component.\n\nThis is fairly dark and the chocolate thing makes me worry a bit about coil gore.  I'm getting a bit of muting and some muddiness to the flavor, but I haven't noticed anything that seems like burning.  FWIW, I'm thinking INW Cherries in Liqueur and INW Cherry Liqueur are the same thing.  I can't find any references to a specific INW Cherry Liqueur on the Inawera storefronts.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Chocolate.  A pretty sizable amount of chocolate.  If this is liqueur I'd guess it's a chocolate liqueur. Not a bad thing per se, but a pretty substanial contribution to the profile.  At higher percentages I do pick up some plasticy cherry off notes, but they're relatively subtle compared to other cherry concentrates at comparable strengths. \n\n**Throat Hit:**  Moderate.  Overall just a bit harsh and dry for me.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 1%, I'm not getting much cherry.  There's a bit of it, but it feels like it's being drowned out a bit by some of those boozy notes.  Not quite plasticy but it's sort of thin and bitter. I pick up a good bit of that chocolate on the tail of the inhale and the exhale.\n\nAt 2.5% there's a clearer cherry for here, and I'm getting some good cherry sweetness and a darker, not too cloying cherry flavor.  The booze notes here seem a bit toned down, but I'm feeling like the off-notes from the cherry are coming out a bit more. Fairly strong darker cocoa here for me.\n\nJust based on these tests, I'd probably go around 1.5-2% in mixes where the chocolate and cherry are a fit for the profile.  I feel like the cherry and the chocolate are pretty well intertwined and will be distracting if you want one but not the other.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Pretty good solution for getting some cherries and chocolate together.\n\nSeems like a really good fit for anything that is supposed to use a cherry cordial, maybe with some additional cream or something like FW White Chocolate to fill out that darker cocoa note and a juicier red berry to fill out the cherry note.\n\nI could also see this working really well in a black forest cake recipe.  Actually a pretty stand in for kirsch if the profile will handle the chocolate.\n\n**Second Opinions:** [Here's the ELR Page.]  No mention of chocolate, so maybe I've completely lost it.

Meant to buy Cherries... but this one is quite nice! (maybe not in the icecream). It has something that makes me want to throw it into a tobacco, chocolate or coffee rather then fruits, candy or softdrinks. A taste for grownups. Maybe its the liqueur-part that makes that darkness.\"\n\n[Here's the review from the Inawera review page by \"Aurora-Oblivion\" on ECF that's been hanging around for a while:](https://www.e-cigarette-forum.com/forum/threads/inawera-flavor-review-45-flavors-from-inawerashop-add-yours-too.546838/)\n\n\"4 drops per 5ml was too weak to properly describe flavor, increased that to 7 drops per 5ml then waited another 14 days to taste again. I detect dark rum (?) soaked cherries. Not quite sure on the liqueur used here, but to me it tastes kind of like a dark non-spiced rum, cherry flavor is not \"popping\" out at me, but more of a lightly blended cherry into the dark rum/alc taste. And I do believe I detect a VERY faint tobacco note in there as well possibly.\n\nAbove average TH for this one. This would be great mixed into a alcohol type drink, or a citrus mixed type drink like MT Dew or Hypno, and I'm sure this would be a welcomed addition to a dark pipe style tobacco as well!\"\n\n[Here's a review from user \"Bryan123456\" on Planet of the Vapes](https://www.planetofthevapes.co.uk/forums/product-reviews/flavour-concentrate-reviews/beverages/threads/cherry-liqueur-inawera.4626/) that starts out talking about someone's aunt getting drunk, but it does contain the following: \"There’s a lovely exhale with a cherry note and I like this very much. It’s vapeable from 4 drops into 5ml (1.6%). I went up to 12 drops (4.6%) and it was sooo cherryish. I finally mixed this up at 6% and then soused it with sweetener and got the De Kuyper thing.\"\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Cherries in Liqueur","url":"https://redd.it/757zv4","vendor":{"name":"Inawera","code":"INW"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"INW","title":"Cherries in Liqueur"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
