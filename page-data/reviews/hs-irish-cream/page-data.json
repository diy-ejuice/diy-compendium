Slightly eggy, very buttery, and a very light sweet note.\n\n**Relatable Flavors** -  Honesty this is like no Irish cream I tasted before,  there's none of the warmth you expect from an alcohol flavor, and nothing like Bailey's Irish Cream.\n\nIt's like drinking a glass of heavy cream with almond butter and coco butter whit just a touch of vanilla.\n\n**Off Flavors** - Almost imperceptible\nChalky flavor with a lingering aftertaste.\n\n**Position In The Recipe** - Being that it is so dense my opinion is that it belongs in the base. \n\n**Pairings** - Other creams, and ice creams,  coffee's, chocolates, vanilla's,    the whole list of nut flavorings, ( I'm interested in trying it with pistachio ) spice  flavorings like horchata. Try adding a alcohol flavoring such as Kentucky bourbon to finish off the perception of an Irish Cream.","author":"Chrisdvr1","title":"Irish Cream","url":"https://redd.it/4mvtdd","vendor":{"name":"Hangsen","code":"HS"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"HS","title":"Irish Cream"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
