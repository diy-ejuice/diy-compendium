This is a extremely realistic flavoring and has fantastic umami.\n\n**Relatable Flavors**\n\nThis is a completely unique flavoring and dead on perfect representation fresh basil. If I was trying to describe it without saying basil I would say it's like mint without the mint if that makes any sense at all.\n\n**Off flavors**\n\nNothing really off here but it is worth mentioning requires a long steep at least 10 days before that green flavor like fresh-cut grass dissipates.\n\n**Position In The Recipe**\n\nShould work well as a base note in any savory recipe, or a top note in any sort of dessert or Bakery recipe.\n\n**Pairings**\n\nCreams, tobacco's, other savouries such as Rosemary,spice flavorings, and bakeries.(I think you'd be really surprised how awesome a little basil is on a donut.)\n\n**Recipe**\n\nhttps://alltheflavors.com/recipes/7876#creamy_tomatum_soup_by_chrisdvr1\n\n**Notes**\n\nI tested this at 0.8% first with about a month long steep and was surprised I really couldn't taste the flavor.\n\nHere is a Wikipedia on basil if you're interested in learning, more and where are you can buy this fantastic flavor.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basil\n\nhttp://www.bullcityvapor.com/zen-garden-fa/\n\n**Rating** 98/100\n\n**Please if your opinion differs, or you have another review for this post it in the comments.
