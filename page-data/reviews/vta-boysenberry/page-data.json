Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Vape Train Boysenberry, 1%, 4% and 8%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 33 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Dark berry candy.  Might be a boysenberry?\n\nThis tastes a bit generic, but it could definitely be a boysenberry.  It’s maybe a bit tarter than a blackberry but doesn’t taste much like a raspberry.  Easy “boysenberry” math checks out, then.  More artificial than realistic berry flavor.  At higher percentages, gets fairly saturated and sweet, but the mouthfeel doesn’t really turn over into syrupy.  \n\nThat candy thing is reinforced by the texture here.  This seems kind of full and fluffy.  At higher percentages, it definitely has a bit of marshmallow mouthfeel.  I think I’m picking up a bit of extra vanilla in here too.  Vague FA Oba Oba esque kind of effect.  The sweetness of the berry and that texture pushes this toward a candy berry profile pretty hard.\n\nStill manages to be a bit floral though, and at higher percentages those florals get a little bitter and perfumey with almost a chemical edge to them.\n\nThe base of this flavor seems awfully similar to [Vape Train’s Blackberry](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/85319m/vape_train_blackberry/)  This doesn’t have that more realistic blackberry note, but it has that same kind of generic dark berry candy type base to it.  Comparing this to FLV Boysenberry, the FLV version doesn’t have any of the light floral edge and is syrupy and richer where this has a bit of fluffier marshmallow-esque texture.\n\n**Off-Flavors:**  There’s some vanilla in here.  Not overwhelming, but at least noticeable at higher percentages.  Lighter bitter floral edge, tastes a bit chemical.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Moderate.  This can get a bit harsh.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 1%,  I’m getting a pretty full complement of the florals here and a really light actually berry flavor.  Actually seems a bit savory here?  Which is odd?\n\nAt 4%,  the berry is fuller and not really more floral.  Very light tartness. Texture is starting to pick up some fluffy texture, and I get just the slightest hit of vanilla.\n\nAt 8%,  this is pretty fluffy overall.  Texture is pushing towards marshmallow. Berry is heavier and sweeter, with a floral slightly chemical edge.\n\nVape Train suggests mixing with this at 2-5% or standalone at 5-9%.  I’m a little more restrained than that.  Just based on these tests, I’d be closer to 3% mixed, and 5% as a primary flavor.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  The fluffier candy texture here is going to limit this one a bit.   I’d mostly stick to candies in general, as that fluffiness is going to be a bit weird in a fruit mix.  Could work at an accent percentage with creams or custards.  Not really realistic enough for bakery applications.\n\nKind of hard to recommend based on other available dark berry options.\n\n**Second Opinions:**   I can’t find anything via google.\n\n[Here is the product page from Vape Train.  Their description: “a juicy dark berry flavour that’s very versatile in many e-liquid recipes. This flavour pairs well with Apple, Lemon, Lime, Mango, Melon, Nectarine, Peach, Pear, Raspberry, Rhubarb and Strawberry. Popular blends include boysenberry and ice-cream, smoothies and heavy creams blend really well with this flavour profile as do candies, dessert, yogurts, dairy, bakery, and beverage style e-liquids recipes.”  So everything again, basically?”](https://www.vapetrain.com.au/shop/vt-concentrates/boysenberry-flavour-concentrate-diy-for-e-liquid-recipe/)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Boysenberry","url":"https://redd.it/86amem","vendor":{"name":"Vape Train Australia","code":"VTA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"VTA","title":"Boysenberry"}},
