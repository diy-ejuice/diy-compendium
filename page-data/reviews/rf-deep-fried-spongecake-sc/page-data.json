Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** RF SC Deep Fried Spongecake @ 2% and 4%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 14 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Twinkies.  Lighter yellow/sponge cake with a lightly fried edge (or just slightly caramelized) and a softer vanilla cream. Really tasty, if a bit light overall. Tends to get darker as opposed to more saturated as you crank up the flavor. Another full profile from Real Flavors, but I could also see using this as a substitute for something like a yellow cake flavor.  I'd mix with this around 3%.\n\nInhale has filling up front.  Sweet, a bit on the light side but pretty accurate to twinkie filling. Some of that cakey body underneath. Not a huge fried or crispy note to it, more of that sponge cake. Exhale has a clearer cake flavor up front.  A bit more of a fried note on the inhale, but It could easily pass as just some kind of crispier edge. No kind of waxy or playdough phenolic note. Tail end of the exhale is mostly cream for me. Not a ton of body, no real dairy to it, but fluffy lightly flavored vanilla filling. A bit of wax, but appropriate for the profile. No real harshness, and sweetness is on point. I do find myself wanting more body, especially on that cake note. It's there, but it needs just a bit fuller flavor.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Pretty spooky accurate, but I feel like it's all a bit light, especially the cake note.\n \n**Throat Hit:**Nah, not really. Maybe a bit dry.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  So, again this is pretty close to a solo flavor. I think the cake needs some help. If you're feeling dangerous some FW Cancer Cake may actually be the answer.  Alternatively, you could probably get by with some CAP Yellow Cake.  FLV Pound Cake may also be a good fit if you want more of that sponge cake flavor.  I wouldn't mess with the cream that much, but you could probably throw some CAP Vanilla Whipped Cream at it if you want to bump that cream note up.\n\nUsing this as a primary flavor, I think you could take this in some interesting trashy flavor directions.  Like coconut and raspberry for something approaching a zinger.  You might also be able to bring in some chocolate and FLV cream to try to emulsify the entire thing into more of a ding-dong or snowball. This does \"hostess\" style of bakery pretty well.\n\nI also think this may have some legs as a yellow cake replacement. Not so much for a heavier cake note, but a lighter take, heavy on the frosting.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, I'm having a problem finding the sweet spot with this. 1% is too light, for sure. 2% is starting to develop a bit, some cake texture, and a really light vanilla cream. 3% seems like it's mostly moving in the right direction, but it's picking up a dark savory flavor that's getting a bit distracting. 4% is getting really dark for me, not quite burnt but almost like a straight vanilla extract flavor. 5% is even worse on that dark flavor. So I'd probably be using this around 3%, but this is delicious and I just find myself wanting more than I can get out of this.  Switching setups to a MTL seems to help a bit, as does adding some sucralose, but I'm not sure you can flavor your way into this feeling like a full vape which is kind of a bummer for a flavor this fun.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Here's a post about the darker color.  FWIW, I've noticed no real coil gore with this. It's dark, but there doesn't seem to be any particulate matter or sugars that would burn in here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/6c8aiy/real_flavors_sponge_cake_is_blacker_than_my/)\n\n[Here's the ELR Page, just a couple of notes, one by \"Leilani\" that's pretty in depth, and pretty positive. No notes on the lightness I'm struggling with here.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/155230)\n\n[User \"SessionDrummer\" on the ELR Forums digs it. Spot on accurate.](http://forum.e-liquid-recipes.com/t/real-flavors-super-concentrates-tasting-notes-part-1/92474/1723)\n\n[Here's the product page from Real Flavors.  Their take: \"If you are not drooling already from the title, here is a more. Sweet spongy cake filled with a rich sweet cream and then deep fried to the perfect crisp. A huge hit in fairs across the global, this flavor is nothing but pure bliss. Can you guess why it sold out in beta testing?!\"](http://www.realflavors.com/shop/deep-fried-spongecake-super-concentrate/)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**\n\nH/T to /u/ID10-T for the suggestion.","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Deep Fried Spongecake SC","url":"https://redd.it/6ghbgu","vendor":{"name":"Real Flavors","code":"RF"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"RF","title":"Deep Fried Spongecake SC"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
