After a bit of a steep these elements actually come about a bit more, which surprised me. By the end of a two week steep the flavor had turned into a slightly tart and sweet, bright, and crisp apple. The flavor isn't spot on, it would need to be juicier at the very least to be more realistic - but its a good green apple flavor nonetheless.\n\n**Off-notes:** None that I noticed. Might get weird or floral at higher percentages.\n\n**Throat hit:** 6/10. The flavor is a kinda dry and harsh on the throat.\n\n**Uses:** Might work as a single flavor mix for some people, but adding just a few other flavors would make it so much better. /u/NotCharlesManson did this incredibly well in [Antoine](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/4282#antoine_by_notcharlesmanson), which is a bright green apple with tropical notes as described by the man himself. I use it mainly to brighten up fruit mixes or in a candy vape I want to add a bit of sweet/tart, both can be achieved using it at around or under 1%.\n\n**Pairings:** Fruits, candies, drinks/cocktails (appletini anyone?). I've tried it in creams and it is okay, I would NOT try it in bakeries or tobaccos. \n\n**Overall Impression:** While it isn't the most accurate representation of a green apple (it isn't tart or juicy enough) its still a good apple flavor. I have only had Fuji to compare it to, and both are good but have different apple profiles they aim to achieve (red vs. green), so aren't very interchangeable. If your looking for a slightly tart and sweet, kinda bright and crisp green apple INW Anton Apple might be what you're looking for.\n\nPlease put any other opinions on this flavor in the comments, and as usual let me know any way you all think the reviews could be improved.
