The picture is some kind of smoothie which makes more sense because I don't actually taste any yogurt here, but that strawberry/banana ratio is almost a perfect match for Yoplait. Very creamy and sweet by itself, great balance of the two fruits (not distinctly strawberry or banana, but instead the perfect blend). \n\n**Off-flavors:** none\n\n**Throat Hit:** none\n\n**Uses & Pairings:** Smoothies, milkshakes, yogurt, maybe some fruit mixes. 5% seems like a good starting place solo (and this is GOOD solo), but I think it might need more to stand up to creams.\n\n**Notes:** Pleasantly surprised at how good this is. The only gripe I have is that this is a bit too specific by which I mean it's probably not too versatile of a flavor. This would be great for a beginner as a standalone concentrate because it's not very concentrated (therefore quite forgiving in % of use) and delicious without any supporting flavors.\n\n**Second Opinions:** None yet; however, I did see that someone has linked my notes on e-liquid-recipes.\n\nEdit: forgot a word.","author":"PerennialPhilosopher","title":"Strawberry Banana","url":"https://redd.it/69roeq","vendor":{"name":"Liquid Nicotine Wholesale","code":"LNW"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"LNW","title":"Strawberry Banana"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
