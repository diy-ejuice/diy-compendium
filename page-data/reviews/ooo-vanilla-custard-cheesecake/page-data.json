It is very authentic. I don't know how else to describe it. It tastes like a slightly less sweet actual piece of cheesecake you would get at the cheesecake factory. Very thick mouth feel to help push the idea of cheesecake. \n\n**Off-flavors:**  Nothing\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Very minimal after a shake, completely gone after a steep.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This is going to be a great booster  for other cheesecake or custard mixes. I can see using this as a main note in cheesecakes as well as long as it is paired with a sweetener like meringue or super sweet. \n\n**Notes:**\nThis flavor definitely came out more after a steep. The main notes were all there, it was just a little thicker and creamier after the steep. \n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**\n\nIf you have different opinions on the flavor or any ideas on how to use it please post them in the comments.
