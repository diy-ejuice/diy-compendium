I read a lot of places that sour doesn't translate to vape. However a friend showed me a store bought juice they have and it was fairly sour, it tasted kinda like a sour mango. So I heard of the new cap sour and wanted to try it. \n\nIn the bottle it smells like fermented fruits which have been blended into a sour wine. \n\nTasting it on the back of my knuckles, it's definitely sour, and does taste like how it smells. It has a weird chemical taste on a final note. \n\nVaping it I tried it at various amounts to see just how 'powerful' it is. \n\n0.25% \nGetting slight notes of slightly old fruit. Not so much in the way of sour, just lots of VG sweetness. \n\n1%\nStill getting the fruit, less old fruit though, more like the 'sour' is balancing out the sweetness of the VG. It's almost like the stage of the warheads where you've gone through all of the sour and you're at the sweet stage and occasionally are reminded it once had sour on it. \n\n4%\nFeels like the old fermented fruits have come back. Has a tartness of white wine cross with a tart cider. Again sweeter than it is sour. It's just a fermented fruit flavour really. \n\nOverall it's more of a fermented fruit sour than it is powerful. As far as uses go, I'd recommend if you're wanting to make a sour beer or cider, it's going to give a fairly realistic sour fruits flavour, however it's definitely in no way a concentrate to make your flavours properly sour, as it is making a sour flavour or taste. \n\nIt's a confusing flavour to review and this is my first flavour test so hopefully it makes enough sense. Let me know if you've tried it higher or managed to somehow get a real sour effect from it. \n\n\n\nAfter thoughts, VG is very sweet, maybe doing this with more PG would have been more beneficial?","author":"Typical_Pakeha","title":"Powerful Sour","url":"https://redd.it/a1xt8y","vendor":{"name":"Capella","code":"CAP"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"CAP","title":"Powerful Sour"}},
