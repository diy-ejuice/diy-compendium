I think the percentage of use will be from 1% as a support for other berries (especially Blueberry or Blackberry) to 2% as a main flavor or lead note. i could see this used in candy mixes, bakeries, drinks, berry blends, etc.\n\n**Second Opinions:** i imagine other people got this during the sale so leave your opinions in the comments please! the Real Flavors site describes this as follows: [\"This seasonal fruit is an autumn/winter favorite. Mildly sweet and highly tart, pomegranates make a delicious snack and can be added to savory or dessert-style foods. Drinks like them too! Leave behind the chore of peeling those juicy red seeds out…that’s what we’re here for.\"](http://www.realflavors.com/shop/pomegranate-super-concentrate/) seems like a description of pomegranates themselves rather than the concentrate. couldn't find any other opinions on this one. \n\nEdit: changed bitter to tart for accuracy\n\nEdit2: I just wanted to clarify that this is really tasty and juicy. I would recommend trying this!
