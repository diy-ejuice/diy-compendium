We suggest using 2-4%\" http://flavourart.com/en/store/resellers/custom-mix/nonna-cake-en/\n\nI mixed it up at 3% as I figured that would be a good middle ground for an FA flavor. Most of us usually use FA anywhere from .5-4%. I mixed it at 70vg and 3mg nicotine just as I would any other mix. \n\n(3/23/16) Fresh - Lemon cake. Tastes very synthetic or plastic like, it immediately reminded me of those Hostess cupcakes, the yellow ones. Not sure if those are lemon flavored but I suppose the synthetic flavor reminded me of packaged cakes. \n\n24-48 hour age - Still a synthetic lemon cake. I suppose more bakery or cake notes come through. Fuck this lemon though. Pretty gross so far. \n\n7 days - Much more enjoyable, some of the lemon has faded and more cake comes through. Still very synthetic and not what I was hoping for. \n\nToday - I haven't had much desire to taste this further since it's been a let down. But today, after 12 days it's a much better vape. Most, but not all, of the lemon is all but gone. More bakery cake for sure. I think they were definitely going for a single flavor vape here. \n\nI can see this being used at very low percentages to add some cake notes, but the lemon is going to be there.  \n\nFinal thoughts. Why FA, why? Correct me if I'm wrong but this came out just as the bad news about FW Yellow Cake was announced. They had a perfect opportunity to release a white or yellow cake flavor. It would have been so popular, and it may still be. But, for me this sucks. I don't know what it is with Italians and their lemon deserts, but I feel as if they totally screwed this one up. FA, give us a plain yellow or white cake flavor to build off of. PLEASE. \n\n\n\n","author":"bigbruise","title":"Nonna's Cake","url":"https://redd.it/4dbkr0","vendor":{"name":"Flavour Art","code":"FA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FA","title":"Nonna's Cake"}},
