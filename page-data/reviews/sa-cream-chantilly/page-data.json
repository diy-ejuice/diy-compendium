    "result": {"data":{"reviewsJson":{"markdown":"**Setup:** Narda Clone, Single coil  26g Kanthal @.7 ohms.  25W Power, Half wicked with Native Wicks \n\n**Testing:** SA Cream Chantilly @ 3%. 70/30 VG/PG, steeped 7 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Smooth, rich cream. Nice and thick mouthfeel with a slight vanilla note. The inhale provides a smooth dark sweetness with a nice buttery exhale. This cream is a deeper, thicker cream, almost a hint of caramel or brown sugar.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Nothing off about this, even as a snv, it has a very nice flavor\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Minimal throat hit after a shake but nothing after it steeps.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I can see using this cream in a cream pie type recipe or with any fruits. I think it would be exceptionally tasty paired with peaches. I can also see this being used to accent cheesecakes and custards very well.\n\n**Notes:**\nThis is a great creamy flavor that is a bit darker. Almost reminds me of milk and honey although not quite as deep or sweet. It was good right after a shake but thickened up quite a bit after a steep. 3% seems to be right on the money for a solo mix. Would probably bump it down to 1.5% or 2% in mixes though.\n\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**\n\nIf you have different opinions on the flavor or any ideas on how to use it please post them in the comments.
