It translated to the actual flavor, unfortunately. I'm not even sure what I am tasting is even blueberry. I'm thinking \"blue\" but I'm not getting blueberry out of this. Its more like a \"blue\" cough syrup. It tastes almost mentholated, to be specific. Judging by how weak the actual \"blueberry\" flavor is from this, I don't believe it would improve by bringing the percentage down to something like 1.5. With Thai Pineapple being so good, I had high hopes for another fruit offering from SSA. This is a big let down, though. Its not necessarily a bad tasting flavor, but for it being a blueberry flavor, it doesn't quite work. It holds no spot in my arsenal. Sorry Sobucky, this one is a pass from me.\n\n**Off Flavors**: Menthol, cough medicine\n\n**Suggested Pairings**: WS-23, other fruits if you wanted to get down and weird with this.","author":"EdibleMalfunction","title":"Blueberry","url":"https://redd.it/jjnjd2","vendor":{"name":"Sobucky Super Aromas","code":"SSA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"SSA","title":"Blueberry"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
