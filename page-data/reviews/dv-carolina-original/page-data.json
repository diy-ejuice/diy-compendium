Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Decadent Vapours Carolina Original, 5% and 10%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 56 days.\n**Flavor Description:**  Mellow, straight forward tobacco.\n\nPretty staright-forward flavor here.  I’m pretty sure it’s just tobacco.  Moderately prominent dirty absolute base notes, along with a pretty mellow shag type lighter tobacco. Seems like some kind of permutation of a relatively neutral American tobacco.  Might lean more towards brightleaf or flue-cured with some light woody notes and a bit of tartness.  Non-aromatic and nothing too bold or spicy. More grassy than leafy, with a pretty strong hay note.  Seems sort of comparable to a slightly more robust version of something like HS Instrument.  Fairly easy-going, even with those dirtier, slightly ashy notes.\n\nMouthfeel is a bit thin.  No dessert or darker notes to really thicken this up.  Pretty neutral sweetness, but it doesn’t taste sickly or cloying to me.  A bit of astringency, but nothing really aggressive or bitter.  Feels a bit dry overall, but nothing too crazy.\n\n**Off-Flavors:**  Nah, not really.  Pretty straight forward and nothing weird.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light.  Gets a bit dry solo, but nothing major.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 5%,  lightly dirty and ashy and some dry hay notes.  Not particulary aggressive here but it does have at least a decent body to it.  Seems a bit unsatisfying here.\n\nAt 10%,  this is quite a bit dirtier, but those hay notes have more dimension to them and have started to come across more clearly as a tobacco leaf.  Very mild sweetness.\n\nDV usually uses a 20% suggestion.  Just based on these tests, I don’t really want this all that prominent in a mix.  I’d mostly be using this as an accent at around 7% behind more aggressive tobaccos.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I haven’t really had much luck working grassier tobaccos into much but pretty solidly tobacco vapes, but YMMV.\n\nThis is a bit green for any dessert tobacco uses.  The light tartness may go well with realistic fruits, but I’d worried about the mix tasting a bit too fresh with the grassy notes here.\n\nI’d mostly use this to bulk out or fluff up a heavier, darker tobacco.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  Pretty sure this one is a bulk or wholesale only flavor and I can’t find any real info on it.\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Carolina Original","url":"https://redd.it/8c6y7c","vendor":{"name":"Decadent Vapours","code":"DV"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"DV","title":"Carolina Original"}},
