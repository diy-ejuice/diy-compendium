Tested on B2K V3 stagger fused clapton .22 ohm 40 watts.\nSteeped for 3 weeks and test once a week.\n\n**Wonder Flavours Description:**\nFresh juicy and exotic strawberries merge to form a superior strawberry taste.\nWF suggests mixing solo 6-9%\n\n**Fresh:** (12-20-17)\nOn back of hand taste creamy and strawberry.\nVaped slightly harsh. Strawberry taste candied & has a medicinal off note.\n\n**Week 1:** (12-27-17)\nHarshness still present. Medicinal note seems to be getting stronger. Reminds me\nof a strawberry halls cough drop.\n\n**Week 2:** (1-2-18)\nHarshness is toned down a bit, but still very medicinal\n\n**Week 3:** 1-10-18)\nReally wasnâ€™t much change. Medicinal strawberry flavor & some harshness were still present.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nPLEASE KEEP IN MIND TASTE IS SUBJECTIVE, AND THESE ARE MY PRIVATE NOTES THAT I AM SHARING BECAUSE I SEEN NONE FOR THIS FLAVOR. \n\nWith all the other great strawberry options I would not recommend picking this one up, but if you do have it I recommend starting solo test at 5% or lower. Mixing I used this in an angel food cake recipe, and the harshness was pushed out by the creams & cake. The strawberry still had a little bit of the Halls cough drop flavor. Others have said this pairs well with CAP Sweet Strawberry, but i personally have not tested those two mixed together. \n\n**Recipe I Tested Flavor In:**\nELR Legend **FRESHEPIES**\n**Cracked Angels**\n<WF> Angel Cake (sc)         @3%\n<WF> Coconut Custard (sc) @2%\n<WF> Fresh Strawberries     @3%\n\n","author":"ebc88","title":"Fresh Strawberries","url":"https://redd.it/85eyn7","vendor":{"name":"Wonder Flavors","code":"WF"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"WF","title":"Fresh Strawberries"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
