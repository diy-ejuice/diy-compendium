Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FA Blenderize@ 2%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 6 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Juicy-fruit gum. Relatively soft, smooth and non-dairy creamy.  Wintergreen cooling in there with quite a bit of chalk. Pretty accurate to the profile.\n\nInhale is dense, chalky and soft. That juicy fruit flavor is present, but a tiny bit sour as it builds.  Beginning of the exhale has a stronger, but still relatively soft, juicy fruit flavor. Wintergreen cooling shows up on the back half of the exhale and becomes the primary note on the tail end as that juicy fruit gets really thin and a bit sour. Mouthfeel on the exhale is still fairly chalky and thick, with a muted candy-like sweetness. Sweetness overall is fairly restrained,\n\n**Off-flavors:** Noticeable wintergreen altoid / lifesaver kind of flavor. It's suprisingly accurate to the actual gum though.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light but inconsistent. I could swear this is completely smooth, and then I get a bit of a random harshness. Probably the cooling in here.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:** Strangely satisfying as a single flavor. Pretty well balanced and complicated enough that you're not getting bored right off the jump.  /u/SirSmokesALot suggests adding some TFA Dragonfruit, and yeah I can totally see that. Adding some Dragonfruit to my S&V test, and it definitely works to bump up the fruit flavor without destroying the mouthfeel.\n\nSort of going off that though, I had some of /u/ID10-T/ 's Mother of Dragon's Milk laying around and yeah, this stuff works pretty well there.  Probably heresy, but it's a fairly convincing juicy-fruit cream, if that's your thing for some reason.\n\nBeyond that, you're pretty much on your own. Most of the recipes I found play pretty close to that Juicy Fruit profile. I think there is some value in using this for the mouthfeel and texture.  You're going to have get past that vague generalized candy fruit note and the wintergreen, but at lower percentages this does have quite a bit of that texture without having either of those flavors be too distinctive.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nS&V Concentration testing, mostly just mouthfeel at 1%. Distinctly thick and chalky, with a kind of sour \"what the hell is that\" quality to the juicy fruit flavor. Clear juicy fruit at 2%, but still kind of mild overall. Texture is pretty substantial here and that wintergreen is pretty obvious.  At 3%, the juicy fruit flavor doesn't really get any sharper or more defined, but there is certainly more of it.  It's a fairly dense flavor, but not really all that fleshed out. Wintergreen gets pretty heavy here, and the chalk gets a little weird. I think, at 4% and above, you'd be able to say it's more of a wintergreen lifesaver flavor with an odd touch of juicy fruit.  I'd shamelessly steal the afforementioned tip from /u/SirSmokesALot and mix this as a juicy-fruit gum at 3% with .5% TFA Dragonfruit with a bit of a steep to let it homogenize and keep the dragonfruit in the mix and not on top of it. If you're mixing and just after the texture I'd go for 1.5%.\n\nI picked this up for an earlier version of THE shurb clone. It's a damn accurate juicy fruit flavor, for better or worse.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Good overall discussion of your \"Juicy Fruits.\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/33c6ym/tutti_frutti_juicy_fruit_flavor/) FW Juicy Fruit is now apparently named Beetle Juice and was apparently the keystone of /u/captaincannibal/ 's epic [Shurb clone.](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/22318#shurb_by_captaincannibal)\n\n[ELR notes are mostly copies of HIC's notes.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/18351)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Blenderize (Tutti Frutti)","url":"https://redd.it/5mht2l","vendor":{"name":"Flavour Art","code":"FA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FA","title":"Blenderize (Tutti Frutti)"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
