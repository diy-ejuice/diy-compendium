Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Vape Train Brandy, 1%, 4% and 8%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 26 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Fruity and boozy brandy.\n\nSuprisingly accurate boozy note here.  Actually has a medium brandy type heat, and tastes pretty well fermented and distilled. Sweeter brandy, tastes a bit cheap and funky overall, but hey it actually tastes like brandy. Some light oak barrel-ish astringency and just slightly tannic.  Nothing that feels like a char though.\n\nThis is fairly fruity.  I get a dark fermented grape note sticking out here.  The sweetness makes it seem just a bit raisiny.  Seems fairly appropriate for a brandy.  I maybe pick up an errant hint of vanilla here or there, but it's not overwhelming or distinct enough to be really distracting.  Seems to have just a bit of an orange zest at the end of the vape as well.\n\nUnlike some of the other vape train boozes, this seems to be more than just a boozy top.  There is some actual body in here.  It's not anywhere near thick or dense, but it does a serviceable job of conveying a fuller brandy flavor solo.  Again, a bit on the sweet side, but not out of bounds for a brandy flavor.\n\n**Off-Flavors:**  Tastes like a pretty cheap brandy, but nothing outside of the profile.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Moderate, but it's pretty realistically boozy.  Nothing unexpected.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 1%, this is a bit odd.  Still kind of fermented tasting, but not really boozy.  Kind of a sour, fruity bubblegum kind of vibe.  That grape is coming through pretty clear here.  Lighter flavor overall.\n\nAt 4%, definitely tastes more like a brandy and those boozy notes have filled in quite a bit. Still a bit fruity and sweet on balance, but that boozy top end sells the brandy thing fairly well.  Seems a bit thin overall.\n\nAt 8%, this is a stronger, boozier brandy.  That fruit seems more integrated with the liquor base and it's picking up a kind of sugary, raisiny sweetness.  Medium body and a boozy punch.\n\nVape Train suggests mixing with this at 2-5% or standalone at 5-8%.  I actually like it quite a bit more on the high side, but it's pretty aggressive and boozy.  Just based on these tests, I'd be mixing with this around 3-4% as an accent, or 6% as a primary flavor.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  The heavy booziness here kind of limits the applications of this to cocktails.  In general, should pair pretty well with citrus, apples, pears, and stone fruit like plums and cherries.  Could be interesting paired with FW Pink Champagne to pick up those grape fruity notes.  Maybe a bit fruity for any real classic brandy cocktails, but I'd wager this wouldn't make a bad sidecar.\n\nThis is boozy and funky enough I'm not coming up with any real applications outside of cocktails.  If you wanted more of a cooked brandy note for bakeries or creams, I'd probably just go with FA Brandy.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Hey, there's actually a note up on ELR about this.  User \"Kotsos\" writes: \"This is closer to INW Brandy than FA Brandy, quite boozy but way more balanced than the INW one (which has bitter off notes and needs extra caution in mixes), it's got warmth and depth, and a very nice brandy/whiskey aftertaste. I can imagine it taking Bourbon flavors up a notch and giving a twist to heavy tobaccos and custards/caramels, I wouldn't pair it with fruit like FA. More notes after I test it in mixes.\"](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/229485)\n\n[Here's the product page from Vape Train.  Their description: \"This flavour works well in many bakery, dessert, creamy, and candy e-liquid recipes.\"  Maybe less than helpful there.](https://www.vapetrain.com.au/shop/vt-concentrates/brandy-concentrate-diy-for-e-liquid-recipe/)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Brandy","url":"https://redd.it/84l3y5","vendor":{"name":"Vape Train Australia","code":"VTA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"VTA","title":"Brandy"}},
