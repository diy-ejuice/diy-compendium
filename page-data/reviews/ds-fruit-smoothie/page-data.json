Flavor @ 3% and 5%.\n\n**Notes:** This flavor is a definitely a tropical fruit blend. Just smelling the bottle, I feel like I can pick out melon, peach/apricot, and possibly papaya. Vaping it, I really feel like there's a creamy melon base and a peach/apricot top note. The peach is more of a sweet peach juice than a peach fruit, and it's most apparent at the end of the exhale. The melon has a generic melon taste but feels very thick and heavy. It's not watermelon, and I feel like its creamy taste pushes it in a honeydew or cantaloupe direction. The papaya sits in the middle of the mix, and it reminds me a lot of FLV's Papaya Punch flavor. It works well with the melon- it doesn't weigh it down too much, and it doesn't overpower the peachy top note. I occasionally pick up on a pineapple juice taste, but it's not prominent or dominant. When I first noticed the pineapple note, it made the entire flavor suddenly seem like a white gummy bear profile.\n\nThe flavor is supposed to be a smoothie, but it's a fruit-only smoothie. There's creaminess in the melon/papaya note, but that's it, and it's more of a quality of the melon than an actual added cream. I can't pick out any singular cream or yogurt flavor. I don't find this to be a bad thing, though. In fact, I think it works better this way. Everything feels evenly balanced, and I think the presence of a strong cream note would mute the intricacies way too much and throw things out of balance.\n\n**Mouthfeel:** This is really dense, especially for a fruit mix. It's smooth and thick without much throat hit. The thickness has a strong gummy/jelly candy quality. To me, this is more of a fruit snacks flavor than a fruit smoothie.\n\n**Off-Notes:** I don't find anything about the flavor to be off-putting, but if you're sensitive to the musty, funky taste that sometimes accompanies tropical fruits, you may not love this flavor. I can only really pick up on it at the very end, but it does hang around in the mouth for a bit. \n\n**Suggested percentages and pairings:** I was told by DuraSmoke to test their flavors around the 10% range, but after receiving the flavors, that seemed way too high. For RDA/RTA use, I'd shoot for 2-4% in a mix or 4-5% solo. 8-10% would be most suitable in a pod system or lower wattage MTL setup.  \n\nThis would pair well with other fruits, particularly orange, strawberry, mango, banana, pineapple, and guava. It'd work well in beverage and candy profiles. It isn't going to mesh well with dairy or bakery flavors.","author":"PepperMyJabrill","title":"Fruit Smoothie","url":"https://redd.it/e90jbg","vendor":{"name":"DuraSmoke","code":"DS"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"DS","title":"Fruit Smoothie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
