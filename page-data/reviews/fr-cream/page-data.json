Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Flavor Revolution Cream, 1% and 3%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 31 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Dry, fluffy vanilla cream.\n\nI get more vanilla than dairy out of this.  Not full-on frosting, but that same kind of bright vanilla note.  Moderate vanilla overall, but sticks out quite against a more mellow cream.  Vanilla gets slightly chemical and bitter with extended vaping.\n\nLight and nondescript richness here.  Somewhere between buttery and waxy. Nothing butryic or too aggressive, but very little identifiable dairy taste.  Vanilla dominates most of the vape, but some dairy sneaks in on the back end.  I get more dairy on the breath after vaping this, then during the actual vape.\n\nThe mouthfeel on this is interesting.  Its moderately full but fairly dry.  Vanilla makes it seem a bit more lively in the top notes than something like FA Fresh Cream, but lacking some of the richer base and mouthfeel.  Almost seems a bit fluffy compared to a flatter cream flavor.  The vanilla, lack of dairy notes, and the fluffiness definitely leans towards a whipped cream bordering on a drier marshmallow or meringue flavor.\n\n**Off-Flavors:**  Pretty solid vanilla hit for a straight cream flavor. Gets a bit bitter solo.  Dry, fluffy texture.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light, mostly from the dryness.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 1%,  this is pretty dry and light on flavor.  Soft vanilla, not much actual cream.\n\nAt 3%,  this feels a bit fuller.  I'm still getting some dryness in the middle of the flavor but the base is a bit richer.  Vanilla is getting pretty aggressive, and doesn't really mesh with the lighter dairy notes all that well.\n\nJust based on these tests, I'd probably start out around their suggested 2% with this one.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:** I'd probably use more like a whipped cream for layering.  Probably a better fit for bakeries than trying to use in a milkier profile.  The vanilla could kind of stand in for a cereal malt in a cereal milk, but the dryer texture is going to sit on top of bakery bases rather than really fill in the gaps.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  I can't really find anything out there on this one.\n\n[I've only seen these at Nicotine River.  Here's the product page.  Their description: \"A sweet and delicious Cream! Smooth notes make this flavor the perfect background flavor for desserts and fruits! Best part of all? It's diketone free!\"  They seem really excited about this one.  There is a one star review on there, but it literally nothing to do this flavor.](https://www.nicotineriver.com/products/flavor-revolution-cream)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Cream","url":"https://redd.it/7wkal0","vendor":{"name":"Flavor Revolution","code":"FR"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FR","title":"Cream"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
