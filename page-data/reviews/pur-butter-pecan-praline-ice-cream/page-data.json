I'm not getting ice cream or a specific type of nut. At 4 weeks this has really turned around. It has developed a rich and creamy butter pecan flavor, not anywhere near generic anymore. The pecan flavor has become more prominent, and I'm getting noticeable amounts of the buttery brown sugary pralines that somehow stands out from the butter pecan base. I don't get the actual crunch of the pralines, but the crystallized butter and brown sugar candied pecans is so authentic I can almost imagine it when I close my eyes. The density and body has shown a huge improvement as well, moving it from a cream to more of an ice cream. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:** None\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit:** 1/10\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Pairings:**  Cookies, cakes, custards, pies, bakeries, nuts, tobaccos, coffees, Koolada. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Notes:** I am really liking this one a lot, but it is slightly weak at this percentage. I'm thinking more like 8-12% for a single flavor. Maybe 1.5-4% for an accent flavor. I see this adding a huge boost to the body, richness and flavor of almost all bakeries, especially danishes or nut desserts.","author":"mysticrosell","title":"Butter Pecan Praline Ice Cream","url":"https://redd.it/6dkr7u","vendor":{"name":"Purilum","code":"PUR"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"PUR","title":"Butter Pecan Praline Ice Cream"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
