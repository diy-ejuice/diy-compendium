Chocolate is the dominant ice cream of this flavor and if any dry notes do occur, a simple cream addition can do the trick!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Manufacturer Suggested Usage:** 5-10%\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Aroma:** Banana, chocolate, strawberry, cream.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Flavor Description:** Chocolate and banana are pretty dominant here, I'm not getting much else. The banana is a pretty authentic fresh banana. The chocolate tastes like it has a cocoa powder base, it's not syrupy or rich. There is just a faint hint of strawberry that you have to search for in the very back. Mouth feel/body is not creamy and actually dry. It's lacking the strawberries, ice cream, and whipped cream.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:** Dryness, lack of strawberry, ice cream, and chocolate.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit:** 1/10\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Uses:** A base for developing a banana split. I've kind of hit a wall on this one. I've got nothing.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Notes:** Flavor strength was moderate at this strength. I don't recommend a single flavor percentage on this one. Maybe 4-6% if attempting to build a banana split? This does need moisture for any application in my opinion.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Other Opinions:** From louiesquared on ELR: Not getting much banana from this. Heavy on the chocolate. Thereâ€™s a hint of creams but not really ice cream. The chocolate is pretty good. Similar to Hershey syrup. Would be a good addition to an ice cream or milkshake.","author":"mysticrosell","title":"Banana Split","url":"https://redd.it/75mo7e","vendor":{"name":"Purilum","code":"PUR"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"PUR","title":"Banana Split"}},
