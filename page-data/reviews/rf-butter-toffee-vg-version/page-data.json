I'm actually very disappointed with this one, I was expecting more. I'm not even getting a toffee flavor really, just weak butter richness with maybe a slightly caramel sweetness. At this point I'm not sure what if anything it will be good with. I would say to add some butter flavor maybe, but I think it would take a higher percentage than reasonable to achieve a buttery effect. Will see if it strengthens with a longer steep.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Steep Time:** 6 Weeks\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis hasn't changed much since the last test. I am going to mix this at 20% and see if the flavor gets stronger. If not, I don't really see much of a use for this really. The percentage would have to be too high to use as an accent, or even to really get flavor from this one beyond a generic weak creaminess sweetened with a bit of rich caramel.\n&nbsp;","author":"mysticrosell","title":"Butter Toffee VG Version","url":"https://redd.it/55sjwp","vendor":{"name":"Real Flavors","code":"RF"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"RF","title":"Butter Toffee VG Version"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
