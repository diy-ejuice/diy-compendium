Running Dual framed staples @0.08ohm. 6x.5 Ribbon,26GSS Frames,40G N80 Wrap*\n\n**Tested Percentage**\n\n*10% as recommended on the bottle*\n\n**Off Flavors**\n\n*Absolutely None, authenticity is off the charts with this one*\n\n**Main Flavor Notes**\n\nIf it counts for anything, Orange is one flavor that I have generally not agreed with. In commercial juice or DIY. It always comes out harsh or candy like and I can't usually tolerate much of it. I've tried several variations of orange concentrates and some are definitely considerably better than others. I think the best I've had previous to this was Blood Orange from FA and I did enjoy that one.\n\nFlavor Monks orange is straight up orange. No off tastes or candy tones. The authenticity is off the charts. The orange citrus is real strong and it tastes exactly like an orange, I mean it, exactly like an orange! I could vape this solo with a touch of sweetner and be happy. I did find that the overall tone of the orange changes slightly from the inhale to the exhale. Inhaling I find it's more of a natural pure tasting orange zest where as the exhale is tasting just like the fruit. I would relate this to something of a mix between a navel orange and a clementine. I say clementine because of that sour but sweet and tangy taste they have and I do catch some of that over top the orange taste. Overall, this is the best orange I have had and will cherish what I have of it.  \n\nThis orange is one of their 100% naturally produced flavors. Others include lemon,lime and gin flavors. \n\n**Possible Pairings**\n\nThis is going to go well in about any fruit mix. As with the other flavor monks flavors I've tested, while the solo is high at 10%, in a mix these seem to be a while different beast. I'd tame this at around 1.5-2% for a full frontal orange note or 0.5-1% for a mild citrus back note. Either way you use it, this is something you'll want to keep in your arsenal at all times.","author":"Lampburglar","title":"Orange","url":"https://redd.it/7fa1ac","vendor":{"name":"Flavour Monks","code":"FM"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FM","title":"Orange"}},
