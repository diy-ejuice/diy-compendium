Sobucky describes this as \"Amazing thai version with the exotic twist.\" I'm not really getting anything exotic here. Google doesn't return anything particular for a \"Thai pineapple\" so I dont know if that is an actual kind of pineapple. There's definitely no lack of flavor here. I can see this being used as a main pineapple flavor in a mix with no help needed. Its got the same kind of syrupy goodness that VT Sugarloaf Pineapple has but lacking that tiny bit of acidity and candiness.  So if you really wanted, you could use a tiny, tiny bit of TFA ~~Battery Acid~~ Pineapple to bring in some of that acidity. \n\n**Off Flavors**: None\n\n**Suggested Percentages**: 3-4%\n\n**Suggested Pairings**: Its pineapple. Use as you would in pretty much anything that pairs with pineapple. Fruits, creams, bakeries, all fair game here.","author":"EdibleMalfunction","title":"Thai Pineapple","url":"https://redd.it/jjgdfi","vendor":{"name":"Sobucky Super Aromas","code":"SSA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"SSA","title":"Thai Pineapple"}},
