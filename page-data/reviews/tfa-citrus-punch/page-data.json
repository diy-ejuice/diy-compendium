Not dense, but heavy on the throat (7/10)\n\n**Flavor Properties**: - Refreshing lemon-lime, tastes like a carbonated beverage. Heavy on the lime, light on the lemon.\n\n**Relatable Flavors**: - I purchased this flavor because it's been said to be a standalone Mountain Dew clone but I disagree. It's more of a mix between Mountain Dew and Sprite, but too acidic to be considered one or the other.\n\n**Off Flavors**: Slight cough syrup aftertaste at 10%, I expect this to decline at lower percentages.\n\n**Position in the recipe**: - Works as a base in fruit mixtures, or a top note in a custard/pie recipe. Will accent other fruits well at 3-5%, and I imagine it would taste great with a custard base.\n\n**Pairings:** - Other fruits, custards/pies/creams, soda mixes, lemon meringue\n\nNotes: As a standalone, this is 85% Mountain Dew. I'm sure there's something out there to cut the acidity and give the extra sweet flavor that this soda clone is missing. I will be trying champagne, cream, and sweetener and will edit this post when I find something that clicks.\n","author":"LiquidIce25","title":"Citrus Punch","url":"https://redd.it/4pkhku","vendor":{"name":"The Flavor Apprentice","code":"TFA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"TFA","title":"Citrus Punch"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
