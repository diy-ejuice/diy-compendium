    "result": {"data":{"reviewsJson":{"markdown":"**Setup:** Narda Clone, Single coil  26g Kanthal @.7 ohms.  25W Power, Half wicked with Native Wicks Platinum Blend\n\n**Testing:** FW Maple Pecan @ 4%. 70/30 VG/PG, steeped 14 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Dry, sweet and nutty. It is more like dry roasted pecans drizzled in maple syrup. The maple is prevalent but not overbearing. It is a nice rich heavy yet thin flavor. \n\n**Off-flavors:**  Not a one\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Very smooth, although it has been steeping for a couple of weeks. The dryness adds a little tinge of throatiness which comes off as a little harsh when it is fresh\n\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This would be good paired with cookies, custards, ice creams, certain fruits like peaches would be really good with this. I can see this being made with a waffle flavor as well. Kind of like butter pecan syrup you get at ihop mixed with a little maple syrup. \n\n\n**Notes:**\nI really like this flavor, it is very tasty and I can see it being used with butter pecan or maybe wf butter pecan pie to bring in some additional sweetness. It is dark and heavy but if used lightly could be a great accent. \n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nThere are no notes on atf about this flavor and very few on elr\n\n[/u/R08U57 used this flavor in a maple bar recipe](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/4i63mk/tips_for_maple_glaze_taste/)\n\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**\n\nIf you have different opinions on the flavor or any ideas on how to use it please post them in the comments.
