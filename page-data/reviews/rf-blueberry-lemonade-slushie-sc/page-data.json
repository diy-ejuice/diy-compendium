The blueberry tastes like a mix of fresh and artificial, but closer to the fresh side, and juicy. The lemonade has that artificial overly sweetened slurpee taste. Very authentic to a slurpee, it is overall a sweet flavor, with only a tiny hint of tart. It doesn't taste like a glass of lemonade with blueberry in it, it truly has a slushie flavor. It says in the description it has cooling affect, but I can't find it. Great summer beverage, it would be better with additional cooling/Koolada to really take it all the way. This is a pretty complex and complete flavor, easily a single flavor.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:** Lack of cooling/Koolada\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit:** 3/10\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Pairings:** Additional berries, strawberry, raspberry, mixed, boysenberry, blackberry. Koolada or Polar Blast. Tart and sour.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Notes:** The flavor is a good strength at 3%. It will be interesting to see if this fades with a longer steep as lemons as notorious for doing. I will be trying a bit of tart and sour for my taste preferences. I like a super tart bite to my lemonade. Along with Koolada. I see this being a very popular flavor this summer.\n","author":"mysticrosell","title":"Blueberry Lemonade Slushie SC","url":"https://redd.it/6dyqbv","vendor":{"name":"Real Flavors","code":"RF"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"RF","title":"Blueberry Lemonade Slushie SC"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
