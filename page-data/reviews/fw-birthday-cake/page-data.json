Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FW Birthday Cake, 2 and 4%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 6 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** White cake with vanilla frosting and a pretty aggressive artificial note.  White cake note is fairly mellow. Decent texture but the cake taste seems a bit light. No real rich or eggy notes to it. Frosting has a little wax to it, but seems a bit underdone for a birthday cake, not quite that obnoxious sweetness I want. Pretty heavy artificial taste to it.  Just a theory, but I think they are trying to emulate that weird bitter note from using way too much food coloring or sprinkles... but my palate could just be broken. I'm not 100% sure what constitutes \"a birthday cake\" specifically, but I associate the flavor with FW Cake Batter Dip and this doesn't really have that obnoxious frosting note. I'm not 100% sure on usage for this, it doesn't really scratch my itch for obnoxious birthday cake flavor and I think you could get there using other concentrates. If you are going to use this, about 6% seems to be the sweet spot.\n\nInhale is sweet.  Some frosting here with a lighter vanilla and a pretty artificial edge. Some waxiness to the frosting note. A little light for a cake flavor but not too airy.  Exhale has dry white cake up front. Decent amount of texture without a whole lot of richness. Good separation between frosting and cake notes. That same aggressive artificial top note, getting a little bitter and chemical tasting.  Fairly dry mouthfeel from the cake with and a bit of bitterness from the frosting.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  The \"birthday\" part of this tastes artificial and slightly bitter.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light. Fairly smooth except for that artificial edge.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I'm not sure that I'll be using this.  FW White Cake seems like a better white cake flavor, and the frosting note is pretty weird and doesn't really scratch the birthday cake kind of itch.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, 2% seems too light. Kind of bitter and chemical without much body. 4% is a bit more full, but still doesn't really have a full sweet frosting note. Cake is present and textured without being dry. 6% is fairly dry overall. Frosting note is sweet but that artificial edge is kind of killing it for me. 8% is maybe a bit too dry and it's getting a bit bitter. 10% is too dry overall.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nIt's a new flavor, so not really.\n\n[Here's the product page from Flavorwest. No SDS up yet, so no clue as to whatever weirdness this may contain.  But hey... \"Independently laboratory tested Diacetyl free.\"  This definitely needs some Diacetyl.](http://flavorwest.com/index.php/water-soluble-flavoring/birthday-cake.html)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**\n\n[Bonus video first test of the new Flavorwest cakes.](https://youtu.be/bZ8O10b0Ymw)","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Birthday Cake","url":"https://redd.it/6pe9xu","vendor":{"name":"Flavor West","code":"FW"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FW","title":"Birthday Cake"}},
