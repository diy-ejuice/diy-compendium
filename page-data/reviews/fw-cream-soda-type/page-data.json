I tried at 5% and am thinking maybe that's too low for it (based on ELR values), but it does seem to darken my wick and gunk my coils, so I'm not particularly inclined to use it any higher or at all. Zero effervesence (which I was really hoping for), very slight vanilla maybe, a mild sweet-creaminess. I don't see this flavoring offering anything that other flavors don't already do better. Bummer.  \n\nI thought maybe it was my flavoring since I picked it up at my local B&M on a whim, but it appears -- based on the batch number -- that it may have been bottled 12/4/15\n\n**On the Nose**  \nEthyl Alcohol. Very dark in color.\n\n**Usage**  \n*Stand alone*: 5-10%. \n\n*In a mix*: Don't... ok 3-5%?\n\n**Throat**  \nNone.\n\n**Pairings**  \nPerhaps Creams, Vanillas, Fruits. \n\n**Avoid**  \nThis Flavoring\n\n**Steep**  \nDidn't notice any difference at shake-n-vape, 3 days, 1 week.\n\n**Recipe Ideas**  \nOnly thing I can think of is maybe an italian soda, but there are better options out there.  \n\n*Please if your opinion differs, or you have another review for this post it in the comments. Will help the master list with multiple reviews in one spot.*","author":"CheebaSteeba","title":"Cream Soda Type","url":"https://redd.it/4p8yqe","vendor":{"name":"Flavor West","code":"FW"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FW","title":"Cream Soda Type"}},
