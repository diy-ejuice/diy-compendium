It actually tastes like a true FV Custard, rich with the egg yolk but no eggy taste, and the creamy mouth feel rivals CAP V1 for me. I am a huge custard person and CAP V1 has always been my favorite. This has overtaken it and is now number 1 for me. It has that caramelized vanilla flavor, so it won't be a sub in recipes that just need that plain vanilla creaminess. I would compare it to a super creamy, thick rich home churned FV ice cream.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIt's not that true classic \"custard\" taste. Most custards are known for that rich egg based and flavored thick vanilla cream. This is more of a an ice cream base french vanilla. I compare it to CAP to compare that creamy mouth feel. Almost like when you eat a bite of pudding or drink buttermilk. You can almost feel that cream type film on your tongue. If I tasted this blind without knowing the name Premium French Vanilla, I would say it is a french vanilla ice cream with the creamy mouth feel and density of a Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream. Or a french vanilla custard. It could be very versatile. I believe this is an excellent SF, and will make an excellent accent as well. I will update at 4 weeks to see how this strengthens/changes with a steep.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Steep Time:** 4 Weeks\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAt a 4 week steep this is still blowing my socks off. This has mellowed slightly with a steep. Until I tried it at 4 weeks, I didn't realize it had a very slight sharpness/harshness to it at the 3 day test. I thought it was part of the caramelization in the flavoring. Now it has smoothed out noticeably. I loved it at the 3 day mark as well though, it's so slight I didn't notice until I had a longer steep to compare (maybe a bit of alcohol in the flavoring?) I will go on record as saying this has moved into the number 1 slot for custards for me. I still love CAP V1 for a classic vanilla custard. But if you are looking for a rich french custard or ice cream this is the \"one\".\n\n&nbsp;\n\nEDIT: Real Flavors has announced they will be changing the names of their Raw Extracts to Super Concentrates.","author":"mysticrosell","title":"French Vanilla SC","url":"https://redd.it/55sbvb","vendor":{"name":"Real Flavors","code":"RF"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"RF","title":"French Vanilla SC"}},
