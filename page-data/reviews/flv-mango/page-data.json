The tropical fruit flavor is there, but at 3%, it lacks the bit of bright wetness an actual mango would have.  I also get a bit of a pineapple/orange flavor combo at higher temps.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Nothing really off here.\n\n**Throat hit:** 2/10 pretty light\n\n**Uses:** 1-2% as an accent in a tropical mix or even a contrast fruit in a darker mix.   3-5% as a front note.  If you're after a plain Mango ADV, try it at 5-6%.  Flavor uses and recipes discussed much more in-depth in FOTW posts [here](https://redd.it/54q29w) and [here](https://redd.it/37xd26).\n\n**Pairings:**  Most any fruits, lighter creams, a dash of sweetener might even be preferred to help round out the flavor better.  \n\n**Notes:** This is a decently solid mango flavor though I feel Flavorah could bump up the potency a bit or just drop the prices already.\n\n[Link to a past review of FLV Mango by /u/kirkt](https://redd.it/4mj06v)\n\nFlavor available at BCF [here](http://www.bullcityflavors.com/mango-flv/) \n\n[Link to e-liquid-recipes notes on this flavor](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/94331)\n\n[Link to all of our flavor reviews in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)","author":"wh1skeyk1ng","title":"Mango","url":"https://redd.it/5rbzn1","vendor":{"name":"Flavorah","code":"FLV"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FLV","title":"Mango"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
