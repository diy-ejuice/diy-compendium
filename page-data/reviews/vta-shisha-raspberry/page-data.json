Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Vape Train Shisha Raspberry, 1%, 4% and 8%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 12 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Vape Train says this: \"is on the slightly on the sweeter spectrum of raspberry flavours without the tartness of actual real raspberries.\"  I'm not sure I agree.\n\nThe top end of the flavor is actually fairly tart.  Feels like a pretty realistic kind of raspberry tartness, stopping short of an over-aggressive citrusy or sour candy type of tartness. Softer flavor, without much in the way of bite or punch. Base is a bit heavier, but still not overwhelmingly sticky or cloying.  I think the base is where the candy is coming in, with a warm, flat kind of sweetness.  Pretty straight-forward raspberry candy flavor, but not really intense.  Overall effect with the tartness is still sort of candied, but not a full on candy raspberry.\n\nI will say, I think this flavor lacks some vibrancy and depth.  That tarter top end is relatively thin and soft, and the body doesn't hit a syrupy, bold kind of richness you get from the more aggressive raspberry flavors.  The actual structure of the flavor kind of reminds me of a Medicine Flower flavor.  What's here is fairly evocative of a raspberry, it just doesn't cohere into something that feels bold, at least at the tested percentages.\n\nOff-flavors feel pretty mellow for a raspberry flavor.  At 8% I'm picking up something a maybe a bit floral, but it's not nearly as floral as berry flavors can get.  I'm not picking up anything green or vegetal.  It also doesn't seem to have the dreaded ketchup vibe of TPA Sweet Raspberry.\n\nI think the closest analogue for this I've tested is probably FLV Red Raspberry.  I think the FLV Red Raspberry tastes a bit more realistic and almost seedy, but this is quite a bit more easygoing and imparts some of that tartness without having to really fine-tune your percentages to avoid blowing the recipe out with aggressive florals and sticky sweetness.\n\n**Off-Flavors:**  Lightly floral at higher percentages.  Feels a bit soft.\n\n**Throat Hit:**Light, I get a tiny bit of bite but not out of line for a fruit flavor. \n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 1%,  I'm getting some light, fairly realistic raspberry tartness in the top notes.  Sweeter base hasn't really come through, and I'm still tasting quite a bit of my testing base.\n\nAt 4%,  tartness is a bit more pronounced. Still feels fairly realistic.  Lightly candied raspberry base, stil feels a bit soft and not really heavy or syrupy.\n\nAt 8%, doesn't feel much more tart or busy on the top end.  Picking up a light floral note. Base is maybe just a bit heavier but still doesn't feel all that full. \n\nVape Train suggests mixing this from 2-5%, and that seems like a good enough recommendation.  Just based on these tests, I'd say this is vapable higher, but doesn't really bring anything to the table at higher concentrations. I'd go around 2-3% as a raspberry accent.  Doesn't really seem to have enough presence for a solo or primary flavor.  As soft as the top end of this flavor feels, it does show up pretty well in mixes from some limited mixing experience with it.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I'd use this as a tarter raspberry accent in heavier profiles. Seems like a really good fit for tobaccos, or as raspberries (instead of a raspberry frosting or jam) on top of a bakery profile.  Really good fit for cocktail or beverage profiles.  Kind of reminds me of the raspberry note from raspberry zinger tea.\n\nDecent raspberry choice for creams to keep them from going too floral or turning them into something that feels like a raspberry syrup.\n\nYou could probably throw enough at this to make it sort of work as a candy raspberry, but there are better options for that.\n\nWould work okay as a raspberry accent in busier fruit profiles, assuming you've got most of your body from something else.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  I can't find anything solid out there.\n\n[Here's the product page from Vape Train Australia.
