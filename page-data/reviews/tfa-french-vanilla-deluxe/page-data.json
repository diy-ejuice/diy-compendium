    "result": {"data":{"reviewsJson":{"markdown":"**Percentage Used:** 10%\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Equipment Used:**  Troll RDA with a wickless single SS .8 ohm Clapton coil at 20W.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**PG/VG:** 30/70\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Steep Time:** 2 Weeks\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Aroma:** Deep vanilla, caramel, cream, sweetness.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Flavor Description:** Buttery, rich caramelized french style custard. Super smooth custard created with the richness of egg yolks and cream, which provides that unique buttery silky custard. Even with that, I don't taste any egg here. Heavy warm vanilla notes with caramelized sugar. Balanced just on the edge of caramel with a slight nutty note. This is a very complex and dense custard, and makes an excellent single flavor with a pleasing and tempting characteristic aroma.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:** None\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit:** 3/10\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Pairings:** Cake, coffee, cookies, other creams, nuts, tobaccos, ice cream, shakes, cupcakes, pies, cheesecake, white chocolate, frostings, whipped cream. Fruits that pair well with cream.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Notes:** This has a lovely mouth feel, not as thick on the tongue as CAP V1, but more buttery and silky. Good single flavor strength for me at 10%, but I could see pushing it to 12-14% for an in your face flavor. In blends this would be good from .5-4% depending on the application.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Comparison:** While I like TFA French Vanilla Creme, this is the real thing while the creme is the fat free diet version. This is more rich and complex, and has the body that is missing with the creme. The creme is more milky than creamy.","author":"mysticrosell","title":"French Vanilla Deluxe","url":"https://redd.it/5rm8r9","vendor":{"name":"The Flavor Apprentice","code":"TFA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"TFA","title":"French Vanilla Deluxe"}},
