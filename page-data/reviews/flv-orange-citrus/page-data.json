Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Orange Citrus @ 3%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 12 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Cooked navel oranges almost pushing into cooked meyer lemons.  Pulls off the impression of oranges without getting too far into bright, harsh acidity, and zest notes.  Surprisingly warm and thick for a citrus.\n\nInhale has a just of bit of that normal building zest flavor you get with citrus. Light, pretty organic tasting sweetness. Exhale is a mellow, warm, and moderately thick. Soft, kind of stewed orange. Sweetness is again, fairly natural tasting.  Not dry or juicy, more just thick and soft.  Exhale has some lingering zest notes, left over from that slightly sharp inhale.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Bit of a waxy mouthfeel, especially at high percentages.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light, especially compared to other citrus.\n\n**Uses:** Rounding out harsher citruses.  EM will sort of saw off a lot of your top notes, while this should give the entire orange a fleshier aspect while leaving those top notes in there.  Flatter citrus will blend well in heavier recipes.  Pretty good base for an orange candy with that fuller, duller flavor.  Tropical fruit juices or smoothies would be great, as this is mellow enough to let some other flavors shine though.\n\n**Pairings:**  Low percentages of bright citrus to give you some top notes back.  Good excuse to use harsh citrus as an accent.  Should pair well with creams and bakeries. Cactus for some juiciness. Bright fruits, especially strawberry.  Natural fit for spice or tea flavors. The lack of harsh top notes will let those kind of floral or more aggressive spice notes shine.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nWith regards to percentage use, this seems to be really linear up to 6%, with that 6% giving you a pretty unmistakeable citrus feeling.  If you chase a straight orange flavor, the wax and weird structure of the flavor are going to catch up with you before get anything like a full orange.  I'd mix 4-5% for a citrus mix, and I'd stay at around 2-3% for a supporting flavor in a non-citrus dominant mix.\n\nOverall, the cost here is the biggest issue. With that said, this has a place if you are looking for an interesting citrus component well suited for flavor blends.\n\nShoutout to /u/apexified for sending this my way for review.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[/u/botboy141/ 's writeup on orange citrus is good.  He noted some tangerine there that I don't disagree with.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/2zunm4/flavorah_flv_flavor_reviews_by_ubotboy141/)\n\n[I think this is the first time I like this stronger than ELR.  Pretty decent notes here.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/33040)\n\n[Good short take in a multi-flavor review of Vaping Underground: \"Orange citrus â€“ decent, but more of a candy flavor than a real citrus flavor. Not all that appealing on its own, but I can see it working well in the background in some mixes.\"](http://vapingunderground.com/threads/flavorah.59634/)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Orange Citrus","url":"https://redd.it/5hzkrr","vendor":{"name":"Flavorah","code":"FLV"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FLV","title":"Orange Citrus"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
