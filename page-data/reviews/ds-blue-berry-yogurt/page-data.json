Not much info are found on their website for the individual flavors. Although, they do state that their flavors are very concentrated.\n\n**Throat hit**: Low to medium throat hit here. I get a nice amount of \"itching\" in my throat, which is very pleasent.\n\n**Uses and pairings**: I actually find this concentrate perfect for a yogurt or in desserts where you needed a yogurt note. The blueberry in this yogurt will be the main base, but I can easily see it being mixed with other sweet fruits as well. Peach, mango, strawberry, raspberry and so forth comes to mind. I would maybe avoid citrus fruits here, but (and there is a but) and I can see it work very well with a sweeter citrus - like a sweet lemon! Should work perfectly fine for bakeries and custards as well, thanks to the very forward yogurt flavor, that adds a very good and round amount of cream. I find it be very good in a mix at 2.5-3% as a main note. 1% is closer to an accent and 5% is good for stand-alone.\n\n**Off-flavors**: I can't find any specific off-flavors in this concentrate. There are a hint of peel in from the blueberry, but that all boils down to wether you like that or not. It's so deeply hidden, that I can't see that being an issue and I find that it fits the flavor quite well. As stated above, you should probably keep it away from more sour/harsh flavors (TFA Sweet Tangerine, I'm looking at you here).\n\n**Notes**: Of the yogurts I have tried thus far, this one manages to hit the nail on the head. It's just about tangy enough to taste exactly as yogurt cup. The blueberry is both sweet and a little sour at the same time, which makes this flavor feel very natural and not candy-like. Nice round and smooth mouthfeel, as if you took a spoonful of blueberry yogurt right into your gob. I have zero issues vaping this as a stand-alone really.\n\n[**DIY\\_eJuice Flavor Reviews**](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)","author":"Kittybit8","title":"Blue Berry Yogurt","url":"https://redd.it/eqw1ei","vendor":{"name":"DuraSmoke","code":"DS"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"DS","title":"Blue Berry Yogurt"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
