There is an earthiness here that is rather subtle. i was really hoping for something similar to American Spirit Black cigarettes (my old cigs) but this needs a ton of help to get there...\n\nOff-flavors: sweet bell pepper... \n\nThroat hit: not very harsh, but not perfectly smooth either\n\nUses and Pairings: the only things i can think of are 1. small amounts to bring some realism to your cigar recipe and 2. that candied pepper recipe you always wanted to try, but were too afraid to attempt. i would suggest starting at .5-1% in a mix with other tobaccos and try it solo first to see what you get out of it.\n\n[Second opinions found here:](http://www.ecigexpress.com/diy-e-liquid/diy-e-liquid-flavors/flavourart-usa/flavourart-tobacco/perique-black-tobacco-by-flavourart.html)\nopinions range all over the place from analog cig to \"just chemicals\" \n\n\nEdit: added a little description to the flavor description.\n","author":"PerennialPhilosopher","title":"Perique Black","url":"https://redd.it/5whbhd","vendor":{"name":"Flavour Art","code":"FA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FA","title":"Perique Black"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
