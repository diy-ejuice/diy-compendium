I was prepared to wretch... but didn't. Sharp exhale, not too sharp though, but noticeably sharper than the FA Mozzarella I tried. Kind of a creamy melty cheddar taste going on. Much much better than I anticipated. If I had to guess as to the colour of the cheddar I'd lean more towards white than orange but not completely \"British tourist abroad\" pale.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Possible usage?** Stick in some AP at a high percentage, maybe something to fill out the cheese a bit more and you've got yourself a nachos with cheese vape here. I'm sure I read Reddit user /u/eyemakepizza is trying to make a pizza vape, I could see this fitting in there too.","author":"horrend","title":"Cheddar Cheese","url":"https://redd.it/agc403","vendor":{"name":"Flavour Art","code":"FA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FA","title":"Cheddar Cheese"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
