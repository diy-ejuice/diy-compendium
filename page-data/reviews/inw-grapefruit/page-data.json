There's something better!! Well let me change your mind, who doesn't like grapefruit slap some sugar on it and boom! It totally comes to life that citric fruit gets lifted and it takes on a completely new profile. So why not transfer this great fruit into your recipes.  \n\n\nINW grapefruit is awesome, it's totally on par with the real grapefruit. It smells lovely really bright plenty of tort, slightly sour but oh it's so Juicy and refreshing.  \n\nWhether grapefruit would get lost to some degree amongst other flavours in a recipe is I guess trial and error I can see it working with citrus fruits lemon,lime,orange,kiwi,apple but berries I'm not too sure.  \n\nDefinitely one to play with you could make this the party piece of your recipe if you choose the surrounding flavours correctly.  \n\n3% is flavoursome and I wouldn't go much higher you know it's strong just from smelling it. Definitely a great flavour should work in recipes and it's very refreshing as a Standalone go grab this and add to your arsenal.\n\n**Notes**  \n\nReal flavour, bright,sweet, tart,bitter,citric  \n\nStandalone 3-4%  \nIn a recipe0.5-2%  \n\n*Please if your opinion differs, or you have another review for this post it in the comments.
