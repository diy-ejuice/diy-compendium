Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Blueberry Muffin @ %1 and 3%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 13 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  More of a baked in blueberry flavor than a full blueberry muffin. Sweet, but not too overtly candy, blueberry right up front with a little bit of a darker, cooked, bakery volume without a lot of actual grain to it.  A bit weak for a flavorah bakery, seems to come into it's own at 3%.\n\nInhale is moderately dense, with a tart blueberry flavor.  Not a ton of sweetness there. Blueberry on the exhale is less tart but a lot sweeter. Not a lot of higher, floral top notes but a solid tart blueberry up there. Blueberry tastes cooked but not turned into jam. More like the vaguely purple parts of a muffin where the blueberry has leeched into the muffin. No real \"muffin\" taste here, but I'm definitely getting a hint of that kind of volume and dryness. Muffin mouthfeel if not the actual taste.  Fairly dense for being so blueberry forward.  Lingering blueberry top notes.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Not a whole lot of muffin here, so maybe that?\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light. Nothing crazy, but you know it's there.  At higher percentages, that blueberry has a bit of an edge to it.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This seems like one of those Flavorah flavors where you'll have to bring your own AP. That makes it a bit more useful. Your use is going to depend on what kind of base you want to bring in. Something like CAP Vanilla Cupcake for a sweeter blueberry muffin.  Maybe a bit of cookie if you want a denser, more cooked muffin.  Good blueberry note for waffles or pancakes.\n\nThe blueberry here doesn't need much help, but if you want to really hammer it home a syrupy blueberry like FLV Blueberry or something like FW Huckleberry will help add a lower end to the blueberry and moisten up the mix a bit.\n\nBecause the muffin is fairly light here, you could get away with using this in a straighter fruit mix for a sweet blueberry flavor, with some added bakery-like volume without actually tasting much muffin.\n\n**Notes:**  S&V concentration testing, this is pretty much just a bright, thin blueberry at 1% and under.  2% has quite a bit more body and that blueberry actually seems a bit less bright because of the volume. 3% is good, the blueberry flavor is full and that bakery volume complements it really well. 4% has a tarter edge to the blueberry, without any more of that bakery back-end.  5% seems to be losing some of the appeal, as that blueberry is getting a bit tart and picking up a bit of a boozy edge.  I'd recommend starting with this at 2% if you want a slightly more subtle blueberry, or 3% if you want the blueberry up front.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nFairly well documented, actually.\n\n[Here are the infamous deleted user's quick tasting notes: \"Sweet, cooked blueberry. Subtle overall flavor. Has deeper notes but no punch. Clean/no off flavors. Donâ€™t really get muffin notes at all.  Try using to round out berry flavors and add bottom ripeness. Very subtle vape on its own. Oddly this flavor stimulates mild salivation. Might work to make bakery/fruit mixes juicier.\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/30itrg/my_flv_tasting_notes_blueberry_muffin/)\n\n[And here's botboy: \"Pretty awesome for a pre-mix flavor concentrate, still off the mark from an ideal Blueberry Muffin vape that I've been working on for god knows how long. This will definitely play a major roll in my continued effort to perfect a blueberry muffin vape though. 5% standalone was plenty strong, predominately blueberry with hints of muffin likeness in the background. Could go as low as 3% standalone and probably get the same result.\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/2zunm4/flavorah_flv_flavor_reviews_by_ubotboy141/)\n\n[Here's the ELR Page, fairly well reviewed there (although a lot of copies of that deleted user note.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/33041)\n\n[Heres the FLV Product Page. Their description: \"Sweet and soft like it just came out of the oven.  This flavor is a standard savory flavor for vaping. Distinct from our straight blueberry.\"  Postive reviews on there, as well.](http://store.flavorah.com/concentrated-blueberry-muffin-flavor)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Blueberry Muffin","url":"https://redd.it/653oqj","vendor":{"name":"Flavorah","code":"FLV"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FLV","title":"Blueberry Muffin"}},
