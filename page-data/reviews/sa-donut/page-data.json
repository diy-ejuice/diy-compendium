It isn't quite as sweet as something like Zeppola but does have a bit of sweetness and has a bit of yeasty taste but not nearly as off putting as FA Joy. \n\n**Off-flavors:**  Right after a shake it was very yeasty and greasy tasting, almost had that play dough type taste to it but steeped out quite nicely.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Very minimal\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This is a complete donut just waiting for your favorite fruit toppings or creams for a cream filled donut. I can see pairing this with zeppola for a bit more sweetness or maybe even flv maple bar for a maple donut. \n\n**Notes:**\nThis flavor changed quite a bit with a steep. When I tried it after a shake it was awful, very yeasty tasting similar to joy or cap glazed donut. After it steeped it turned into a well balanced complete donut flavor.\n\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**\n\nIf you have different opinions on the flavor or any ideas on how to use it please post them in the comments.
