TFA Did a really good job of nailing this fruity profile down. It's got that really soft pear sweetness, and a bit of brightness that you'd expect from an apple to really bring it to the front. Because of this, it sweetens a fruity profile wonderfully. This concentrate is VERY strong, very noticeable even when used at 0.25%. It can also easily overtake a mix, so you'll typically want to use a light touch when mixing with it. \n\n**On the Nose**  \nSmells like Quince. Like a sweet bright pear.\n\n**Recommended Usage**  \n*Stand alone*: 0.5-1%\n\n*In a mix*: 0.25-0.75%. \n\n**Throat**  \nMild to Moderate\n\n**Ideal Pairings**  \nPear, apple, tropical fruits, bright fruits, melon, light creams\n\n**Avoid**  \nOnly thing I can really think of is coffee\n\n**Steep**  \n1-3 Days, flavor does mellow out a bit with a steep.\n\n**Recipe Idea: [Pearapple](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/9808)**  \n*Ratio: 15PG/85VG*  \n*Steep: Good as SnV; ideal 2 days* \n\n**Ingredient**|**%**|\n:--|:--|\nTFA Pear|3%|\nTFA Quince|0.25%|\nTFA Pineapple|0.75%|\nINW Pineapple|2.5%|\nEM @ 10%|1.5%|\n\n\nIn this recipe TFA Quince is acting as an accent to the Pear to help combat the very forward flavor of pineapple and bring the pear a bit more to the front. This is a great sort of base for a pear and pineapple, goes great with Kiwi and some Koolada too.
