Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Decadent Vapours Red Tab, 5% and 10%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 56 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Thick vanilla with a light tobacco accent.\n\nThat’s a lot of very, thick rich vanilla.  It almost vapes like vanilla frosting.  Not a juice that tastes like vanilla frosting, but actual vanilla frosting.  It’s almost disconcertingly thick and full.  Vanilla feels a bit bright and commercial as opposed to something darker and spicy.  Pretty distinct buttery richness though, with a moderately heavy coconut note to it.\n\nDV calls out vanilla and tobacco and they are both definitely in there. The tobacco here is a bit dirty with some of that classic absolute ash note.  The tobacco itself isn’t all that prominent though.  It’s a light enough touch and that vanilla is bold enough that it’s working as an accent.  It’s like dirty vanilla ice cream.  Some drier, hay notes underneath everything but it’s pretty well lost in that vanilla.\n\nMouthfeel really is very thick.  Seems more buttery and rich than oversweet, but definitely lands on the dessert side of tobacco even with those light ashy notes.\n\n**Off-Flavors:**  I get a pretty solid coconut off-note out of this.  Not unpleasant, but maybe a bit weird.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Nah.  Super smooth.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 5%, vanilla is still thick and smooth.   Tobacco is pretty light here, and tastes more like hay than ash.\n\nAt 10%, that vanilla is crazy thick and I’m getting a pretty rich buttery note.  Coconut is a lot more noticeable here.  Tobacco accents have gotten a bit dirtier but still haven’t really taken over.\n\nDV has their 20% suggestion, but I’m good lower than that.  Just based on these tests, I’d probably be using around 10% solo.  I’d be more likely to use it an accent though, probably around 6%.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  With that really heavy, thick vanilla this would make a killer vanilla for a pipe tobacco mix.  It’s going to need a hell of steep, but I threw some INW Black for Pipe in one of the testers and it seems to be working really well.  Those ashier, dirty notes aren’t really clashing with the vanilla as much as I’d think.\n\nBeyond just a pipe tobacco, a smaller percentage could work up against a nuttier tobacco or something with chocolate notes like FLV Red Burley.  Caramel would help dessert this up even a bit more.  You could do a pretty neat vanilla RY4.\n\nIn general, I’d call this more of a vanilla additive for tobaccco mixes as opposed to a solo flavor, unless you really like the idea of a frosting tobacco.  I mean, i’m not opposed to that.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  [This apparently used to be part of the DV Djinni line.  Vaping with Vic has a review up for the finished version of their Red Tab Juice.
