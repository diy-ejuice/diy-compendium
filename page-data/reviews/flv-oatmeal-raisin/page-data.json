Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing**: FLV Oatmeal Raisin @ .5% & 3% 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 1 day, 3% Steeped 1 week.\n\n**Flavor Description**: When used at .5% you get a predominantly raisin flavor from it with some more mellow baked oatmeal cookie notes in the background. It has a light brown sugary butter note that goes very well with the oatmeal flavor. It needs some help on the cookie side of it though. The raisin tastes inline to a dark fruit baked flavor that seems faithful to what it is suppose to be. This is a good base to work with if you're wanting to make a oatmeal raisin type flavor. It tastes pretty good even though it's just a tad bit unbalanced between the oatmeal and the raisin.\n\nAt 2.5%-3% this is absolutely rancid. You get a disgusting raisin taste that lingers in your tank/RDA similar to TFA Honeydew. Not much to say for this percentage because you simply do not want/need to use this flavor at this high of a percentage.\n\n\n**Off Flavors**: The raisin flavor can be a little more forward than you might like but nothing you wouldn't expect to taste from this flavor.\n\n**Throat Hit**: Nothing at .5%-3%.\n\n**Notes**: First impressions were this flavor smells putrid. It's very off putting when you take a whiff from the bottle. This is a strong flavor that will over take everything in a mix if used too high. Keep this low; .25%-75% would be my recommendation. \n\n\n**Second Opinions**:\n\n[Bullcityflavors review](http://www.bullcityflavors.com/oatmeal-raisin-flv/) - *This flavor smells strong out of the bottle. Smells almost overwhelming. It is a super turn off until you try it. I had it sitting around for 2 months because I was honestly put off. I mixed it at .25% and it is amazing. Wonderful oatmeal raisin cookie taste. Mix with custard, vanilla, marshmallow, frosting. Super good!!!*\n\n\n[Alltheflavors](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/22923#grandma_s_oatmeal_raisin_cookies_by_krucial) has a recipe using it that I tried. All I could taste was a disgusting raisin mess; I personally think 2.5% is way too much.\n\nI recommend this recipe a lot more.\n\n**Oatmeal Raisin Cookies & Cream** - All Flavorah\n\n1% Marshmallow\n\n1% Cotton Candy\n\n1% Custard\n\n.75% Vanilla Custard\n\n.5% Cream\n\n.5% Vanilla Pudding\n\n.5% Oatmeal Raisin\n\n.25% Macaroon","author":"chewymidget","title":"Oatmeal Raisin","url":"https://redd.it/628719","vendor":{"name":"Flavorah","code":"FLV"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FLV","title":"Oatmeal Raisin"}},
