Fast forward to 2018 when I got into DIY, my first clone attempt was Hawk Sauce, which was fairly simple, but I definitely wanted to replicate my old favorite. I ended up trying a lot of different things and gave up on the original, instead going for my own peach green tea recipe, [Shinto](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/122804#shinto_by_selev).\n\nLast week I checked MtBakerVapor to see if they still sold it, but I learned from their chat support that it was discontinued. I ended up sending an email asking if it was possible to get the recipe, and got this response:\n\n> You have been on quite an adventure working on replicating this flavor. I was able to find the recipe but it is on a document from 2013 when we were not the most scientific group of guys. So things were measured in units of the tools we used back then. All the sheet showed me was a 2 next to each flavor name. So equal parts of each flavor. Flavorwest flavorings you typically want to go 15-20% flavoring to base ratio. \n\n> You are going to want equal parts of: Dragon Fruit, Mango, and White Tea. \nhttps://www.flavorwest.com/water-soluble-flavoring/dragon-fruit.html\nhttps://www.flavorwest.com/mango-natural.html\nhttps://www.flavorwest.com/white-tea.html\n\n> This should get you close. I know later in history we recreated it with another flavor manufacturer. I do not remember if we made any tweaks at that time or not. This should get you off to a close start in recreating that old favorite of yours. \n\n> We appreciate all the support. We have been exploring doing limited runs of some of the old favorites but nothing is concrete yet. \n\n> I hope I was able to help a bit.\n\nThere were next to no reviews to see for FW White Tea, surprisingly. It had been around this long and no reviews? So, here's my first flavor review for the compendium.\n\n---------------------------------\n\nSetup: Falcon 2 on an Aegis Legend at 46W\n\nPG/VG: 65/35\n\nTested at 0.5%, 1%, 1.5%, and 2%, steeped 1 day.\n\nDescription: Soft, white tea flavor with gentle floral notes of honeysuckle and elderflower, and noticeable honey sweetness. \n\n0.5%: Throat hit 1/10, like a very neutral tea, very fluffy, just slightly sweet but in a very natural, herbal fashion (honeysuckle?)\n\n1%: Getting clear notes of honey in the tea. 2/10 throat hit. This is a good spot for a primary or secondary in a recipe.\n\n1.5%: The perfect sweet spot for a prime flavor in the recipe. Just enough tea, floral notes, honey sweetness, 2/10 throat hit. \n\n2%: Now about 3/10 throat hit, pronounced honey notes, still enjoyable but very faint yet noticeable off-notes of metal/cardboard. Do not pass.\n\nPairings: Citrus, creams, florals, menthol. Imagine there's other amazing uses one could do with it. I feel that it could take on a neutral tea base for any recipe.\n\nYou'll probably see me post soon in the future with a Dream Tea clone.","author":"heimsins_konungr","title":"White Tea","url":"https://redd.it/h03r2x","vendor":{"name":"Flavor West","code":"FW"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FW","title":"White Tea"}},
