Example: Guiness, which is a dark and bitter beer, also has a creamy mouth feel.)\n\n**Off Flavors:**\n\n- none\n\n**Position In A Recipe:**\n\n- middle note\n- main part of a flavor profile\n- could work as a top note too at around 1%\n\n**Pairings:**\n\n- other tobaccos\n- cream\n- custard\n- touch of vanilla\n\n**Suggested Percentage:**\n\n- 3-4%\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- Tobacco heads rejoice! Definite keeper!\n- This flav is up there with Red Burley and gets my full seal of approval.\n- Can easily be vaped as a stand alone and of course will be great in a mix. I've gone through about 60mL stand alone and still enjoying.\n- Add to your analog cig or pipe recipe, or drop the percentage to 1% and mix with your favorite cigar flavorings.\n- I see this appealing primarily to the hardcore tobacco heads out there but for those that like it a bit sweet then throw in some cream and a touch of vanilla.\n\n**Suggested Recipe:**\n\n- Kinnikinnick does not mess around with his baccos. I haven't mixed this recipe yet but it looks like a nice starting point for getting to know Kentucky a lil more.\nhttp://e-liquid-recipes.com/recipe/660865/Kentucky%20Fire%20Cured%20Custard\n\n**A Note On Kentucky vs Red Burley:**\n\nFor those that have tried Red Burley.. in comparison, Kentucky Blend feels lighter and brighter, yet equally as complex. While Red Burley is sort of earthy, and cocoa-y, Kentucky Blend brings some spice into the mix. The two would pair nicely and there is one note in both that's similar which I can't put my finger on. Overall, they're very different though and both deserve their place in my magical mystery box of wondrous temptations.","author":"T_Mace","title":"Kentucky Blend","url":"https://redd.it/599vl2","vendor":{"name":"Flavorah","code":"FLV"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FLV","title":"Kentucky Blend"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
