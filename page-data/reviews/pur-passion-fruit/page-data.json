Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Purilum Passion Fruit, 3 and 8%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 7 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Syrupy passion fruit flavor. I get some sort of mix of yellow peach, sweet guava, and maybe a candy strawberry.  Nothing much in the way of tart notes beyond the edges of the inhale, and no real acidic, bright edge.  Thicker syrupy mouthfeel and very little in the way of harshness.  Seems like a pretty solid passionfruit for bakeries or anything using a passionfruit syrup.  Also would probably blend with damn near any fruit without an issue, and the lack of acidity makes it an option with heavier creams or mixes with stronger dairy notes. Pretty linear, I'd use this around 4% for an accent, but would probably blend into a lot of fruit based flavors up to 6% without calling too much attention to itself.  Primary note usage is probably a bit higher at around 8%.\n\nInhale is sweet and I do get some mild tarter mouthfeel. Inhale tastes very yellow peach to me, without going full on into peach rings. Moderately dense, but it does seem to have a bit syrupy stickiness to it. Exhale is a bit more complex with an initial burst of peach, then something that tastes a lot like CAP Sweet Guava. Maybe just a bit of tartness in the top notes but it's pretty light and the actually fruit base is pretty heavy and warm. Back half of the exhale picks up a strawberry or kiwi candy kind of vibe.  Some light harshness, but nothing major. Some tartness shows back up on the tail end of the exhale after that syrupy fruit calms down a bit.  Lingering sugar lips and some the tarter part of this makes your lips just a bit raw after some prolonged vaping.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  I don't have a ton of experience with less processed passionfruit, but this doesn't really have that tarter edge and bright acidity that is probably closer to a fresh or minimally processed passionfruit.  Nothing here tastes off or unpleasant though. \n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light.  Not in the same universe as FA Throat Razors, but has a bit of a bite to it.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Kind of another rorschach test of a fruit.  I'm pretty sure you can find almost any kind of fruit note you need in this if you look hard enough.  I don't think there are many fruits that wouldn't go well with this.  I'd say citrus would be a good pairing to try to add back in some tarter notes.  Also would work well as a kind of non-descript tropical background noise in mixes.\n\nDoesn't really have anything floral or green, so should blend a bit better with creams than CAP passionfruit, and doesn't have the bright acidity that FA has which gets weird with buttery notes.\n\nSeems like a pretty good choice for a passion fruit syrup in cocktail/beverage vapes and may actually work well in bakery application.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, this comes across as pretty linear.  Kind of soft and non-descript at 3%. Definitely tastes fruity but it's a bit hard to figure out what's going on. A bit bolder and sweeter at 5% but maybe just a hair light for a primary note. 7% still doesn't have anything floral or weird, and I'm maybe getting a bit of that tartness but it's balanced out by a really heavy sweetness. At 9% this is starting to feel a bit blown out and oversweet, and it's picking up a bitter edge.  I'd use this up to about 7-8% as a primary note, but it should be pretty flexible as an accent. I don't think it will really disagree or dominate clearer fruit profiles, so probably around 4-6% depending on how much sweetness you want.\n\nThe passion fruits I'm most acquainted with are Capella, and Flavourart. I'd say this skews closer to the Capella side of things, but a bit sweeter. Capella has that same slightly candy edge to it and seems to have a heavier white gummy bear/dragonfruit/candy pineapple flavor along with something that tastes a bit more floral and green as well. Flavourart is bright, tart, and acidic and has a tendency to rip up throats.  This isn't a unpleasant flavor by any means, but it doesn't deliver on the pipe dream of something that captures that tart brightness without wrecking my throat.  Tasting them side by side, will probably replace CAP passion fruit for me.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[One, again very positive, note on ELR from user \"juice junkie\": \"10 out of 10! Great Passion Fruit flavor! I really want to add some Strawberry, Orange, and Pomelo to it and have a tropical punch type vape! Itâ€™s a really good stand alone flavor! Reminds me of FA Passion Fruit with a little bit of FLV guava added to it. \"](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/86633)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Passion Fruit","url":"https://redd.it/6x612e","vendor":{"name":"Purilum","code":"PUR"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"PUR","title":"Passion Fruit"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
