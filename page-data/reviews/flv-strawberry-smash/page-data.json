It seems like FLV Strawberry filling without the sweet jammy quality, or like FLV strawberry without the shoe flavor. This does have a bit of floral and medicinal quality to it, but it isn't dominating my palette, but the strawberry flavor isn't very potent either. This seems like more trouble than it is worth for the most part, there are many strawberry flavors that will do exactly what this will do only better.\n\n**Off-flavors:** I do not get any strong off-flavors, perhaps just a hint of floral medicine that will probably come out over 1%. Interestingly, Jen Jarvis does a video review (link below) where she describes almost nothing but off-flavors.\n\n**Throat Hit:** This one has a bit of harshness compared to the other FLV strawberries, but nothing too bad.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:** This seems like a decent match for creams/custards, but I would keep this low (<1%) and support it with other strawberries. Not great solo, but not disgusting either IMO. ATF average % of use is 2%, but I wouldn't go that high. It seems like pushing the % to get more strawberry out of this will yield strange off-flavors, while keeping it low will require supporting strawberries.\n\n**Notes:** This concentrate was provided by /u/ConcreteRiver for me to test. It seems like overall, the FLV Strawberries are extremely subjective flavors, so if you decide to pick any of them up it would be wise to single flavor test them so that you can see how your taste buds like them.\n\n**Second Opinions:** [Flavorah product description:](http://store.flavorah.com/concentrated-strawberry-smash-flavor) Dynamic and full strawberry notes. Not overly candy in tone, but bright and brilliant enough for a candy flavor. Rich enough to pull down into a custard or cream base.\n\n [Jennifer Jarvis made a video review:](https://youtu.be/wcVsNWtYFiA) Her tests were done at 1.5-3%. I will sum up her opinion: do not use this flavor. I personally didn't get the off-flavors as bad in my test, but I'm no supertaster either. also worth noting that I used a slightly lower %.\n\n","author":"PerennialPhilosopher","title":"Strawberry Smash","url":"https://redd.it/6cv7v8","vendor":{"name":"Flavorah","code":"FLV"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FLV","title":"Strawberry Smash"}},
