This here is the most amazing and best coconut I've vaped in my life and I've tried so many. The boys from VTA have not created a flavouring, they've created a tribute to Coconut flavour. \n\nTested on a Zenith 0.8 ohm coil, Kanthal ones I believe, with Vaporesso's Gen's Pulse mode and VW mode. Quick mention of how awesome pulse mode is with fruits and with cooling, triple awesome with cooling tbf. \n\n% used: 3%\n\nI never bothered reading the \"pairs well with\" etc briefs so I'll just cut to the chase. \n\nThis flavour is absolutely insane, I can't stress how accurate it feels. It feels like pure bliss vaping it since the inhale is one, bringing a nice warm rounded body of a coconut and with the exhale you actually get the sharp notes. It smells absolutely fantastic and my room has never smelled better. Most coconut flavours I've tried other than FA's coconut have failed miserably either in smell being pungent and horrid or by being super sweet. This is the PERFECT amount of sweetness on its own, the perfect vape feeling with such delicious full bodied smoothness it just spreads through your mouth and throat in a perfect velvet smooth feeling. \n\nGuys, I really don't know what else to say, this is the best coconut flavour I've personally tried and I highly recommend everyone who's a fan of coconut to get it. \n\nI love VTA. Incredibly authentic flavours, they should just rebrand to Vape Train Authentic rather than Australia.\n\nDisclaimer: I know this isn't a great review or even a good one, but I'm seriously stunned by how absolutely amazing this coconut is. More VTA reviews coming up this week btw, got a few more of their flavourings steeping.\n\nP.S: VTA = VT in the USA afaik, just wrote it down as I see it in case it has a slightly different name like most vape juices have (looking at you FA with your 50 different words instead of just \"strawberry lime.\")\n\nEdit 1: 1.5% is apparently a no go due to resembling sun tan lotion as shown in [this comment here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/ho6lf4/vta_coconut_its_a_damn_masterpiece_get_it/fxuoiyf)!
