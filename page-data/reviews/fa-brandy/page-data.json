    "result": {"data":{"reviewsJson":{"markdown":"**Setup:** Plume Veil RDA; dual parallel @ .40Î©; cotton wicks; 50W\n\n**Testing:** FA Brandy @ 2%; Aged: 17 days\n\n**Flavor description:**  Seems to carry a frosting or cream taste on the tongue with a sweet white wine and light candied nuance in the background.  Surprisingly dense, similar to a light cream, not overly thick.  I would say it is definitely a bit creamy with faint notes of apple or maybe white grape?\n\n**Off-flavors:** Sharp and alcohol-like initially, but really smooths out after a steep.\n\n**Throat hit:** 4/10 (after 1 week steep)\n\n**Uses:**  A candied or baked accent to fruits @0.5-2%.  Works well in sprucing up bakeries and desserts.\n\n**Pairings:**  Your favorite fruits. Also, custards, creams, brown sugar, cinnamon. \n\n**Notes:**   I've been putting off this review because I don't know exactly how to describe the flavor, as it isn't really a full on boozy \"brandy\" taste, and I can't really identify the fruit(s) because they are extremely light.  The creaminess also confused me.  I've dripped almost 10mL of this in the past week and am still kind of unsure how this got named \"FA Brandy\", as I was hoping for it to steep into a more defined taste.  I am hoping others can add to it below.  Anyone tried this standalone at 4-5% or under 1%?\n\nEDIT: I want to note that some individuals at ELR state that this can be used in place of FA Liquid Amber.  I do not believe this to be true, as the Liquid Amber carries a lot more of a fermented fruit and tart taste without seeming remotely creamy.\n\nEDIT 2: [Link to all of our flavor reviews in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)","author":"wh1skeyk1ng","title":"Brandy","url":"https://redd.it/4sdt7m","vendor":{"name":"Flavour Art","code":"FA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FA","title":"Brandy"}},
