Moderately dense 6 out of 10. With a creamy mouth feel.\n\n**Throat Hit**\n2/10\n\n**Flavor Properties**\n\nCreamy with a slightly sharp sour note. Slightly browned butter note with a hint of nut, no perceptible vanilla. \n\n**Relatable Flavors**\n\nReminds me of a very weak thin Greek yogurt . It's more like a Greek yogurt made into a smoothie with plenty of extra Dairy.\n\n**Position In The Recipe**\n\nDense enough to be a base note but light enough to come across as an accent for other yogurts as well. Definitely not strong enough to fill out the top note position unless you are using a strictly Dairy profile.\n\n**Off Flavors**\n\nFlavoring has a lingering unpleasant aftertaste.\n\n**Pairings**\n\nShould pair nicely with all fruits creams chocolates bakeries and if you spice flavorings such as vanilla cinnamon.\n\n**Notes**\n\nThere are many Greek yogurt flavorings out there fw did a very nice job with this one. Mixers of all experience levels should be able to utilize this flavoring. Compared to other yogurts not nearly as dense, or sour.\n\n**Rating**\n\n80/100\n\n","author":"Chrisdvr1","title":"Greek Yogurt","url":"https://redd.it/5titi0","vendor":{"name":"Flavor West","code":"FW"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FW","title":"Greek Yogurt"}},
