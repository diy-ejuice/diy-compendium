I'm vaping this on a Pulse RDA 0.25ohms 45 watts NI and KA single fused clapton. This one is a little light at this percentage. The raspberry is really nice and sweet. Its not overbearing or floral at all. The soda is nice and sweet with some minor vanilla notes to it. The apricot is a nice touch and for me it lingers in the background. Its different but I really like it. I'm not one to pick apricot out at a flavor but it really does something with this mix. Its a nice sweet flavor that almost reminds me of a peach but its a tad more tart than a peach. I think the apricot adds to the sweetness of this flavor. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI will likely finish this 15ml tester up and mix this again at 6%. The only other flavors I could really imagine adding to this flavor is peach or a good tea flavor. This is really good as is. I can't wait to try this in my favorite tea flavor!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI remixed this at 6% this morning. I'm super impressed at the difference. The apricot has come more alive than it was before. It still has that sweet sort peach taste to it. The raspberry seems to be more in the background. The raspberry is still the same with no off notes. It is just a nice sweet raspberry taste. This flavor like this almost reminds me of a gummy bear. It has great mouthfeel to it. I have already gone through 10mls of this juice on the Pulse RDA! \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen I mixed this at 4% I gave it 4 out of 5 stars. Now that I mixed it at 6% I gave it 5 out of 5 stars!","author":"juice_junkie","title":"Soda Berry","url":"https://redd.it/9tyc2h","vendor":{"name":"MolinBerry","code":"MB"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"MB","title":"Soda Berry"}},
