Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** RF SC Chocolate Chip Cookie @ 1% and 2.5%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 13 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Chocolate Chip Cookies, but a really thin and light version. More like cookie crisp cereal than a more solid full bakery flavor. Clear, but pretty restrained chocolate note pushing chemical at higher percentages, and a thinner base without much texture. Even at higher percentages I'm missing a lot of richer, deeper flavors out of this.  Barring some sort of cookie crisp cereal vape, I'd have trouble using this as a full cookie, and i'm not sure if it brings enough of a bridge to really count as vital in building a flavor around.  Flavor seems to come together at 2% and tops out by 3%.\n\nInhale is mostly sharp, chemical chocolate. It builds as you inhale though, as opposed to being all up front. Moderately dense up top, but airy in the base with maybe some light, flat cookie notes.  Exhale has a clearer, if still light cookie taste right up front and the chocolate here is pretty well balanced. Back of the exhale kind of falls apart a bit, and that chocolate kind of builds up in the back of my throat and gets a bit harsh. Not particularly sweet, dense, or rich. Like vaping the air from a box of cookie crisp.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Texture-wise, this doesn't line up with what I want out of a bakery vape.  It's thin and kind of insubstantial. That chocolate note also gets chemical and bitter up towards 3%.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Exhale has a bit of sting on the back of the throat from that chocolate. Moderate?\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I'm struggling a bit with this one. There's simultaneously a lot going on, none of it is really noteworthy, and there isn't a lot of body behind any of it.\n\nI don't get enough texture to use as a texturizer for softer bakeries.  That chocolate note is a bit thin, weird, and artificial and so I wouldn't use it to just add chocolate to a mix. There's not a deeper richness to butter up other bakeries.\n\nI think to use it as a chocolate chip cookie, you'd need a cookie base, and chocolate, and you might as well leave this out because it doesn't do either of those all that well.\n\n**Notes:**  This is fairly non-existent at 1%, kind of smelling stale chocolate chip cookies. 2% has a clearer, sharp kind of chocolate chip taste to it, but there isn't much bakery underneath. 2.5% has that same chocolate chip taste, but I can already taste it getting a bit bitter and chemical. Some body, but it's really cardboard-y. Not really rich or crunchy, it's just there. 3% has an even more aggressive chemical note to the chocolate, and the body isn't really doing anything for me. 4% is pretty distinctly bitter and chemical.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[ELR page for the VG Version, people are calling it weak at 10% in VG, which is pretty par for the course. I'd go so far as to call the SC version weak as well.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/92180)\n\n[Here's the product page from Real Flavors.
