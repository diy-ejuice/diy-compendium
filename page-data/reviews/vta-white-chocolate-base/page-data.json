This flavour can be utilised in an array of styles from creamy milk chocolate, to a dessert and bakery styled eliquid recipe. Pairing is made simple with fruits and or other creamy bases.\" Their suggested usage range is SOLO:5-9%. MIXED:2-5%  They also say 3-6 day steep.\n\n**6%:** It smells amazingly accurate to a white chocolate and the knuckle test is very similar to a white chocolate. Freshly mixed wasn't much flavor at all. After a week some white chocolate and cream coming through. At 2 weeks it seems fully steep full flavor white chocolate like note, some creaminess, and a sour like cream cheese note. No strange off notes other than the cream cheese. It is slightly dry but not harsh. Has a decent bodied mouthfeel.\n\n**9%:** White chocolate is amplified, also getting a milk chocolate like note, sour cream cheesy note is more noticeable. No harshness, but it is still a bit dry, and still has medium bodied mouthfeel.\n\n**Pairings:** Fruits, creams & bakeries. Just make sure not to use with anything that is dry or harsh because it will make the VT White Chocolate even drier which will be very unpleasant. \n\n**Conclusion:** VTA's suggested usage seems about right. Off notes would be @9%. I got a bit of a milk chocolate as well as the white chocolate. The cream cheese would also be an off flavor being that it is not a note people would get from eating white chocolate.  It was slightly dry and has the cream cheese note you may have to cover up if it is not wanted. Also think that adding some vanilla and some more creams. You make a good vanilla white chocolate mousse style recipe.\n","author":"ebc88","title":"White Chocolate Base","url":"https://redd.it/89qr55","vendor":{"name":"Vape Train Australia","code":"VTA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"VTA","title":"White Chocolate Base"}},
