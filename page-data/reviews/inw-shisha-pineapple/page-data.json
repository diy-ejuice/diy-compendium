I love pineapple and this is just to artificial.  \n\nNo real flavour no Juicy mouthfeel very weak and somehow comes across plastic it's just weird!!  \n\nMaybe a slighter higher % and some sweetener could maybe wake this up or add it to another pineapple and see if they play off each other.  \n\nOn a whole don't bother with this one my search for a better pineapple continues,however I'm sure there's a place maybe for it and again probably recipes we will just have to see.\n\n**Notes**  \n\nArtificial, plastic, unsweetened, bland  \n\nStandalone 4-6%  \nIn a recipe 0.5-3%  \n\n*Please if your opinion differs, or you have another review for this post it in the comments. Will help the master list with multiple reviews in one spot.*","author":"CheebaSteeba","title":"Shisha Pineapple","url":"https://redd.it/4rh1wx","vendor":{"name":"Inawera","code":"INW"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"INW","title":"Shisha Pineapple"}},
