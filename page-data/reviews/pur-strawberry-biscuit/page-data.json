It lingers a bit on the tongue, and has a very sweet juicy aroma. In the back you can taste a little bit of one of those fluffy baking soda style home baked biscuits. This is NOT a cookie style biscuit. Then it's drizzled with just a touch of sweet cream salted butter. The flavor is definitely strawberry dominate, and the biscuit is amazingly authentic, although I'd like a bit more of it.  This has a nice body and mouth feel to it, definitely not flat tasting.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:** None\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit:** 3/10\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Pairings:** Kiwi, banana, other berries. whipped cream, butter, butter cream, cakes, custards, frosting, milk/dairy.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Notes:** I get a lot of strawberry accented with a very small amount of biscuit, and I'd rather have it the other way. I want the full sized biscuit accented with the strawberry. But even through the strong strawberry, the first thing I think of when vaping it is a hot, fresh baked strawberry scone. I'm going to add a bit of Purilum Butter Cream to bring that forward more, and maybe try just a drop of AP to try to bring out the biscuit. I actually think it's a bit strong for me at 9% as well, even though other users have said they like it up to 12%. I'm going to go down to 5-6% as a single flavor and see if it balances out a little better.\n\n&nbsp;","author":"mysticrosell","title":"Strawberry Biscuit","url":"https://redd.it/5rthi1","vendor":{"name":"Purilum","code":"PUR"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"PUR","title":"Strawberry Biscuit"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
