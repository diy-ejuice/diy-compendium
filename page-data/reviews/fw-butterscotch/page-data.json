Very milky and buttery, I think butyric acid is used here for butteryness. Notes of brown sugar and vanilla. Not candy like whatsoever, this is a butterscotch cream if anything.  I like it as a standalone. \n\n**Off-flavors**: Butyric acid, just needs to steep a couple days but it can be a bit funky as a shake and vape. Reminds me of FLV Pistachio because of how creamy it is and the butyric acid taste. \n\n**Throat Hit**: Kind of perfect, I get a minimal throat hit when hitting this a couple times in a row. Nothing scratchy but its there. 5/10\n\n**Uses**: I would use this as a base for a butterscotch cookie or ice cream at 4-5%. Can lend some creamy and buttery qualities at lower % but I have not worked extensively with it. \n\n**Pairings**: Bakery and Creams forever. Other Butterscotch, Caramel, coffee, tobacco, nuts, and some fruits like banana, apple/pear, coconut and maybe apricots.\n\n**Notes**: This is my first butterscotch flavoring. I wanted to use it for an ice cream flavor and Iâ€™ve got a good start on one. \n\n**Butterscotch Ice Cream Cone**\n\nFlavor\tVendor\t%\n\n*Butterscotch (Natural)\tFW\t4\n\n*Caramel \tFA\t1\n\n*Vanilla Bean Ice Cream\tTPA\t6\n\n*TPA brown sugar extra .5\n\n*Biscuit\tJF\t0.65\n\t\t\n\n**Second Opinions**:\nu/ThirdWorldOrder used it in a recipe back in January seems good at 4%\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/434rii/first_recipe_post_butterscotch_please_be_gentle/\n\nGood Reviews on BullCity and FW site.. no flavor reviews here yet.\nhttp://flavorwest.com/index.php/butterscotch.html\n\nhttp://www.bullcityflavors.com/natural-butterscotch-fw/\n\n**Rating** (88/100)\n\n*Upcoming Reviews: FW Blood Orange Natural, FW Mango Natural and FA Lychee.*\n\n\nedit: PG% \nedit2: added rating\nedited recipe","author":"HashSlingingSlashur","title":"Butterscotch","url":"https://redd.it/5i75od","vendor":{"name":"Flavor West","code":"FW"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FW","title":"Butterscotch"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
