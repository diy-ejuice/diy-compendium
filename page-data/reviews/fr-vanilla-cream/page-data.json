Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Flavor Revolution Vanilla Cream, 1% and 3%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 33 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Light, fluffy vanilla whipped cream.  Does most of the things that [FR Cream is trying to do](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/7wkal0/flavor_revolution_cream/), but a bit more successful at it.\n\nAgain, more vanilla than cream here.  Where the vanilla from their normal cream seemed a bit bitter and dry, the vanilla here is a bit fuller without necessarily being all that much more aggressive.  Pretty mellow, lighter vanilla.  Nothing dark, robust or spicy, but a softer frosting type vanilla.  Kind of struggling to find anything really \"creamy\" here.  Very light richness, but nothing that tastes all the much like a cream.  Definitely nothing funky or buytric.\n\nTexture is light and fluffy, without some of the more pronounced dryness from the normal FR Cream. Pretty insubstantial, but in a good way.  Full but light mouthfeel, with no weirder dead spots.  Slightly rich base, slightly dry middle, and a fairly vibrant top end with all the vanilla.  Feels very much like an extremely light whipped cream.  Feels fairly sweet with as light of a mouthfeel as it has. Keeps from going cloying mostly from that lightness. \n\nComparing this to some of the other available whipped creams, this seems maybe a bit lighter and more delicate.  If CAP Vanilla Whipped Cream and FW Sweet Cream both have that richer, fattier base like a whipped cream, this can feel a bit more like Kool-Whip (or your whipped non-dairy topping of choice.)  Same basic effect but not as robust.\n\n**Off-Flavors:**  Nah, not really.  Fluffier, lighter texture if you were expecting a thicker, richer cream.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  I'm not getting much of a hit.  Maybe some slight dryness, but pretty minor.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 1%, this doesn't really stand out to me.  Lighter, wispy vanilla with a pretty neutral body.\n\nAt 3%, some of the richness starts to show up.  Vanilla is solid but not overbearing. Fluffy texture, with just a light hint of dryness.\n\nJust based on these tests, I'd probably be a bit higher than the suggested 2% on this one.  I'd be using this around 3-4% as a whipped cream layer or accent for stronger, dryer flavors.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I'd use this for the light whipped cream instead of trying to make it richer.  Good with brighter fruits like strawberries as a whipped cream layer.\n\nWould also pair well with lighter cake bases like FW White Cake or WF Princess Cake.\n\nIn the comments for FR Cream, patg55 talked about pairing FR Cream with FLV Cream to tag some more flavor onto that thicker body and bending FLV Frosting to lighten it up a bit.  While FR Cream wouldn't be my choice for that, I think this concentrate would do a great job of that.\n\n**Second Opinions:**  Can't really find any other notes on this.\n\n[Here's the product page from Nicotine River.  Their description: \"The one and only Vanilla Cream! Smooth Vanilla meets a sweet, light Cream!\"  Still pretty excited.](https://www.nicotineriver.com/products/flavor-revolution-vanilla-cream)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Vanilla Cream","url":"https://redd.it/7wwjc7","vendor":{"name":"Flavor Revolution","code":"FR"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FR","title":"Vanilla Cream"}},
