Decent throat hit.   \n\n**Flavor Properties**- Nutty, creamy wet sugar, a bit of fruit loops, small hints of chocolate, powdered sugar, and maybe some ginger.\n\n**Relatable Flavors** - The popular Spanish confectionery \"turr√≥n.\"  Amarula liquor from South Africa with less sugar.\n\n**Off Flavors** - Carries a very slight lemony disinfectant scent, but I personally do not taste lemon, just a sharp note that I can somewhat relate to ginger root.\n\n**Position in the recipe** - Most would consider this a supporting flavor at lower percents (0.5-1%), however some people's taste buds might enjoy this as part of a base or a top note (3-4%+)\n      \n**Pairings** - Tobaccos, bakeries, nuts, chocolates, citrus fruits. \n\n**Conclusion** - This flavor has a **lot** of depth.  There are so many layers, and so much going on especially once you reach higher percentages.  While I think it does well in almost any recipe at the right percentage, it is definitely a flavor that could be hated as easily as it is loved. <3","author":"wh1skeyk1ng","title":"Torrone","url":"https://redd.it/4lyh2t","vendor":{"name":"Flavour Art","code":"FA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FA","title":"Torrone"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
