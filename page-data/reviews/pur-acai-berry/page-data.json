A strange musk type smell. I'm assuming that is acai berry?\n\nFlavor Description: I've never tried acai berry, so I'm not sure how it's supposed to taste. Sweet refreshing and complex dark berry, similar to a juicier version of a wild huckleberry to me. Has a hint of a musky smell and taste, very unique to anything I've tried before.\n\nOff Flavors: None\n\nThroat Hit: 2/10\n\nPairings: Almost any fruit, especially other berries. Cookies, cakes, muffins, creams, doughnuts, danish, fruit smoothies or drinks.\n\nNotes: Recommend 6-8% for a single flavor, maybe 2-4% in mixes. I love huckleberries and plan on playing around with this one quite a bit.","author":"mysticrosell","title":"Acai Berry","url":"https://redd.it/6s4rl2","vendor":{"name":"Purilum","code":"PUR"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"PUR","title":"Acai Berry"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
