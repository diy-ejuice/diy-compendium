Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Raspberry @ 3%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 13 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Top heavy, perfumey, but still dense raspberry candy, with a deeper dark berry buried underneath a flat base. I don't get anything fresh or juicy here but the sweetness is nice.\n\n*I seem to be in the minority on this, check the second opinions.*\n\nInhale is all top notes. Lightly sweet, almost bitter. Exhale is dense and seems unbalanced. I get top perfumey notes, and I get some deep berry sweetness, but this seems to missing the middle range that makes a fruit bright and juicy.  Finish has a slight lingering bitterness from all that perfume but otherwise fairly clean for a sticky candy flavor.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  At 3%, this pushes into an almost smarties ([american version, natch](http://www.candywarehouse.com/assets/item/regular/giant-smarties-candy-rolls-125692-im.jpg)) type of chalky candy flavor.  Almost a dry cotton candy feel.  It's a lot less pronounced at lower percentages, but you can feel it lurking right around the corner.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light below 2%, gets weird after that.  Perfume just lodges in the top of my throat with some tightness.\n\n**Uses:** Raspberry top notes with fruit blends.  Part of a full raspberry.  Sweet Raspberry candies.  With the dryness and the perfume thing going on I'd be hard-pressed to figure out much else.\n\n**Pairings:**  Bright, juicy berries. FA Raspberry or INW Raspberry are safe bets.  Maybe a jammy or syrupy dark berry. Blackcurrant to up the tartness a bit.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nS&V concentration tasting, just light perfume for me at .5%.  1% is a bit better, I start  getting an actual raspberry flavor and the sweetness level is dead on.  Still way too perfumey for a full raspberry.  This starts to get weird and muted above 1.5% and that perfume builds up in my throat.  I'd suggest mixing with this as a candy raspberry top note between 1 and 1.5%.\n\nIn context, I don't really see the point. TFA Sweet Raspberry is good for a candy raspberry. FA Raspberry is a good more realisitc take. INW will blow the taste buds out of the back of your head with a sort of artifical but bright as hell raspberry.\n\nShoutout to /u/apexified for sending this my way for review.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nA lot of fleeting mentions on reddit about this being a lot better than I think it is.  A lot of this come downs to percentage, but I just don't get this one.  Some quick mentions [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/3pplaz/favorite_flv_flavors_vs_other_brands/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/54mnoj/the_lab_before_after/), and [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/3dgtzh/has_anyone_received_any_of_flavorahs_new_flavors/).\n\n[/u/skiddlzninja/ thinks this a weak flavor and needs at least 3% in a mix, 6% solo.  Does mention pomegranate and considering that, this does seem a bit more like a pomegranate than a raspberry.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/3kqbcp/to_assist_the_flavorah_recipe_thread_heres_some/)\n\n[At least someone else seems to be on team perfume.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/3s0jec/flv_raspberry_what_percentages_are_you_using_it_at/)\n\n[ELR flavor notes are sparse and not particulary helpful.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/45931)\n\nAnd no reviews on BCF or ECX.  So, as always YMMV.\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Raspberry","url":"https://redd.it/5i56rb","vendor":{"name":"Flavorah","code":"FLV"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FLV","title":"Raspberry"}},
