Milk, white, dark.. no need to pick up all of those when you can get them all right here.  -  - Perfect to add a touch of chocolate to your recipes. Add a few drops to a batch of chocolate chip cookies to bring them to life.  \n\n* **ACCURACY :** &nbsp; &#128308; &#128308; &#128308; &#128308; &#128308; &nbsp; EXACTLY LIKE THE DESCRIPTION  \n\n----------  \n**&#128313; Flavor Description &#128313;**  \nHow to describe Chocolate Overload? \"Overload\" has always some negative connotation of too much for me - in this case, nothing is too much. I get at 10% a flavor full of the broadest chocolate variety. I can taste milk chocolate, then white, then some dark chocolate. Again and again - this is an amazing vaping experience.\nI had a slight hint of dryness with the Chocolate Overload until I remembered that for another GRM one-shot I needed to crank up my regular wattage a 10% to reduce dryness in the vape. It did the trick again and after that, there was no dryness at all.\nAt 10% I got a nice mouthfeel sensation. It's like thin grates of all different kinds of chocolates are melting on your tongue. And the aftertaste makes you long for more. My first tester lasted less than an hour....   \n\n**&#128313; Comments &#128313;**  \nThis is a very dark concentrate and thatâ€™s always something I try to avoid. I know that is subjective, but isn't taste subjective too? This brings the overall grade to a B. Otherwise I see it head to head with the GRM Vanilla Overload.\nThis concentrate is only available directly at Gremberry Farms. Recommended usage for me is 10 % as a one-shot, but I am sure it will mix well at a lower percentage in a mix.","author":"Steve-TC","title":"Chocolate Overload","url":"https://redd.it/rs0d4x","vendor":{"name":"Gremberry Farms Solo's","code":"GRM"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"GRM","title":"Chocolate Overload"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
