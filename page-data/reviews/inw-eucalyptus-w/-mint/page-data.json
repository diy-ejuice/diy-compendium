That's not to say it's not enjoyable when you're not sick, but the cooling effects from the eucalyptus and mint are a god send when you are. Although the flavoring is fairly concentrated, it's not as concentrated as some of the flavorings from INW we've come to know and love. At 1.5%, it's quite alarming right away, but after a steep of a few days - 1 week, it calms down to the perfect level of cooling for me. 0.75%-1% is great for if you need a shake-n-vape. Since it's such a different sensation, it does take a few pulls to acclimate yourself to the cooling, which I've noticed is very forward on the upper-back of the throat. Overall, it's a very accurate representation of Eucalyptus with just a touch of Mint (I get more mint than menthol).\n\n**On the Nose**  \nVery cooling, eucalyptus, slight mint note. Clears out your sinuses.\n\n**Recommended Usage**  \n*Stand alone*: 1.5-2%\n\n*In a mix*: <0.75-1.5%\n\n**Throat**  \nMild; cool.\n\n**Pairings**  \nFruits, florals, mint. \n\n**Avoid**  \nCoffee? IDK.\n\n**Steep**  \n4 days - 1 week for the cooling to calm down to a desireable level. Just bring it down a notch or two if you need something right away\n\n**Quick Recipe: Lemon & Honey Cough Drop**  \n*Ratio: 15PG/85VG*  \n*Steep: 4 days - 1 week* \n\n* INW Eucalyptus w/ Mint @ 1.5%  \n* JF Lemon Juicy @ 3%  \n* FLV Honey Bee @ 1-2 drops per 15ml (0.25%)  \n\nINW Eucalyptus w/ Mint is definitely the star here, offering a wonderful cooling sensation and enjoyable throat & vape. The lemon or other fruits here just offer a nice accent flavor that blends well with eucalyptus w/ mint so your palate doesn't get bored. JF Juicy Lemon is great since it's a fantastic lemon flavor without any unwanted throat from citric acid that other lemons offer.\n\nIf you don't have FLV Honey Bee, you can probably sub FA or TFA in its place, but I personally liked the Honey Bee. I tried it without the Honey and found it not quite as enjoyable. It offers a nice sort of floral sweetness to the mix. Honey also takes a while to steep to be enjoyable, otherwise it will just be too forward and in your face. I liked it at 2 drops in 15ml, but feel free to bring it down to 1 drop so it's not so prominent. I feel a lot of people would probably prefer at 1 drop. \n\n**Quick Recipe: Cherry Cough Drop**  \n*Ratio: 15PG/85VG*  \n*Steep: 4 days - 1 week* \n\n* INW Eucalyptus w/ Mint @ 1.5%  \n* FLV Bing Cherry @ 1.5%  \n\nI really like the FLV Bing cherry here too. It's got a sort of \"Luden's\" cherry taste to it which pairs very well in a cough drop. Feel free to try subbing your favorite cherries, berries, other fruits, etc with Eucalyptus w/ Mint to create your perfect Cough Drop","author":"CheebaSteeba","title":"Eucalyptus w/ Mint","url":"https://redd.it/4qyjq4","vendor":{"name":"Inawera","code":"INW"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"INW","title":"Eucalyptus w/ Mint"}},
