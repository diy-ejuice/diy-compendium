Dry, but not too dry, a bit chalky, with some moisture on the exhale. I think this nails the gumball flavor, but I would use closer to 2.5%. \n\nOff Flavors: none\n\nThroat Hit: none\n\nUses and pairings: I'm not convinced that this by itself is a complete bubblegum flavor, as i think it needs more of a double bubble chalky but juicy flavor. I would pair this with other bubblegums (I use it with Bubblegum YC) and fruits. Maybe add a cream in to smooth it out but I don't think that's necessary, it's just the only other thing i could think to do.\n\nSecond Opinions: none that i could find on here.\n\n","author":"[deleted]","title":"Donald Bubblegum","url":"https://redd.it/6mi6cy","vendor":{"name":"Inawera","code":"INW"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"INW","title":"Donald Bubblegum"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
