    "result": {"data":{"reviewsJson":{"markdown":"**Percentage Used:** 4%\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Equipment Used:**  Troll RDA with a single Kanthal .3 ohm Staircase coil at 27W. 24g kernel with 32g wrap, cotton wick.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**PG/VG:** 30/70\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Steep Time:** 4 Days and 4 Weeks\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Aroma:** Sweetness, sour cheese/BA, mixed artificial fruit. Apple Jacks.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Flavor Description:** This is the same as the fruit loops with added curdled milk. Fruit and cereal flavor on this one is very weak and buried under the sour milk. Faint oat/grain cereal, sweetened mixed fruit. Apple seems dominant to me, with a hint of lemon? Tastes like apple jacks rather than fruit loops. The fruit is artificial, nothing fresh. \n\nAt 4 weeks the curdled milk is gone completely. It has moved to the back and become more of a cream/milk, while the cereal is up front. Weirdly, this comes closer to fruit loops than their actual fruit loops. Like the fruit loops, that Cheerios oat flavor is gone and has moved into a nice grain cereal. An artificially flavored sweetened cereal. I still get a subtle apple jacks flavor, but this does come closer to an authentic fruit loops. The lemon is slightly more noticeable, without being overwhelming or acidic. I am getting hints of the pink and purple circles now, and the milk gives it a nice creamy moistness that also steers it closer to the flavored milk left in the bottom of the bowl category.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:** Curdled milk at first, steeped out.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit:**3/10\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Pairings:** Milks or creams. Butter and marshmallow for a cereal bar.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Notes:** This is a mild to medium flavor compared to the same percentage of their fruit loops without milk. The cream component mutes the fruitiness just slightly. It's not a bad thing, but I do think the flavor would be better around 6-9% as a single flavor. This is actually quite good.\n","author":"mysticrosell","title":"Fruit Circles with Milk","url":"https://redd.it/62rg8j","vendor":{"name":"Purilum","code":"PUR"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"PUR","title":"Fruit Circles with Milk"}},
