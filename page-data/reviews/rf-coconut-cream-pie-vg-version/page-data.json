If anyone knows anything I should do differently feel free to let me know. I promise I won't cry ;) Maybe...lol\n\n&nbsp;\n\nPlease understand these are just my opinions, and I have only been mixing for about 8 months. I hope it helps. These flavors really do need at least a 4 week steep to fully develop the flavors. VG just doesn't carry the flavor like PG. However, even using higher percentages, if they are single flavors it's not using any more flavoring than they usual 15-20% of combines flavors that is commonly used with a lot of flavoring. These are not super concentrated like INW or FA.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Coconut Cream Pie**\n\n- Tested 10% @ 1 week steep. This is a delicious, sweet, creamy, strong and authentic flavored coconut cream pie. Even at only 1 week steep, it's very well balanced to me. Great ratio of crust to creamy coconut filling, topped with thick layers of real whipped cream. I can easily see this as a stand alone ADV. Can't wait to taste this at 4 weeks, I really like this one. I can see it being changed very easily as well depending on what you are in the mood for. An extra touch of sweetened coconut, or pie crust. Or even a touch of graham cracker to change it to a graham crust. Maybe even pineapple for pineapple coconut pie? Or Pina Colada. Mmmmmm, so good!\n- At a 4 week steep. I'm even more in love with this. It will definitely be one of my ADVs. Still very well balanced, slightly sweeter, even more thick mouth feel. It has gotten more creamy and much deeper flavor. This might be my favorite. Maybe.\n\n**UPDATE:** I recommend only making enough to last up to 6 weeks at a time as I have found the flavor tends to fade quite a bit after that. Also bumping it up to 15-20% helps a little.
