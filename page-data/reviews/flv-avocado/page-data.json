Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Flavorah Avocado, .25%, 1% and 3%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 14 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Underripe, slightly fruity avocado with a thicker base.\n\nThe avocado here is actually fairly prominent, especially at higher percentages.  It feels a bit artificially bright, and comes across as underripe.  A bit fruitier than a deeper, heavier ripe avocado flavor.   Light hints of something like a green banana, again like an underripe avocado.   I’d also peg it as something like green banana sweetness, not overwhelming, and almost a bit starchy as opposed to a fuller fruit or candy sweetness.  Nothing too earthy or funky here but a very light nuttiness. Most of that avocado is in working in the top notes, almost like a floral would.  The top notes specifically can get a bit dry, which is odd against the thicker base.\n\nRelatively thick, smooth body to this. Creamy without any discernible dairy notes.  Base tastes fairly neutral overall, although it does have just a bit of buttery fattiness.   The bulk of the actual avocado flavor mostly seems to sit on top of that heavier base.  Doesn’t quite cohere and really bleed into the thickness here. Tastes like an avocado top note on top of a thicker base, as opposed to a creamy avocado.  The inhale feels fairly cohesive, but the exhale has that avocado separating out and leaving the middle of the flavor feeling a bit light.  I wouldn’t think it would be a major issue in a mix where there are other flavors but it’s a bit odd solo.\n\nBelieve it or not, I haven’t had a ton of avocado flavors.  I feel like FE Avocado has a good deal of dulche de leche style caramel to it and just a tiny bit of vague green weirdness.  Sort of like an RY4 effect, but with green instead of tobacco.  I need to do a lot more testing with it, but from some very preliminary messing around,  Vape Train avocado seems to have a pretty prominent banana note which makes the whole experience kind of confusing.    This tastes a lot closer to an actual avocado to me without most of that banana or caramel baggage.  \n\n**Off-Flavors:**  Underripe and a bit fruity, but pretty low key.  Nothing too vegetal, funky, or swampy here.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light.  Fairly smooth but the top notes of the flavor can get a bit throaty.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At .25%, this feels a bit dry to me.  I’m getting a light avocado but that thicker base isn’t really coming through for me.  Avocado seems kind of one note here.\n\nAt 1%, this feels a bit more solid.  Avocado is maybe a bright, but the base seems fuller overall.  Doesn’t quite taste rich to me so much as kind of heavy. \n\nAt 3%, that avocado is getting pretty bright and maybe picking up some of that fruitier banana. Base seems richer though, and I’m actually getting a bit of fat to it.  I mean, for 3% of a FLV Avocado flavor, the lack of grievous off-notes is pretty cool.\n\nJust based on these tests, this has a relatively wide workable range.  I mean, you could go safe and use this around .5% for an avocado accent in something… but that seems safe.  I’d probably be mixing closer to 2%.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Uhhhhhhh…… maybe throw it an ice cream?   Some additional cream and richness is going to smooth out that top note a bit more and should be be pretty good?  Just use TPA VBIC and you could have a black pepper and avocado ice cream, which is a thing exists.  If you wanted to really blow out the heavier parts of the base, add some FLV Coconut.\n\nWith said, that I think the green part of this isn’t going to magically disappear in mixes, and will still stick out so it might not be some silver bullet for adding thickness if you don’t want the mix to kind of taste like avocado… but I’ve had run-ins with vegan avocado frosting so you may not have my own personal scars related to tasting avocado where it shouldn’t be. \n\nNot crazy savory, but I can’t think of a fruit that would really pair well except for lime but I really like guacamole.  \n\nOr hey, when it doubt, claim it could be used in a tobacco.  Would probably work well to add some thickness to a tobacco without making the entire thing seem wet and would play well with the savory notes there.  \n\n**Second Opinions:**  [There is an ELR Page up for this.  Rin writes: “tastes the way avocado smells... hard to describe... not a very in your face flavor but has a unique mouth-feel... a lot of body. would probably be great to add to creams/ etc to add that texture/extra body. Will report back after I've tried that. \nPreferred single flavor mix: 0.5%”](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/234674)\n\n[User “gatchay” has an Avacado Coconut Ice Cream recipe up on ATF.  From their notes: “FLV avocado isn't exactly a realistic avocado, but they did a very good job capturing that fatty thickness you get from an avocado. The reality is an avocado isn't packed with a ton of flavor to begin with. You get more of the actual taste as it lingers rather than when you vape it, but none the less this is the closest to avocado out of the others I've tried. This flavoring is actually fairly strong and can be used lower depending what you're doing, I liked it most in this at 0.75% to stand up to the creams. It needed to separate itself rather than just thicken things up, which you can also use this for lower at around 0.25%. “](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/92823#avocado_coconut_ice_cream_by_gachatay)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Avocado","url":"https://redd.it/87qx0m","vendor":{"name":"Flavorah","code":"FLV"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FLV","title":"Avocado"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
