At 6% the roasted peanut is coming through much harder as borderline burnt and over-bearing, with not much peanut butter taste.  It coats my mouth/throat, causing the flavor to linger quite a bit longer than most others.\n\n**Off-flavors:** The nuts taste overly toasted at higher percentages and kind of take over the peanut butter.  If you use too much of this flavor, after a month or two steep, it develops an aroma of smashed beetles when you vape it.\n\n**Throat hit:** 2/10 Pretty smooth\n\n**Uses:** A pleasant and unique nutty light peanut butter accent under 1.5%, doesn't seem to carry a whole lot of peanut butter \"feel\" until you get above 2%.  I'd max this out around 4 or 5 % unless the inherent over-roasted peanut taste doesn't bother you.\n\n**Pairings:**  A cream or two for starters if you're chasing a more \"Skippy-esque\" peanut butter.  Nuts, tobaccos, custards and bakeries.  Fruits might be tricky with this flavor after a steep, but berries and fleshy fruits are great pairings with this as a shake n vape.  Citrus with this one is interesting and offers a fairly sharp contrast in flavor, but again it gets lost after a week or ten days steep.\n\n**Notes:** I was really hoping for a creamier peanut butter as sort of a \"be all end all\" over at /r/GooberGrapeVape.  This isn't really a bad peanut butter flavoring IMO, it just isn't what I was hoping for, and still has its uses.\n\nFlavor available at BCF [here](http://www.bullcityflavors.com/peanut-butter-hs/) \n\n[Link to e-liquid-recipes notes on this flavor](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/21716)\n\n[Link to all of our flavor reviews in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)\n\nEDIT: off flavors","author":"wh1skeyk1ng","title":"Peanut Butter","url":"https://redd.it/5qpiwz","vendor":{"name":"Hangsen","code":"HS"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"HS","title":"Peanut Butter"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
