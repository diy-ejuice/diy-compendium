It smells like peanut butter, the absolute essence of peanuts, but I must admit that it's REALLY freaking concentrated, and I'm getting some chemical off notes there. But.. generally peanuts it is. Just it. This kind-of earthy, peanut smell.\n\n\n**The inhale.**\n\nThe throat hit is mild, and as for the flavor when inhaling, for me there's this taste similar to an aftertaste when swallowing peanuts. Sounds funny maybe, but yeah, that is it for me.\n\n**The exhale.**\n\nThroat hit is there, but not overly hard. This flavor is so rich, I mean, it represents peanuts so well that I really don't have much to add there. But it lacks some complexity to it.. on the other hand, peanuts is peanuts, right? What should I expect?\nThe flavor really reminds me of peanut butter.\nIn higher concentrations I'm getting really nasty chemical off-notes though, real unpleasant. This stuff is so efficient that 2% is actually a lil bit too much for me. Beyond this point, it starts to taste bitter and full on artificial. Kinda like burned plastic.\n\n**Uses and pairings:** I've tried to combine it with banana flavor and a lil bit of cheesecake, works well for me. Maybe could be good with a jelly flavor? Definetly would recommend mixing it with tobacco and creamy/dessert mixes. Solo it's just peanuts.\n\n**Personal testing notes**: 1-2% is fine. Tastes slightly milder when steeping for a few days. DO NOT GO BEYOND 2%, you will become a peanut and die a painful death.\n\n**Second opinions:** One friend says it's great, \"zajebiste orzeszki\" which means \"freaking good peanuts\" and vapes it all day, the other one.. well, not so much.\n\n\n**Summary:** Really efficient and balanced flavor, represents the real deal quite well, but one has to be careful with percentage, because adding too much will pretty much destroy the mix and turn your set into mobile meth lab when it comes to smell. I couldn't stand it when I added to much.\n\n\nquestions/co-op/review propositions: mrgvape@gmail.com\n\nZni≈ºki na idym.eu/idym.eu discounts: enter YWJJ7KN5 code during checkout","author":"mrgruszka","title":"Zwei Peanuts","url":"https://redd.it/75vpfd","vendor":{"name":"Inawera","code":"INW"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"INW","title":"Zwei Peanuts"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
