Virginia Tobacco is really only something I would use as a support tobacco.\n- I would be more likely to reach for INW Virginia Tobacco Absolute before I reach for this one.","author":"T_Mace","title":"Virginia Tobacco","url":"https://redd.it/5pczo8","vendor":{"name":"Flavorah","code":"FLV"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FLV","title":"Virginia Tobacco"}},
