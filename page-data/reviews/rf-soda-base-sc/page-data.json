(.5 ohms) 35 Watts. Airflow restricted.\n\n**Testing:** Real flavors Soda Base (SC) @ .5%-1%. 80/20 VG/PG Liquid Barn Premix.\n\n**Flavor Notes**\n\nThis is my introduction into the Real Flavors lineup so it is fitting that I start with something obscure like Soda Base. In truth I picked this up to investigate its' use in a slush recipe following some of the observations made by Concrete River as a possible ingredient to use in the base flavor.\n\nOn the nose I am getting a effervescent and medium bodied soda/candy aroma. Perhaps the effervescent part is \"power of suggestion\" but it does remind me of putting your nose up to a bottle of ginger ale slightly. It has the same quality that I find with FW Pink Champagne, which falls well short of carbonation but it does suggest it. The actual smell is a little non-descript on the nose somewhere between a lemon-lime soda and cotton candy maybe.\n\nI believe the suggested range for these flavors are 1-2.5% so I started at 1%. It has a medium body with a well defined sweetness on the inhale and a pleasant candy-like bordering on syrup exhale. Not syrupy like Cactus but perhaps the syrup level you get in a soda. Soda base is carbonic acid and corn syrup if I'm not mistaken so this fits pretty well. I wouldn't say it is quite that neutral perhaps more in line with some of the candy texturizes out there. Nothing too distracting and I can't pinpoint it but it does have a flavor to it that I would best described as candy-like. Not bad at all. If I had to guess I would say there is a fair amount of sweetener in here-pretty high but not overload. I'm sensing that even at 1% this is too strong to act as a component in a slush mix so I added some base to my bottle and diluted it by half bringing the concentration down to around .5%.\n\nAt .5% this is hitting the sweet spot. It is still round and present but a little more focused. It still retains a medium body to it which is impressive but again due to its nature it is hard to make sweeping declarations about its merits until it finds its way into a mix and serves its intended purpose. While pleasant by itself I don't think it would make a complete vape unless your just weird. It is really hard to describe the actual flavor but all these come to mind: syrup, dragon fruit, lemon-lime, sweet tart....the body is good but the top notes aren't super glaring which again as I think about-sets this up nice for a base. It is mild syrupy but not wet like cactus. \n\n**Off Notes** Really nothing to speak of...stays in its lane.\n\n**Throat Hit** At 1% I was getting a little harshness but I went into this with a dry scratchy throat so I'm not confident in that being a property of the concentrate. \n\n**Uses/Pairings**  I picked this up specifically as a base for furthering my slush obsessions but it seems like it could work pretty well as a plug in play with various fruit flavors to make those old fashioned soda shop types. I also think it could work in conjunction with or as a candy base when your looking for something new to get some body in a candy recipe. It suggests a mild effervescence but not too a point that it couldn't be used for other things. I would keep it around .5% or lower in a dense recipe up to 1% if you want to really push on it. \n\n**Parting Thoughts** Overall I was pretty impressed with this one. Perhaps I will post some sort of follow up as I put it through its paces in some recipes but for me anyway, it passes the single flavor test. You know your either imagining all the recipes you wan't to try it in or your eyeballing the trashcan...this one is the former.
