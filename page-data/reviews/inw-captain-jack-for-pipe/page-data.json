Aromatic tobaccos have what's called \"toppings\" such as cherry, vanilla, citrus, etc.\n- Use this accordingly to make a medium bodied pipe blend.\n- Not much more to say, if this was a main note in a mix, I would enjoy puffing it for a few hours a day but it's not an adv ingredient for me. However, mixed at very low % in a leafy blend, this could add a bit of character and give some interesting personality to the recipe. I'll definitely be toying with this one.","author":"T_Mace","title":"Captain Jack for Pipe","url":"https://redd.it/5qpp9f","vendor":{"name":"Inawera","code":"INW"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"INW","title":"Captain Jack for Pipe"}},
