But smooth for the most part. \n\n**Flavor Properties**- Slight creaminess, fruit and cake\n\n**Relatable Flavors** - I taste a very artificial strawberry followed by what appears to be FW Yellow cake and some kind of cream.\n\n**Off Flavors** - I wouldn't call it off but the strawberry is very artificial. Aside from that, there is some odd waxiness to it, similar to the properties I taste in FW Yogurt. Not sure if it's just a subjective thing but nothing noticeable enough to turn you off.\n\n**Position In The Recipe** - Without a doubt, this was made to be a standalone or a base note. Personally, I wouldn't recommend this as a standalone as it doesn't have the complexity or the nuances to make it a tasty enough vape.\n\n**Pairings** - It needs another strawberry or two to bring out it's strawberry notes. It also needs a lot more cream and cake to make it feel like a real strawberry shortcake.\n\n**End notes** - This is an average flavor. It could become great with the right note pairings, or you could just scratch it and build your own strawberry shortcake!
