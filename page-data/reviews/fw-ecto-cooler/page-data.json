After looking at reviews and such I decided 10% to be a good starting point for this flavor. \n\nMixed @ 10%, steeped 2-3days & tested on derringer clone w/ dual .32ohm coils @ 45w\n\nDecent amount of flavor. First thing that comes to mind is rind but also sweet.. Naval orange seems to be the flavor this is trying to mimic. But its like taking a bite of a naval orange, unpeeled without getting that cottonmouth feeling.. Which Imo isn't that bad. I enjoy it. \n\nGoing to drop it down to 8% see if the rind-y-ness goes away. \n\nRegardless tho this is a decent stand alone and would be great in citrus mixes and beverages as well. Most likely ordering more of this stuff to mess around with.","author":"Twistedfexer","title":"Ecto Cooler","url":"https://redd.it/4d4lar","vendor":{"name":"Flavor West","code":"FW"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FW","title":"Ecto Cooler"}},
