A good thick mouthfeel would give it a 6 out of 10. Moderate throat hit I would say 5 out of 10.                \n             \n**Flavor Properties**-  Predominantly Ginger flavoring with hints of citrus. (lemon, lime, orange)Bitter, Sweet, and Tart all at the same time. Innowera has a flavor description up saying it includes cinnamon and anise, I'm getting the sense of anise, I don't really taste the cinnamon at all. \n\n**Relatable Flavors** - Reminds me of lemonade with ginger and an orange twist. ( now all I need is some vodka )\n\n**Off Flavors** - Lingering aftertaste I don't know if I really say it's an off flavor I'm kind of enjoying it.\n\n**Position In The Recipe** - Really has a lot of punch going to make an excellent accent, or top note.\n\n**Pairings** - Going to pair well with almost all fruits providing contrast and enhancing the sweetness. Floral notes are going to pair well such as shisha Rosemary, and dessert flavors such as ice cream or custard may surprise you. Can't believe I'm saying this but I'm going to try it with FLV lemongrass to try and make my favorite creme brulee. (lemon ginger)\n\n*Please if your opinion differs, or you have another review for this post it in the comments.
