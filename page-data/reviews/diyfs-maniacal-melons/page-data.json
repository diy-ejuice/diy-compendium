Very perfumey throughout and not very strong so if you use more itâ€™ll get worse. Does not get much better with a steep (going on 25 days). Even w/o the floral part this is not super tasty.\n\n**Off-flavors**: Perfume/Floral bits that really distract.\n\n**Throat Hit**: kind of harsh but goes away after a few days\n\n**Uses**: maybe if you could cover up the perfume part it could be paired with fruits and candies but imo its not worth this there are better starting points for this flavor profile (FA fuji, LA watermelon, TPA watermelon)\n\n**Pairings**: no one will buy this so there are no pairings\nNotes sorry this is brief it is just one of the worst concentrates I own.\n\n**Second Opinions**\nNothing much out there, a handful of private recipes use this on ELR and it is not listed on ATF.","author":"HashSlingingSlashur","title":"Maniacal Melons","url":"https://redd.it/5rxbd6","vendor":{"name":"DIY Flavor Shack","code":"DIYFS"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"DIYFS","title":"Maniacal Melons"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
