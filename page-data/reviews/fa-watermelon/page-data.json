Almost no rind at all. Flavor is definitely on the lighter side. Kicked it up to 4% concentration. Still just coming through as a faint sweet watermelon flesh. No candy-like flavor at all with just a small amount of rind. Said \"fuck it\" and cranked it up to 6%. This flavor (at least to me) is super weak, faint. I get almost no flavor except the whisper of ripe watermelon flesh. Maybe I have a \"no watermelon for you\" gene?\n\n**Off-flavors:**  None unless you are counting it's lack of strength as an off-flavor.\n\n**Throat Hit:** None \n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I am thinking this would pair with the usual suspects like cactus and kiwi; however, I'm afraid it might get buried quick if not mixed carefully.\n\n\n**Notes:**\n\nIt seems FA changed the name or sells both watermelon and red summer depending on where you are located. Kudos for the confusion, FA!\n\nFrom what I've read most people find this to be a more realistic watermelon than other offerings with a bit of a drying throat hit. I get no throat hit and almost no watermelon flavor so YMMV.\n\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n[A good discussion of the various watermelon flavors including FA Watermelon.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/4oekv3/flavor_of_the_week_watermelon_revisited/)\n\n[Hilariously named recipe from that previous thread \"Strap On\".\n](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/6487#strap_on_by_id10_t)\n\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**\n\nEdit: I don't know whether I should be proud or ashamed that I am the first \"NSFW\" flavor review...","author":"vape_account","title":"Watermelon","url":"https://redd.it/5shsy2","vendor":{"name":"Flavour Art","code":"FA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FA","title":"Watermelon"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
