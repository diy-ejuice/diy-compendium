    "result": {"data":{"reviewsJson":{"markdown":"**Percentage Used:** 6%\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Equipment Used:**  Troll RDA with a single Kanthal .3 ohm Staircase coil at 27W. 24g kernel with 32g wrap, cotton wick.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**PG/VG:** 30/70\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Steep Time:** 9 Days\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Aroma:** Caramel, brown sugar, butter, nuts.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Flavor Description:** Sweet and rich brown sugar caramel or toffee is right up front. It's not like caramel candy, definitely more brittle hard candy. Pretty equally balanced with the candy is toasted nuts, not raw, I think peanuts but I'm not positive. Maybe a nut mix. Back notes of butter a darker vanilla, similar to bourbon vanilla.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:** None\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit:** 3/10\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Pairings:** Cookies, cakes, creams, custards, nuts, tobaccos, danishes, coconut, doughnuts, chocolate, coffee.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Notes:** Moderate strength at 6%. I'm thinking for a full flavored brittle I'll push it to 7-9% for single flavor. Probably 1.5-4% in mixes.It's a well layered complete flavor. This is making me want a vanilla cupcake with mocha frosting sprinkled with vanilla nut brittle. Yummy.","author":"mysticrosell","title":"Vanilla Nut Brittle","url":"https://redd.it/6s4r5j","vendor":{"name":"Purilum","code":"PUR"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"PUR","title":"Vanilla Nut Brittle"}},
