    "result": {"data":{"reviewsJson":{"markdown":"**Setup:** Plume Veil RDA; dual parallel @ .40Î©; cotton wicks; 50W\n\n**Testing:** TFA English Toffee @ 3%; Aged: 19 days\n\n**Flavor description:**  Raw and sort of bitter toffee with a faint note of what reminds me of molasses, but nothing overly sweet to back up the bitterness.  Has a slight nuttiness to it as well.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Cheese, dirty cardboard, sweaty socks, however you name it, this flavor has it.  Also carries an offensive stench when you vape it around sensitive nostrils.\n\n**Throat hit:** 8/10\n\n**Uses:**  Part of a base in confectioneries (such as the obvious toffee), or a supporting note in certain candy bar recipes.\n\n**Pairings:**  Caramel, brown sugar, chocolate, nuts, and some thicker creams, but not just any lil' cream will do.  \n\n**Notes:**   Definitely a great example of how subjective flavors can be.  Most people that try it will not like it no matter what it's in, but I think a true love for toffee is a must if you plan on enjoying this flavor.  This is one that the future wife does not allow me to vape in the house when she's home because of the stench.  I can't say I blame her.\n\n**BONUS RECIPE:**\n\nI don't typically include a recipe with my reviews, but I thought I would share my 6th attempt in making an enjoyable toffee recipe.  This flavor had me frustrated for a long time, but I'm finally decently satisfied with most of this mix:\n\nIngredient | %\n----------|-\nTFA English Toffee | 5\nTFA Brown Sugar | 2\nFW Butter Pecan | 2.5\nTFA Cheesecake Graham Crust | 2\nFA Almond | 1\nTFA Acetyl Pyrazine | 0.5\nTFA Sweetener | 1\n\nTotal Flavor 14%\n\nI have to say that the FW Butter Pecan probably helped develop the sweetness the most.  Brown Sugar and CGC also played a great supporting role.  I had the Sweetener up to 3% without Butter Pecan, and it just wasn't working for me.  I think my next go I might dumb it down... bump the Butter Pecan to 3%, omit the last 3 and use something like FA Joy or FA Custard at 1-2% instead.  Thanks for reading!\n\nEDIT: [Link to all of our flavor reviews in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)","author":"wh1skeyk1ng","title":"English Toffee","url":"https://redd.it/4svxnp","vendor":{"name":"The Flavor Apprentice","code":"TFA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"TFA","title":"English Toffee"}},
