Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** CAP Cool Mint @ 4%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 13 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Mentholated vanilla on the inhale. Moderately dense. Sweetness builds through inhale into exhale. Lightly mentholated exhale, with a peppermint candy flavor. Artificial sweetener notes show up halfway through the exhale and linger after the finish. \n\nSort of generic mint flavor with almost no sharp edges.  Creamy non-dairy light vanilla volume to it. Close to, but not quite, a peppermint, but definitely not a spearmint. No realistic mint herb notes or chemical harshness.  Moderately to lightly mentholated.   Sweet, but that sweetness tastes a bit artificial.  That sucralose note is going to be covered up pretty quickly, especially in sweeter recipes.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Aggressive sweetness.  Lingering aspartame/sucralose slightly bitter note on the exhale.\n\n**Throat Hit:** 0/10.  Flavor is extremely smooth.\n\n**Uses:**  Mint candies and ice creams. Lots of use in shamrock shakes Alternative for Koolada in brighter fruit mixes where the sucralose taste isn't going to stick out.\n  \n**Pairings:** Milk chocolates, Vanilla, Your VBIC of choice, Watermelon, Strawberry. Creams, thick or light.\n\n**Notes:**  Good mint to use with creams and chocolates if you want to replicate a bland commercial-type mint.  Really smooth, linear strength up to around 10%.  Creamy vanilla notes will blend well in these applications.  The Creme de Menthe's (FLV and FW) are pretty highly regarded with these kind of flavor profiles, so I'd definitely take a look at those first.  \n\nThose sucralose-ish notes mess with top notes on most fruit and seem to make dark fruits a bit weird. I'd keep it to brighter non-perfumey fruits and take it pretty easy there. Probably under 1% for just a hint of cooling menthol.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[ELR Flavor Page, single percentages are again the work of crazy people, but sweetness and workable strength are mentioned.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/1946)\n\n[Pretty solid reviews on ECX. Difficult to mix with, but pleasant by itself.  Someone says \"White Tic Tac\"](http://www.ecigexpress.com/shop/diy-e-liquid/diy-e-liquid-flavors/capella-flavor-drops/capella-fruit-flavors/cool-mint-by-capella.html)\n\n[Vurve's watermelon crack clone. Probably your best fruit application of this flavor](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/7025#watermelon_crack_bx_vapor_clone_by_vurve)\n\nShoutout to Lynn on ECX all the way back in 2012.  This is a white tic tac. Fake sugar notes and all. Spot on.\n\n**Bonus:** [This concentrate, solo, is Adam Bomb's Chillaxin.  2013 me would have been extremely grateful to know this.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/4vyepm/anyone_only_enjoy_menthol_vapes/d62j8sl/)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Cool Mint","url":"https://redd.it/5dz19n","vendor":{"name":"Capella","code":"CAP"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"CAP","title":"Cool Mint"}},
