However, it is a very realistic fresh strawberry. No hints of artificial notes or candied strawberries. \n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:** None\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit:** 2/10\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Pairings:** Most any fruit except citrus.Especially bananas, kiwis, peaches, melons. Cookies, cakes, cereal, creams, custards, shortcake, biscuits. Shakes, milk, whipped cream.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Notes:** Moderate strength at this percentage, I think this would be good layered with other strawberries in blends at 4-7%. Not complex enough for a SF for my tastes.\n","author":"mysticrosell","title":"Strawberry Ripe","url":"https://redd.it/5mx7kt","vendor":{"name":"Purilum","code":"PUR"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"PUR","title":"Strawberry Ripe"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
