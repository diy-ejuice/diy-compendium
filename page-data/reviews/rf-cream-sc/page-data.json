Flavor is slightly sweet, not overwhelming or heavy. A basic cream, this has a little bit of a thick creamy mouth feel. I was hoping for a whipped cream flavor, hoping this develops into one with either a longer steep or higher percentage. Or both.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo far a light flavor, but waiting for a tradition steep time for creams before final decision. Based on the first taste test, I'm thinking this will be better at a 1.5-2% range. I will retest at 4 week and decide then.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nEDIT: 4 week steep. This hasn't changed much, still a light sweet cream. No hints of buttermilk/cheese. Pure clean cream, just slightly sweet. TBH, I'm thinking the sweetness is just the natural sweetness of the VG as it doesn't seem any sweeter than vaping plain VG. Very small amount of a thick mouth feel at this percentage, I think this will increase with higher percentage. I think this would be best in the 1.5-3% range in a mix depending on how dominant you want the cream. I don't see myself using this as a SF.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis didn't change much if at all with a longer steep, so huge reduction in waiting time :)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nEDIT: Real Flavors has announced they will be changing the names of their Raw Extracts to Super Concentrates.","author":"mysticrosell","title":"Cream SC","url":"https://redd.it/55shxk","vendor":{"name":"Real Flavors","code":"RF"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"RF","title":"Cream SC"}},
