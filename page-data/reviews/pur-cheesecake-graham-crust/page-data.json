Graham cracker crust is very dominant and good strength, and it tastes like the crackers moistened with a creamy butteriness. I'm not getting a lot of cheesecake itself, but it's the best graham crust I've tried, with the sweet buttery moistness that has been missing in other brands. I am also getting notes of creamy coconut very similar to Purilum's NY Cheesecake during the first 2 weeks. This is going to be a very popular flavor for me. Some people may find the coconut is too prominent, especially if they don't like it, or it doesn't work for the intended flavor profile during the first week or two. It's less noticeable at lower percentages and does steep out, it's the intensity of the graham cracker until it mellows. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:** Coconut\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit:** 3/10 Gets better with steeping.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Pairings:** Desserts, bakeries, cookies, cereals, custards, anywhere you want body. Vanilla, cheesecake, fruits except citrus, cookie, pies, crust, butter, any creams, custard, condensed milk, cakes.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Notes:** Very good strength at 7% for SF and 1.5-4% in blends. Compared to CAP Cheesecake Graham, this is much more authentic.  Not as creamy as Caps,  but it actually tastes like a real buttery graham crust itself.\n","author":"mysticrosell","title":"Cheesecake Graham Crust","url":"https://redd.it/5mws0v","vendor":{"name":"Purilum","code":"PUR"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"PUR","title":"Cheesecake Graham Crust"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
