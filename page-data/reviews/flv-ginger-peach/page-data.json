Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FLV Ginger Peach @ 1% and 1 drop per 10 ml (about .25%), 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 15 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Sweet cream soda body with some subtle peach and a bit of spicier ginger on the backend. The peach here is crazy soft, more of a sweet background than a primary flavor. Ginger is relatively subtle, but you get it pretty clearly on the back end. The body is super interesting, it's sweet and full, but really soft and I'd swear I'm getting a bit of vanilla toward the backend with the ginger. Softer flavor overall, I'd use primarily for beverage vapes and maybe a sweetener for fruit mixes. Pretty concentrated, use low and work up.\n\nInhale has a bit of sharp ginger in the top notes and a warm, heavily sweet base with just a bit of light, soft peach flavor with no real floral component.  Kind of like a white peach, where it's lacking the really heavy identifiable peach flavor, and instead is a peach tinged sweetness. Moderately dense, and that sweetness tastes realistic, without any kind of chemical edge. Exhale is soft, warm, and dense. Almost has an herbal tea kind of quality, where there's a definite volume, but no real sharper artificial peach taste.  Some light, spicy ginger in the top notes, but it's really subtle until you hit the tail of the exhale and it starts to build a bit. Same kind of heavily sweet sort of peachy base to the exhale.  No real clear taste of vanilla, but It really reminds me of the really soft, sweet vanilla that you get a cream soda with the same kind of sugary, dense mouthfeel. \n\n**Off-flavors:**  So nothing offensive here, but it's a bit weird overall. I don't get a super clear peach, and there is a cream soda type of sweet body to it.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Not really, which is pretty cool for both peach and ginger.  Both of those can get a bit harsh, but I get no real throat hit out of this. Some spice from the ginger in there, but nothing like a normal throat hit.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This is a pretty mellow flavor, but like most of the flavorah it should sit pretty front and center in a mix. I'd use this as a primary note, and build around it.\n\nI'm pretty instantly thinking about a bubble tea / boba kind of mix. I think the softer peach, and that cream soda body is going to mix really well with some lighter milk/cream flavors and maybe some of that FE Green Tea.\n\nAlso seems like a good candidate for other beverage mixes, like lemonades and black teas.\n\nShould also work with florals, which are finally kind of a thing again.\n\nThis is a bit warm and wet for pairing with heavier creams and custards or bakeries, I'd probably avoid it.\n\nThis has a good natural-tasting sweetness, this may have some use as a sweetener with a dense mouthfeel in fruit mixes. The ginger isn't overbearing at all, and should work really well with other peaches, plums, apples, and pears.\n  \n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, this is really interesting.  It's a soft flavor overall, but it definitely isn't weak.  I get the full flavor of the concentrate at .25%.  It's actually a bit dryer down low, and that cream soda edge has almost a marshmallow dryness to it. The ginger also stands out quite a bit down here. Still light on the peach flavor, but it's present.  .5% is mostly sweeter, wetter, and denser. It seems to be muting itself just a bit, but the mouthfeel and sweetness is definitely ramping up. 1% is even denser and sweeter, with a softer ginger flavor but more of that cream soda body.  1.5% is starting to get a bit too moist for me, and I'm losing some of the nuance of the flavor. Definitely sweet though. 2% is mostly warm sweetness.  I'd start low at around .25-.5% and work up until you get the mouthfeel you're after.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nNot a one, seriously.\n\n[Not even a description on the flavorah product page.](http://store.flavorah.com/concentrated-ginger-peach-flavor)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Ginger Peach","url":"https://redd.it/69p4qq","vendor":{"name":"Flavorah","code":"FLV"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FLV","title":"Ginger Peach"}},
