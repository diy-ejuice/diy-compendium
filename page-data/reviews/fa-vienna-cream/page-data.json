( I'm sure someone will tell me it tastes like cardboard. I didn't realize how much cardboard people ate until I started posting flavor reviews. )\n\n**Position In The Recipe** - I have seen this used in countless recipes and I've always considered it a bass note.but After tasting it solo I'm convinced it's simply an accent for other richer creams. \n\n**Pairings** - Other creams, fruits, berries, tobacco's, bakeries,  and nut flavorings.( please let me know if I missed any )","author":"Chrisdvr1","title":"Vienna Cream","url":"https://redd.it/4ni9tj","vendor":{"name":"Flavour Art","code":"FA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FA","title":"Vienna Cream"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
