Tastes like the Rose doughnut filling. Dosage 8-10 drops in 10ml e-liquid\"\n \n**Conclusion:** Freshly mixed I just got a real strong rose note. After it steeped for 4 weeks the rose is still there but it has calmed down. It is more of sweet rose water note. Also getting some tangy like sourness at the end of exhale. I believe that is supposed to be the tobacco. A lot of the INW tobaccos i have tested I get a slight tanginess but there is also some grassiness that goes along with it which is not there with this flavor, but it can be easily added with some INW Virginia Absolute. This flavor is also on the dryer side like a lot of the INW tobaccos. I noticed after 3-4 hits my tongue would be really dry. I have never had a rose filled doughnut so I can not say if this taste similar to that.\n \n**Uses & Pairings:** Burley, Virginia, & Turkish tobaccos, Kiwi, & Honey. I found a few REAL tobaccos that used rose. Most of them used the same tobacco blends that i listed above. I found one hookah tobacco that used rose, virginia, kiwi, & honey.\n","author":"ebc88","title":"Tobacco Wild Rose","url":"https://redd.it/8chdnb","vendor":{"name":"Inawera","code":"INW"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"INW","title":"Tobacco Wild Rose"}},
