Generic fruit.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Flavor Description:** At a 4 day steep this tastes like pink bubblegum, mildly sweet. Very faint hint of artificial dragon fruit, not unpleasant. It's missing dragon fruit and that slight hint of tangy slightly sour note.\n\nAt a 4 week steep, this is a very nice bubblegum with a generic fruitiness in the back. Maybe at higher percentages the dragon fruit will become more prominent? It's not a juicy fruit type gum. It's the mouth watering big square of Bubblicious. The strength at 4% is moderate, but for a nice full flavored gum I would go to 6% and add additional fruit flavors.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:** Bubblegum\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit:** 1/10\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Pairings:** Almost any artificial or candy like fruit, mints.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Notes:** I am going to use this as a bubblegum honestly. I will try to make a nice tangy watermelon and a grape version of Bubblicious using candy or artificial flavorings rather than fresh fruits. It will be fun to see how that generic fruity back note will accent additional fruit flavors.","author":"mysticrosell","title":"Dragon Fruit","url":"https://redd.it/62rain","vendor":{"name":"Purilum","code":"PUR"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"PUR","title":"Dragon Fruit"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
