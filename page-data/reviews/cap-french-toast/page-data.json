    "result": {"data":{"reviewsJson":{"markdown":"**Setup:** Recoil w/ flavor barrel, Dual 15 wrap 26g 3mm Nifethal 70 coils @.18 ohms.  60w power, 450F temp limit. Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** CAP French Toast@ 4%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 25 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  French toast perfume.  This tastes like frozen french toast sticks smell while they bake.  Lightly fluffy flat bread, super buttery maple syrup with some vanilla, and slightly sour bakery cinnamon and nutmeg. Pervasive egginess.\n\nSweet, moderately thin inhale with bakery cinnamon and nutmeg notes.  Exhale just blooms into buttery maple with a hint of vanilla. Some white-bread fluffiness and a light thin custard note. Lingering metallic note and thin slightly bitter maple.\n\n**Off-flavors:** /u/vurve pinned it down for me in his [recipe development notes](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/4bki4j/blueberry_french_toast_v2/).  This tastes like the custard you soak bread in for french toast.  It's eggy.  May not be an off-flavor if you enjoy it.\n\n**Throat Hit:** 4/10.  Just a bit harsh and a little weird on the throat.\n\n**Uses:**  The essence of french toast.  Add some supporting flavors to push the aspects of this you want to the forefront.\n\n**Pairings:**  I'd push the egginess here, by adding some Cap Vanilla Custard v1.  Would go well with buttery creams and bright or jammy fruits.  Whiskey or liquid amber to give it some more warmth.  Joy or CDS for a more full breadiness.  Really, this is discontinued so if you have it just find a solid recipe and enjoy.\n\n**Notes:** Nightmare dark and (i'm guessing) probably half diketones by weight, this has been discontinued.  I wouldn't have mixed the tester if I had done my research beforehand, but I only figured that part out when I got to my second opinion googling.  I was iffy on posting on a review for something discontinued, but I figure there has to be people like me who impulse bought this, and then promptly didn't do anything with it.\n\nS&V testing, I like this up to about 3%. The thinness of the flavor becomes pretty pronounced above that.  There is a lot going on here, but it just doesn't cohere into a dense, thick flavor.  It's more a chorus of thinner flavors stacking on top of each other.  Even at something like 2% this is going to be unmistakable and would bully it's way into being a main note in the profile.\n \nIt's actually kind of a bummer that this got discontinued.  Just from my limited experience I haven't found a concentrate that works like this one. It's a really interesting, although super distinct, concentrate.  Apparently [RF has a french toast flavor](https://www.realflavors.com/products/french-toast) that may work as a sub.  I'd personally suggest mixing up a couple batches of /u/vurve/ 's [Blueberry French Toast v2](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/4bki4j/blueberry_french_toast_v2/) and chalk it up to the game.  Or just add it to your coffee with some cream.  Seem to works pretty well there too.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nI've linked it twice already, but seriously, just mix this if you have this laying around [Blueberry French Toast v2 by /u/vurve/](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/4bki4j/blueberry_french_toast_v2/).\n\n[Love it or hate it, from a vintage reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/2fk1j9/capella_french_toast/)\n\n[Vintage ECF Confustion](https://www.e-cigarette-forum.com/forum/threads/capella-french-toast.341178/)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"French Toast","url":"https://redd.it/5g58hs","vendor":{"name":"Capella","code":"CAP"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"CAP","title":"French Toast"}},
