No milk or oats, just the marshmallows bits.  It's not much like campfire marshamallow or Fluff marshmallow cream.\n\nSensations:  Some sweetness, similar to the taste of powdered sugar, appropriate to marshmallows.\n\nNotes:  At 2.5% the mix is strong, it could be used as stand alone.  At this percentage, I expect it to be noticed in a mix.\nI didn't detect any off flavors.\n\nUses:  A good candidate for a Lucky Charms cerial mix or a chocolate mix.","author":"VAPORMARK","title":"Marshmallow Candy SC","url":"https://redd.it/75jllc","vendor":{"name":"Real Flavors","code":"RF"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"RF","title":"Marshmallow Candy SC"}},
