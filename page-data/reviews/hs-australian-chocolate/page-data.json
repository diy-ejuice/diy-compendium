To me, this is a nice, smooth, somewhat sweet, dark chocolate. It's got a great flavor, but if you bring it too high, it's going to get dry and a little funky, so I think this works best as an accent to other chocolates or to give just a touch of cocoa to a mix. It is quite nice by itself, but then it's just chocolate and can be a little boring. I don't find it to be grainy necessarily, but it does have a bit of texture like you would expect from a dark chocolate. Overall, I think this is quite a nice flavoring, but I don't feel it will work as a solo chocolate for a full chocolate flavor. This is a fairly concentrated flavoring, so start low.\n\n**On the Nose**  \nCocoa\n\n**Recommended Usage**  \n*Stand alone*: 1%\n\n*In a mix*: 0.25%-0.75% \n\n**Throat**  \nMild\n\n**Ideal Pairings**  \nOther chocolates, cream, coffee, tobacco, berries.\n\n**Steep**  \nGive this one a good 3-5 days to homogenize.\n\n**Recipe Idea: [Thin Mint](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/8207)**  \n*Ratio: 15PG/85VG*  \n*Steep: 3 days* \n\n**Ingredient**|**%**|\n:--|:--|\nFLV Creme de Menthe|1.75%|\nHS Australian Chocolate|0.5%|\n\nFLV Creme de Menthe is the star here, but I felt to capture the essence of a Thin Mint it needed just a touch more of that chocolate, preferrably a darker chocolate that's slightly crisp, hence the HS Australian Chocolate.  \n\n*Please if your opinion differs, or you have another review for this post it in the comments.
