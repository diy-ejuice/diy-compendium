Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Flavor Revolution Custard, 1% and 3%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 35 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Fairly sour and relatively thin custard flavor.\n\nThe custard base here isn't quite clicking for me. Moderate eggy note, but no real dairy richness. Lighter take on custard in general... but then there is the butryic acid.  Even at 1% with over a month worth of a steep, this still tastes sour to me. It's not full on rancid like FA Yogurt at a month, but it's pretty prominent here.  After a month, the more vomity parts of this have mostly steeped out, but it still feels distractingly tart.  I know it's not the most accurate benchmark for vaping experience, but you get a face full of those sour notes when you're actually smelling the concentrate and in the room note.\n\nFlavor Revolution has a vanilla custard flavor, but I still think I'm getting a lighter vanilla.  Seems to have a light cinnamon kind of spice note to it as well.\n\nModerately dense overall, but seems on the thinner side for a custard.  I'm not getting that really heavy, smooth custard type base.  Seems to be a bit chalky and dry as opposed to buttery and rich.  Sweetness level feels pretty much on point, sweetened but not cloyingly frosting sweet.\n\nI don't have a comprehensive basis of comparison for custard flavors, but this isn't nearly as thick and rich as CAP V1 or INW Custard.  Maybe a bit thinner than FA with a heavier butyric note.  Actually reminds me quite a bit of FLV's straight custard flavor but that's missing the more aggressive sourness.\n\n**Off-Flavors:**  DAAP Free, but fairly heavy sour butryic note.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light.  Gets a bit chalky and dry for me.  Nothing really aggressive though.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 1%, this is sort of dry and flat.  That butryic note is still present, but pretty manageable as a tartness as opposed to a full blown sour dairy note.\n\nAt 3% I'm picking up some spice and vanilla.  Base has filled in a bit, I'm getting something eggy but still not a ton of richness. Still a bit on the dry side, going toward chalky.  Sour note is fairly aggressive.\n\nJust based on these tests, I'd probably be using this low as an accent flavor.  I'd probably be at around 1.5% to start.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Decent \"clean\" option for a custard flavor, but I still like FA Custard and FLV Custard more due to the less pronounced sour butyric notes.\n\nI don't think you're going to get around the sourness here.  May be more useful in adding a bit of richness to a yogurt or cheesecake flavor than trying to use this as a standalone custard base or \"richness\" kind of additive for a bakery.\n\n**Second Opinions:** [There's a note up on the ELR Page by user \"Silhouette\".  They write: \"Single Flavor tests starting at 2% (Private Recipe). FR flavors are potent, suggested percentages are around 2%. This is simply 'Custard' if you go looking for it at NR, not 'Vanilla Custard'. I can tell this has BA in some amount by taste, I can't tell yet if it going to affect flavor for me yet. We shall see.\"](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/203630)\n\n[Here's the product page from Nicotine River.  Their description: \"The one and only! Famous all throughout the e-liquid industry for its delicious capabilities! This Custard is a bit more on the milky side which is what makes it so unique! A perfect concentrate when mixed with other custards or dessert flavorings!\"  Milky is one way to describe it.](https://www.nicotineriver.com/products/flavor-revolution-custard)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Custard","url":"https://redd.it/7xcujp","vendor":{"name":"Flavor Revolution","code":"FR"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FR","title":"Custard"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
