I get at 10% a universal Vanilla, not too bright, not too dark, not too thick, and not too thin. Yes, I hate when people describe a flavor by what it is not. And now I am here in the middle of the ballpark of it. It's a great flavor at 10% and I could push it probably easily over 13% but why wasting this god-given vanilla.\nI can see this working with fruits as well as on and in cakes and bakeries. It is recommended by some good mixers to enhance vanilla mixes at 1-2%. \n\n**&#128313; Comments &#128313;**  \nThis concentrate is available at Bull City Flavors, Chef Flavours, or directly at Gremberry Farms. Recommended usage for me is 10 %.\nâ€ƒ","author":"Steve-TC","title":"Vanilla Overload","url":"https://redd.it/ro85kf","vendor":{"name":"Gremberry Farms Solo's","code":"GRM"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"GRM","title":"Vanilla Overload"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
