Very much of that smell comes through, though I feel the caramel notes are taking a backseat to the nutty tobacco. It does retain the sweetness I’d look for in an RY4, if that’s the direction you’d want to take Soho, assuming the caramel notes don’t become more prominent with a steep, they’ll need help to really flesh out the profile.\n\n**After a week:**      \nThis is still really nice. The sweet and nutty notes have gotten stronger, and it’s sort of makes me think hazelnuts. The tobacco is very well blended into the flavor. I wouldn't say it is particularly dark, dry, or leafy. It's very much a supporting note and the sweetness sort of buries any particularly distinct notes in the tobacco. I don’t think this is quite an RY4, I get no vanilla, but it’s very much in the same vein. I don’t know that the caramel notes are really any more forward than they were before, but the flavor is very much in balance. I could honestly vape this all day with little to no modification and be reasonably happy with the results.\n\n**Off notes:**    \nNothing off at 3%. I wouldn’t be shocked if this started to get a bit weird if you pushed it too high.\n\n**Throat hit:**   \nJust shy of nothing, it’s very smooth.\n\n**Suggested pairings:**      \nRicher tobaccos, caramels, nuts, clove, maybe even a cream if you’re feeling adventurous. It feels like this is very agreeable, sort of a “tobacco with training wheels” type flavor.\n\n[DIY_Ejuice’s Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)","author":"Foment_life","title":"Soho","url":"https://redd.it/dj5j7v","vendor":{"name":"Flavour Art","code":"FA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FA","title":"Soho"}},
