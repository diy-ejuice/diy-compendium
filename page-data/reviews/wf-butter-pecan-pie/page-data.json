Syrupy and heavy like a pecan pie. No pie crust that I am detecting. \n\n**Off-flavors:**  None\n\n**Throat Hit:** A little stingy on the tail end of the exhale but goes away after a few puffs.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  This would be good in creating a butter pecan ice cream or pralines and cream custard or something like where you want a sweeter nut type note in bakeries. I have a recipe I am working on where this might be a good replacement for fw butter pecan to add some additional sweetness. \n\n**Notes:** This is a very good standalone flavor at 5%. It has plenty of richness to compliment the nutty flavor. This is another flavor that is very sweet from Wonder Flavors so be aware that it will gunk your coils. These flavors are so sweet it makes me wonder if they are using fructose. \n\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"mlNikon","title":"Butter Pecan Pie","url":"https://redd.it/5pldd9","vendor":{"name":"Wonder Flavors","code":"WF"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"WF","title":"Butter Pecan Pie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
