I personally have noticed that they are indeed great early on in the steep. Tobacco heads should be particularly pleased by this knowledge, considering we're used to steeping our baccos as long as it takes to age a good single malt scotch whiskey.*\n\n**Specs:**\n\n- percentage used: 5%\n- 4 day steep \n- PG/VG ratio: 50/50\n- vaped on Digiflavor Siren GTA MTL, SS316L, 26 gauge, 0.60 ohm coil, 12-18 watts\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Flavor Properties:**\n\n- roll your own type tobacco\n- full body\n- lightly sweet, spicy\n- spice adds brightness, while the sweet note smooths out the overall profile\n- medium complexity\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Relatable Flavors:**\n\n- tastes like how fresh, lightly aromatic tobacco smells\n- spicy tobacco leaf\n- touch of honey on the exhale\n- medium ash\n- when smelling the juice in bottle I get subtle nut, like Acetyl Pyrazine, it does not jump out at you when vaping but I believe it's hiding under the spice and honey, adding body to the profile\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Mouth Feel:**\n\n- medium/thick density\n- sharp (spice note) on the inhale, smooth on the exhale with spice moving to the background\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:**\n\n- none\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Position In A Recipe:**\n\n- top note or middle note\n- makes a great focal point in a recipe, even as a top note, it could be the star of the show\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Pairings:**\n\n- dark tobaccos (cigar, burley)\n- strong tobaccos (perique, latakia)\n- other spicy tobaccos (INW Am4a, FLV Kentucky Blend)\n- Irish Cream (Might make angel's sing, no promises but could be what clouds in heaven taste like. Pretty sure though.)\n- dark, rich vanilla (example: Vanilla Bourbon of your choice)\n- fig, raisin, plum, prune (to mimic that note many of us smell in fresh tobacco)\n- dry nut (example: FLV Pistachio)\n- Acetyl Pyrazine (like 0.25%)\n- cream\n- custard\n- bonus: citrus flavor like a bright orange would take it in a completely different direction and might add that 'je ne sais quoi\" to a mix\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Suggested Percentage:**\n\n- 3-5% for full on bold flavor \n- 1% or less for top note.\n- I've recently tried upping FLV tobaccos to a whopping 8% and the flavors hold true. If you like it extra bold, you can certainly take it there without causing weird off notes.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- Oh ya, she's a keeper.\n- Consider this a cousin of Kentucky Blend. Fairly similar I'd say. Native Tobacco is a bit sweeter with that honey note. I'm glad I own both. Will have to try pairing them.\n- Very, very vapeable as a single flavor but this baby will be great for spicing up a dark tobacco.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Suggested Recipe:**\n\n- have only spent an hour or so with the flav but I'm gonna work on a roll your own type recipe. Native Tobacco front and centre, dark rich tobacco in the background, fig/plum/raisin/or prune as a top note, and maybe a lil INW Dirty Neutral Base to dirty up the mix.","author":"T_Mace","title":"Native Tobacco","url":"https://redd.it/5dtasm","vendor":{"name":"Flavorah","code":"FLV"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FLV","title":"Native Tobacco"}},
