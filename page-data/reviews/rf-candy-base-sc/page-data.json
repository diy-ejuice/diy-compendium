Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** RF SC Candy Base @ 1% and 2.5%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 16 days, others noted\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Real flavors doesn't really specify what type of \"candy\" this is supposed to be, but tasting this solo it seems to have a fluffier texture, a sort of indistinct fruitiness, and a a pretty solid sweetness.  Kind of like CAP Jelly Candy, with less of a jellied vibe and some marshmallow stuck in there as well.  \n\nI can't really peg to this a specific type of candy, but it seems to thin out, fluff up, and add a bit of bitterness to whatever it's mixed with.  It actually doesn't seem to sweeten the added concentrate all that noticeably.  I'd stick to using this to thin and fluff out mixtures, especially those involving syrupy fruits. I got better results at 1% than higher, so I'd probably start at .5% and work up from there.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Solo, not really. It doesn't really taste like \"candy\" by itself, but there's nothing aggressive or \"bad\" tasting. Mixed, this really seems to push a non-chemical but still pretty odd bitterness up in the other concentrates it's mixed with.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Solo, Light.  Sweetness is just a bit dry and slightly harsh.  Mixed, I don't really notice any increased throat hit.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I've mixed up my usual candy-type base testers with this.\n\n**1% RF SC Candy Base, 2% DIYFS Holy Vanilla:** Getting a lot of marshmallow out of this. The texture here does seem to be pushing everything towards a ligher, fluffier mouthfeel while the vanilla seems to be a bit thinner than usual, but still very present. Also seems to be pushing some light, slightly artificial tasting bitterness up toward the front of the mix. Based on this test, I'd say it'll take creams more toward marshmallow than anything else. Definitely present at 1%.\n\n**2% RF SC Candy Base, 3% FW Root Beer**  This is a bit odd. Spice notes from the root beer seem to be dialed back quite a bit.  Texture is fluffy, but the flavor seems to be a bit thin and almost watery. Same kind of artificial bitterness as was present in the holy vanilla test, but obviously a bit more intense. Strangely unsatisfying in the way it's thinning out the root beer.\n\n**3% RF SC Candy Base, 4% OSDIY Blue Raspberry Slush**  Again, big fluffy volume, but a muted, thinner flavor from the added concentrate, and a kind of bitter sour note overall.  I'm missing most of the Juicyness from the Blue Raspberry Slush and getting watery instead. Mostly just makes me not want to vape Blue Raspberry Slush.\n\nBased on these tests, I'd pretty much stick to using this at a low percentage with juicier, syrupy fruits to lighten them up and dial back the wetness there.  I think there are some niche applications with creams in general, but it's going to make your cream into more of a marshmallow flavor.\n\n**Notes:**  This seems to be fairly strong when mixed, of the tests the most pleasant was definitely 1%, but even that is a bit overbearing. I'd start at .5% and work up.\n\nI'm interested to see how this compares to their taffy base, so I'll try that one tomorrow.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nNot really, unfortunately.\n\n[Here's the product page from Real Flavors.
