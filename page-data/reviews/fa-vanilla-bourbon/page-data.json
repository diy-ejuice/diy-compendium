Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FA Vanilla Bourbon @ 2%, 60% VG, 40% VG, Steeped 30 days\n\n**Flavor Description:** Warm vanilla, rather than a candy or extract vanilla.  Moderate sweetness, light to moderate density.  Warming effect is similar to a really light bakery cinnamon or even TFA Kentucky Bourbon.  Nothing that tastes remotely like those flavors, but the overall effect is similar.\n\nInhale is warm, moderately sweet and moderately dense vanilla.  Really middle-of-the-road in the best way. Some floral notes here with a richer cream-soda type base. Light exhale with a light natural tasting sweetness.  Vanilla note here is a little thin, floral without being perfumey. Overall warmth stays with you throughout the exhale and lingers a bit. \n\n**Off-flavors:**  Tiny bit of raw alcohol bite in the middle of the exhale, mostly noticeable with sustained use.  I only started to notice it after about 5ml vaped solo.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Warming effect is pronounced, maybe a tiny bit of throat hit but very minimal.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I'd use this primarily for lighter creams, milkshake bases without a malty base, and less aggressive ice creams.  FLV Cream and FA Cream Fresh spring to mind, although it may highlight that tiny spice note in FLV Cream. Not a lot of extra creaminess here, so your cream base's thickness is going to be dependent on the cream mix you're using.\n\nWarming effect would be great for anything with cinnamon, especially horchatas. Probably a bit thin but workable for bakeries as well, especially the icing on a cinnamon roll.\n\nA good fit for thinning out heavier chocolates while adding a little more nuance and texture.\n\nGood vanilla for tobacco mixes. Relative thinness and light warmness shouldn't make your tobaccos too creamy while giving a solid vanilla note.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nConcentrate is fairly dark but seems to be okay on coils so\nS&V concentration testing, light and floral, almost bitter at %.5 and 1%.  This is really nice starting at 1.5%. Vanilla fills in a bit and the sweetness definitely shows up as does that warming effect. Largely similar but more saturated at 2%. 2.5% and above gets a pretty heavy extract type of vibe and seems to kill a lot of the nuance and charm. I'd mix with this at 1.5% to 2% for a full vanilla note with that warming quality. I don't think this is a good fit for a one-shot or primary note in a mix.\n\n[**INW Vanilla Bourbon Flavor Review**](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/5lqd8s/inw_vanilla_bourbon/)\n\n[**TFA Vanilla Bourbon Flavor Review**](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/5lqdpb/tfa_vanilla_bourbon/)\n\nReally simple take on the available Vanilla Bourbon concentrates: INW reads marshmallow, TFA reads malty extract, and FA reads as a warm vanilla additive.  I'd use INW for strong, bright marshmallowy vanilla in a fruit mix or over the top rich mixes, TFA for heavy custards and bakeries without spice, and FA for lighter creams and bakeries with a bit of spice as well as nutty or tobacco mixes.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[So there is another review for this concentrate by /u/Jigsaw314.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/4mgy4i/vanilla_bourbon_fa/)  Comments are closed on the post, otherwise I would have just left this as a comment. I don't try to duplicate people's work, I just really wanted to go through the vanilla bourbons as a trio.\n\n[ELR is mostly just copies of the review above and HIC's notes, although there are couple other notes scattered throughout.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/399)\n\n[User Jamie on ECX reports that it's better than McCormick's. Either a hillarious dry joke, or just funny as hell.](http://www.ecigexpress.com/diy-e-liquid/browse-flavorings/beverage-flavors/vanilla-bourbon-by-flavourart.html)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Vanilla Bourbon","url":"https://redd.it/5lqejv","vendor":{"name":"Flavour Art","code":"FA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FA","title":"Vanilla Bourbon"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
