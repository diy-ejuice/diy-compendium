Until today, the only watermelon I've been able to handle is from a commercial juice company made by the grand master /u/frock_donghammer. There's nothing really special going on here but the flavor hits the mark as far as what I would expect. Scrap any thoughts of a fresh watermelon and think candy. Normally, I'd oppose a candy based flavor but the way this comes through is fantastic. Remember the watermelon Jolly ranchers? Well this watermelon hits that exact flavor almost perfectly. It is smooth and full flavor at 3% but I did start to pick up some harsher notes on the 6% mix, sort of a dry burn sensation that I'd normally get from any Watermelon. So keeping this lower on the scale is a must for myself but as with any flavor, everyone is different so experiment for yourself. Overall, well done Watermelon that I am looking forward to playing with further.\n\n**Off Flavors**\n\n*Like I said, on the higher side of mix percentage I picked up a bit of a chemical burn that was noticeably harsh,on the lower side it was gone and overall very smooth*\n\n**Possible Pairings**\n\n*I think solo at 2-3% it would make a nice straight watermelon flavor, maybe a touch of Sweetener to give it some Pzazz. In a mix I'd say toss it down to 0.75-1.5% depending on how much pop you're going for. I tossed this together with Great Lakes Blueberry and Great Lakes Cheesecake and it turned out pretty interesting,the Blueberry watermelon combo is real nice and the Cheesecake provided a bit of a smoother, creamier feeling*","author":"Lampburglar","title":"Watermelon","url":"https://redd.it/7fkw1w","vendor":{"name":"Great Lakes Flavor Co","code":"GLF"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"GLF","title":"Watermelon"}},
