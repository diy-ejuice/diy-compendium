This stuff is used \nin many processed foods and in cigarette filters to smooth out harsh notes. It \ndoes this by temporarily numbing certain taste receptors in your tongue. This is \nthe reason you can stomach breakfast cereals, microwave meals, and all the added \npaper and other trash they put in commercial cigarettes. Likewise, it can make \nsome ejuices tolerable, maybe even tasty, that without it would be abominable. \nThis stuff is actually amazing. If you really suck at DIY, and your juice tastes \nlike an abortion, you need this stuff; it can save even some of the worst tasting \nmixes. SIDENOTE: Triacetin is also the most amazing coil cleaner! It actually does \nfor cotton what conditioner does for hair; VG slowly clogs wicks, and PG makes the \nfibers brittle, but AAA unclogs wicks and plasticizes fibers, leaving them \nflexible once more.\"  \n\n\"Isobutavan- Sold by TPA, and is a main ingredient of MTS Vape Wizard by FA, \nSmooth by TPA, and Flavor Toner/Enhancer by FW. This is the \"thickening\" agent in \nthe aforementioned enhancers. It does not actually thicken your juice any, but \nalters the mouth feel of the vapor to seem thicker. It also cancels the vapor \nthinning effect of some flavorings, thus making your clouds appear denser. Too \nmuch of it makes everything taste like vanilla.\"  \nOl' Doc Porter from EFC  \n\n**Nose Neat**  \n\nAcetone, Fruity.  \n\n\n**Flavor Description:**  \n\n\nOily, fatty, smooth.
