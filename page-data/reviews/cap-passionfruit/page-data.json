Can be excellent standalone at highest percentages.\n\n**Pairings:** Berries and other fruits, whipped cream or vanilla, would taste great in a custard\n","author":"LiquidIce25","title":"Passionfruit","url":"https://redd.it/4nrhdq","vendor":{"name":"Capella","code":"CAP"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"CAP","title":"Passionfruit"}},
