Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** SC Pineapple, .5 and 2%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 8 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  Candy pineapple, pretty spot on to haribo white gummy bears. Very sweet and relatively simple. Some actual tartness in there but pretty overwhelmed by that sweet candy base. Moderately dense vape with a good deal of heavy mouthfeel to it, pretty spot on for a candy flavor.  I wouldn't overthink this one, You may want to blend with a bit of tarter TPA Pineapple or INW Pineapple if you want to nudge this slightly in the direction of realism or just accent around it for a candy pineapple profile.  2% seems like a good starting point assuming you're going to steep for a week. Tartness seems to fade pretty quickly though, so maybe 1% for a Shake and Vape.\n\nInhale has a bit of tartness up front. Not like full on fresh pineapple tart, but at least a bit of zip to it. Building candy pineapple sweetness underneath. Tastes like actual sugar, no artificial sweetener or heavy sucralose notes. Moderately dense, with a light harshness. Exhale is basically just candy pineapple. White gummy bears, par excellence. Some really subtle tartness that breaks up the candy sweetness, but that same really heavy sugary candy sweetness. Seems to be a bit on the warm side, assuming the temp control on my mod hasn't gone wonky.  Tarter notes keep this from tasting completely flat, but it's a more linear, non-realistic, heavily sweet candy flavor. Again, fairly dense for a fruit and a bit of harshness from all that sweetness. Lingering sugar lips.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Nah, really heavy on the candy side, but nothing weird or off.  Seems to vape quite a bit warmer than I'd expect? Not 100% sure what would be causing that, but I've had to bump down the temperature on the mod a couple times.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light. All that hot sweetness can get just a bit harsh.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Candy pineapple is the obvious one. I wouldn't think this needs any additional sweetness, just your texture of choice. Should work relatively well with the FW candy texturizers or FLV Candy Roll.\n\nThere may be some use for this for a heavily sweet pineapple juice note when mixed with brighter, lighter flavors.\n\nIf you wanted to go a bit more realistic, or least more tart, you could use this for a base with a TPA Pineapple or INW Pineapple accent.\n\nCould theoretically work for a sweet syrupy pineapple in a bakery.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nConcentration testing, this seems really linear. At .25%, it's mostly just sweet with a tarter pineapple hit. Still tastes a little thin and unsaturated. Freshly mixed, .5% is actually pretty solid. Tart but still fairly sweet pineapple. Not a lot of nuance, but a pretty full flavor. After a week though, that tartness is lacking and it's a dull, flat sweet pineapple. At 1% it's just more. Bright pineapple tartness and a sweet candy base. 1.5% is getting sweeter, tartness level seems unchanged. At 2% fresh, this is pretty intense pineapple. Actually feeling a bit too acidic. A week out though, this seems to be sweet spot between the sweetness while still retaining some of that tartness. 3% fresh is almost cloying sweet, and that pineapple feels a bit harsh and acidic. 4% fresh is officially too sweet and acidic for me.\n\nThat bright pineapple tartness seems to fade out pretty quick. I did some testing with this between days 3 and 6, and that brightness seems to fade pretty dramatically. I think this flavor runs the risk of fading out entirely to that white gummy bear flavor as it steeps out past a week.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nPretty thin documentation and isn't super helpful.\n\n[I picked this up from BCF as \"Super Concentrates\" brand, but it's also available through Vaping Zone. Two reviews on their site. User \"Lawrence Hall\" is succinct: \"5% is nice - needs some tart.\"  \"The Good Witch\" gives it 5 stars and adds: \"I make this for a couple of people. I make it with 2.5%, 40 pg and 60 vg. They love it and can't get enough of it.\"](https://www.vapingzone.com/Pineapple-Concentrated-Flavor/pid-530.html)\n\n[One tiny note on ELR. User \"csardaz\" says: \"3% @ 18hours is pretty weak - I think 4-5% and some tart. 3%@6days still weak still needs tart 5%+. 5% is very nice.\"](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/7465)\n\n[User \"Aheadatime\" on ECF (in 2013) said \"VZ SC gives me a great blackberry, mango, and pineapple.\" Like I said, thin documentation.](https://www.e-cigarette-forum.com/forum/threads/vaping-zone-super-concentrates-vs-hangsens-concentrates.459690/)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**\n\nH/T to /u/IDI0-T for the suggestion.\n\n[Bonus video review link for a couple of SC Fruits.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvX1V5-8BD0)","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Pineapple","url":"https://redd.it/6o5okr","vendor":{"name":"Super Concentrated","code":"SC"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"SC","title":"Pineapple"}},
