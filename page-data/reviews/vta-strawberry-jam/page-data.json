This flavour can be used in multiple recipes from bakery such as jam filled donuts to PBSJ breads and many more. As a sweet strawberry this could also aid with dairy/ slushy and even ice- cream eliquid recipes.\" \n\n**NOTES:** Tested on back of hand after mixing it tasted like a strawberry hard candy.  After it steeped for 2 weeks I tried it again. It was still very candy like, but kind of has the mouthfeel of a jam or jelly. It really reminds me of the Brach's Strawberry Bon Bons candy with the chewy center. It really seems to coat the tongue the flavor sticks around for a while after you vape it. At times I felt like I was getting some ws-23 like coolness on the tail end of the exhale, but it was present through the testing. This is worth picking up if you are into strawberry candy vapes. I wouldn't call or use this as jam in my opinion though.\n\n**Pairings:** Candies, Creams, & Bakeries","author":"ebc88","title":"Strawberry Jam","url":"https://redd.it/8gbo7e","vendor":{"name":"Vape Train Australia","code":"VTA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"VTA","title":"Strawberry Jam"}},
