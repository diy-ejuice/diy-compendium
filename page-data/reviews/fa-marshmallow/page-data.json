    "result": {"data":{"reviewsJson":{"markdown":"Noticed this was missing from the master flavor list, so here it is!\n\n**Setup:** Velocity mini clone; Dual Clapton coils (24/34) at 0.3 ohms with 5 wraps on 65 watts. Full wicking.\n\n**Percentage/Steep:** Tested at 2.8%. Started with no steep, finished at two weeks steeped.\n\n**Mouthfeel:** Has a light to medium heaviness with a medium density. Smooth, but was a touch harsh (3/10) at the very end of the vape until after a week steep - then just smooth.\n\n**Flavor Notes:** Starts as a slightly sweet marshmallow that is more sugar than anything else. After a week steep the flavor starts to develop a bit more, still sweet but tastes less 'fluffy' and more like a marshmallow found in cereal. At the end of a two week steep the cereal marshmallow taste shines best because the pure sugar taste dies off as does the 'fluffiness' of a regular marshmallow.\n\n**Relatable Flavors:** Like the marshmallows found in Lucky Charms.\n\n**Off-flavors:** Weird plastic-like taste is present at the front of the vape for the first three days but dies down after a week steep. \n\n**Position in Recipe:** Works great to add volume or density to a vape when used in the base or as an accent note. Also can add a bit of sweetness to fruit mixes.\n\nAs usual, please let me know anything I can do to improve my notes, or post your own notes/opinions on this flavoring in the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n","author":"wafflepriest1","title":"Marshmallow","url":"https://redd.it/4vzxc9","vendor":{"name":"Flavour Art","code":"FA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FA","title":"Marshmallow"}},
