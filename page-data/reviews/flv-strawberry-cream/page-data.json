This is not very much like a strawberry cream candy like the Flavorah blurb states; in fact, this would need a lot of help to get there. I think it would be easier to replicate that profile without this concentrate than to shape this concentrate into it. if you do want to try that approach I would use this very low as an accent. I get some of the same off-flavors that were present in the other FLV strawberries I reviewed (shoes/medicine), but not as potent. the long steep seems to have done nothing to diminish the off-flavors, which is unfortunate because this flavor is really good in every other aspect. judging by the mixed reviews on the other FLV strawberries I tried, I would venture to say that these off-flavors will not be tasted by everyone so YMMV.\n\n**Off-flavors:** strawberry shoes, cough syrup.\n\n**Throat Hit:** none.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:** this is a strawberry cream, so strawberries and cream is an obvious choice. this might work in a strawberry banana recipe or a strawberry milkshake/ice cream/etc. provided the off-flavors don't scare you away. 1% seems strong enough as a standalone but I would start even lower in a mix lest the dreaded shoe taste shows up for you.\n\n**Notes:** I've been very busy with finals and research papers lately so I haven't dropped a review in some time. this is the last of the FLV strawberry flavors that /u/concreteriver sent me for testing (thanks again) and I will be back to reviewing the LNW line soon!\n\n**Second Opinions:** I didn't find any so here's the FLV Description: Like the strawberry cream hard candy. This strawberry cream benefits from additions of both strawberry and cream if you are trying to pull it in a particular direction, but can stand alone if you have the candy strawberry note in mind.\n\n","author":"PerennialPhilosopher","title":"Strawberry Cream","url":"https://redd.it/6iepug","vendor":{"name":"Flavorah","code":"FLV"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FLV","title":"Strawberry Cream"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
