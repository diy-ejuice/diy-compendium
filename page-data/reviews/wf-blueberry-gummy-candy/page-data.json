This is my first flavour review, and I actually think first actual post to the sub besides commenting. I decided to grab this flavour because it caught my eye and I saw that there wasn't really notes on it. I hope this helps some people in gauging if they want to pick up this flavour or not :)\n\n**Hardware:** Fused Claptons 26Gx2/36G SS, 6 wraps @ 3.5mm. Voopoo Drag & Asmodus C4 @ 60W\n\n**Mixing:** I mixed this concentrate at 40/60  VG PG, and at 2.5, 3.5, and 5%. I let all of these steep at least a week too, but nothing super amazing changed overtime. I’d even wager that the blueberry taste slightly faded over this time.\n\n**Flavor profile:** 2.5% - At this percent, on inhale I was hit with a very sweet gummy flavour that filled up my mouth. The mouth feel was pretty damn good too, but could use some help. On exhale, I got a very slight candied blueberry - nothing profound though, leaving me wanting more on the blueberry part.\n\n3.5% - I think this is where the flavour could shine as a main ingredient. The sweet gummy inhale was still there, but along with it came a sweet blueberry that carried out on exhale. I immediately think of the gummy sharks with the white underbellies and blue top at this %. The mouthfeel is a tad bit better too, and doesn’t get too gummy / weird. I do think the blueberry is still a bit unpronounced though, could probably do with a .5% increase\n\n5% - Definitely a sweet spot for this concentrate. I could taste the blueberry much better. Nothing else really changed.\n\n**Throat hit:** Minimal, if none.\n\n**Uses:** 2-3% - this could be used to boost gummy candy profiles nicely, especially ones surrounding any sort of “blue”.4-5% - Could be the main profile of a blueberry gummy candy. Throw in something to boost up the gummy a bit and I could imagine it working very well. It also could probably work in something like a sweeter take on a blueberry shake / smoothie too honestly.\n\n**Pairings:** Anything gummy like CAP Jelly Candy, and a candied blueberry like HS Blueberry are amazing pairings with this.\n\n**Off-flavors:** I don’t get any off-notes, but I don’t think I’d push it past 5% either. This definitely isn’t a good hard candy option for a recipe.\n\n**Second opinions:** I’ve found none as of right now actually!\n\n**Notes:** I went ahead and made a recipe to showcase this concentrate - as there seems to be only one as of now using it publically.
