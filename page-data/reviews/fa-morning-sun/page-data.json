Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** FA Morning Sun, 1 and 2.5%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 5 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:**  FlavourArt calls this \"A milky flavour carefully blended with the sweetness of freshly cut fruit ... the perfect continental all day breakfast!\" I definitely get some kind of cream component here.  It doesn't have a strong diary note, more of a flat sweet cream with a heavier body to it. There's a lighter pastry note in here.  It's a bit soft next to that cream, but there is almost puff pastry taste on the back end of that cream.  There is definitely some sort of fruit as well, but it's pretty well blended with the cream and nothing really calls attention to it.  I've tasted melon, berries, and peach in here while vaping.  Not sure what's supposed to be in there, but there's a dry floral edge to the fruit note.  It's a very well done, cohesive take on a full profile but it feels a bit too busy, and a bit too light.  It's a decent single flavor if you want something lighter, but this could easily be accented with creams, heavier bakeries, or brighter fruits.  Seems to get a bit too floral at higher percentages, I'd mix with this around 2%.\n\nInhale is hard to pick apart, but I'm getting mostly cream. Fairly dense body, but a lighter flavor to it. Not a lot of dairy or richness but a thick, smooth texture. Theres a light, soft bakery edge to this that really creeps in as the inhale goes on. Some vaguely fruity sweetness, but fairly mellow.  Sharper floral top notes, pretty noticeable at higher percentages. Exhale opens up on that creamy pastry. The weight of the cream and the softness of the bakery note kind of melt together. Fruit comes in after that.  There's a floral note up high, and the fruit itself is definitely some kind of fruit mix without too many sharp edges that call attention to themselves. I do get a bit of melon, I think.  There's a touch of recognizable melon rind in here.  I want to say it's a honeydew, but it's not too distinct. There's also some red berry sweetness in here. Not sure if it's a strawberry or raspberry, but there's a floral component that feels like it belongs to a berry.  I'm also getting some heavier kind of peachy sweetness. Some lingering floral notes, and a bit of dry chalkiness on the tail end of the exhale.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Not 100% sure what's supposed to be here, but the fruit has some solid floral notes to it.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Moderate.  This has a bit of traditional harshness and a sharp, floral edge.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  If you're into lighter, delicate flavors and don't mind some florals this is a pretty decent single flavor around 2-2.5%.  Cream, pastry, and fruit all in there but it's a bit unsatisfying.\n\nUsing this in mixes, I think this could be taken in a couple different directions based on what you want to accentuate. That cream note could stand some bolstering with either FLV Cream or FA Fresh Cream.  I could also see taking in a yogurt direction.  The pastry note would be a decent base for something with a bit more AP to give a more solid bakery component. This could definitely use some additional brighter stronger fruit as well.\n\nThis tastes light and sort of generic enough to thicken up fruit and cream recipes with that heavy mouthfeel without completely dominating a mix.\n\n**Notes:**  Concentration testing, .25% and .5% are definitely on the light side.  At 1% I get mostly the cream and pastry out of this. There is some fruitiness to it, but nothing all that specific or defined. At 1.5% fruit is starting to pick up a bit, still in the background but seems more like a discrete component.  At 2% I'm getting more nuance from the fruit but it's getting a bit floral.  At 2.5% fruit sweetness is coming through but that floral note is more pronounced. At 3% is maybe a bit too floral for me, and at 4% it's gets downright perfumey.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\n[Here's the ELR Page.  User \"Amy***\" writes: \"Starts off as a strong condensed milk then mellows into a sweeter cream that turns into a fruit blend of mixed fruit I want to think there is mandarin hard to discern the fruit profiles very light and not candy sweet just right. I tried this out as a SnV at 3.5% Max Vg on a dripper I think this one will steep really well and I'd probably start it around 1-3% in a mix.\"](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/102143)\n\n[A couple of mixed reviews on BCF.  User \"Matthew DiSarle\" says \"The flavor by itself isn't bad at all. I found it's good supporting a very bright fruit. Like strawberry or watermelon. Have it at 2% or 3% and have your primary fruit atleast 5% higher or morning sun will take over completely.\"  User \"CBH\" reports something closer to my experience: \"It isn't a horrible flavor just once again not my thing. Lot of fresh cream is in it, their \"grease\" flavor and some vague fruits. I think Flavourart flavors are certainly unique and interesting I just don't want to vape them lol.\"](http://www.bullcityflavors.com/morning-sun-fa/)\n\n[And the very definition of mixed reviews on ECX.  Two reviews.  Here is the 5-star from user \"beaufort batches\":  Another strong flavor that is great if it is mixed properly. Adds tasty depth to creamy desserts or fruity bakery recipes.\"  And the 1-star from the one, the only, \"vtecHu$tler\":  \"The title says it all because it tastes and smeels like a beer that's been sitting out in the morning sun! lol for real tho buy at your own risk!\"](http://www.ecigexpress.com/shop/diy-e-liquid/diy-e-liquid-flavors/flavourart-usa/flavourart-sweet-flavors/morning-sun-by-flavourart.html)\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**\n\nShoutout to /u/ID10-T for suggesting for review.\n\n[Link to a bonus, rambling video review where I take weird digressions into blended and complex flavourart flavors while doing a first test of FA Morning Sun, Cocoon, and Summer Clouds.](https://youtu.be/BUYazRP62tA)","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Morning Sun","url":"https://redd.it/6rxen0","vendor":{"name":"Flavour Art","code":"FA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FA","title":"Morning Sun"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
