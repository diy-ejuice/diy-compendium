After doing a little research, it seems like it's supposed to be similar to a cherry, and some even say it tastes like [cotton candy](http://tastylandscape.com/2013/04/26/aratiles-tree-cultivating-the-cotton-candy-flavored-fruit/).\n\n**0.5%:** \n\nThe overall flavor is very faint, but there's a notable, generic sweetness. Not a distinct cherry flavor at this percentage, but I can understand why this is sometimes called \"cotton candy fruit.\" It feels like I'm on the verge of getting a fruit snack type of flavor, and it seems like it would get juicier if pushed higher. Really too light here to provide much in the way of flavor, but could be used at this percentage to help sweeten berries or other fruits. No distinct or noticeable off-notes.\n\n**1%:**\n\nThis becomes a bit artificial-tasting, but not necessarily candy. We're definitely entering a cherry-like territory here. It's more reminiscent of a cherry juice than it is an actual cherry, and it's juicy property is a lot more noticeable. Still very sweet. It has decent mouthfeel for a lighter fruit flavor without being jammy or cloyingly sweet. The overall flavor is light enough at this percent where its flavor would probably be overpowered but its sweetness and juiciness wouldn't be.\n\n**2%:**\n\nIt seems like the flavor really opens up here. The juicy sweetness sits very far upfront, and there's a very, very slight bitterness/astringency in the backseat. It reminds me of a cherry version of TPA Raspberry Sweet. This is very much a sweet cherry flavor rather than a tart, fleshy one. It has the canned cherry taste without the jammy density and stickiness. At this percent, it's like the flavor is trying to be a jam, but it just doesn't have the heavier weight to throw around. This makes me think something like FLV Boysenberry could really nudge it in the proper direction. I still wouldn't call this a candy cherry, but it would do great in that type of profile. It's a solid middle note at this level- not quite bright enough to be a powerful accent and not potent or heavy enough to act as a sturdy base.\n\n**3%:**\n\nDoesn't change much at all from 2% (maybe the flavor is a hair stronger than previously), but the astringency is easy to pick up on at this percent. I don't think it's bad enough to ruin a mix, but it might need something to cover it up. While the flavor doesn't change much, it manages to get just a little it sweeter. Almost too sweet (maybe that's what's causing the almost bitter aftertaste?).\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\nThis flavor offers a decent artificial, sweet cherry note that will shine the most when used with other fruits. It'd be great in beverages, and with enough support, I could see this being used in certain bakeries. I think some people might find the sweetness a little cloying, and for this same reason, I'm not sure it's the best candidate to pair with anything dairy. Personally, I'd also avoid anything spiced and probably tobaccos, too. Overall, it's a solid middle note. You know how a lot of people use TPA Marshmallow to round out sharp edges? This could fill that same role in a fruit profile with sharp edges without sacrificing juiciness and without muting nuances. Frankly, I'm just relieved that I didn't pick up any sort of medicinal note, but there is definitely an astringency starting at around 2% of which you should be aware.\n\n\n\n\n","author":"PepperMyJabrill","title":"Kerson","url":"https://redd.it/9er804","vendor":{"name":"Health Cabin","code":"HC"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"HC","title":"Kerson"}},
