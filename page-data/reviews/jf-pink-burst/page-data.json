I haven't had a chance to try them all and dont have them all in front of me. \n\nOne flavor that stood out was Pink Burst, which I can only  assume is pink starburst or strawberry taffy. \n\nTo be blunt: I think this might be jungle flavors version of Capellas strawberry taffy flavor, but haven't actually tried that one. I did notice I had some other Jungle Flavors that seemed like renditions of other popular choices such as biscuit and Fuji. Those two  struck me as smelling better than their original counterparts. This isn't the first time I've seen manufacturers release similar flavors such as fa's soho which seems like a clone of INW's scamel. Competition between manufacturers benefits consumers. \n\nOn to the review...\n\nPink Burst 2% in 70/30 vg/pg on dual coil low resistance rda\n\nHmm I don't really like  Pink starburst (I ate some last week) but this actually tastes better than the candy. I Still get a. Strawberry taffy/candy taste from this. However on my setup the vape is warm, and warm starburst flavor is kinda weird to vape.\n\nKoolada might help that. \nOddly enough I like the strawberry banana starburst and have high hopes for  recreating that.\nMy girlfriend loves pink Starburst so this flavor is definitely a winner in my book. however it's not a single flavor vape to me and that's fine. \n\nECX accomplished what they set out to do on this one.  It's good, but I feel like they really hit the ball out of the park with their juicy lemon flavor. They also offer a regular strawberry flavor that was decent, but ultimately didn't stand out to me vs the other manufacturers out there which are all really similar. \n\n\nI might try 3% for dripping higher VG mixes.\n\nSorry for the weird formatting Im doing this on the phone.
