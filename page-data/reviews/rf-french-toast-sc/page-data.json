This tastes exactly like real french toast dipped and/or drizzled in artificial maple syrup. The egg soaked, fried bread comes through in a very, *very* pleasant way. There is plenty of buttery goodness here and the syrup is balanced really well. This is already very sweet tasting. Real Flavors page describes cinnamon, however I don't taste any (it could just be very subtle).\n\n**Off-flavors:** none!\n\n**Throat Hit:** nope!\n\n**Uses and Pairings:** I could vape this solo. Solo percent could be 1-2%. This has a lot of potential for any waffle, pancake, or crepe type profiles. The artificial syrup is perfect and the actual french toast would blend well with your other bakery notes at around 0.5-1.5%. \n\n**Notes:** /u/ConcreteRiver usually does concentration testing here, but I'm not a shiny golden flavor god like he is. I'll use this space to link to the [Real Flavors page](http://www.realflavors.com/shop/french-toast/)\n\n**Second Opinions:** jombo (on e-cigarette-forum.com) says \"you can actually taste the egg in it yummy stuff\" and \"french toast was great also amazing to taste that egg in that sweet syrup and still taste the very light AP (bread).\"\n\nLater in the thread Fozzy71 discovers, after attempting all kinds of 'speed steeping', that time-steeping his juice is making it taste better(who knew?), and that RF (SC) French Toast is delicious\n\n[There is so much discussion about RF here that i thought id just link the whole thread. They discuss many other flavors for your reading pleasure](https://www.e-cigarette-forum.com/forum/threads/real-flavors.759571/)\n\n","author":"PerennialPhilosopher","title":"French Toast SC","url":"https://redd.it/644zst","vendor":{"name":"Real Flavors","code":"RF"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"RF","title":"French Toast SC"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
