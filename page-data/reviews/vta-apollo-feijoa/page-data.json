Tested fresh and once a week after. Tested @ 5% & 7%\n\n**VTA'S Description:** \" exotic feijoa fruit (found in New Zealand)flavour thatâ€™s juicy with a sweet sensation . Also known as Pineapple Guavas and Guavasteen, this flavour adds a nonce of pineapple, banana, mint, strawberry and guava which is the comparative combination of flavours which makes this fruit so unique. This flavour pairs well with stone fruits, berries and works perfectly in desserts, bakery, candy and even tobacco styled e-liquid recipes. This is definitely a must have to add to your exotic range of flavours. Be sure to check out our other range of exotic flavours. Perfect in a mix or as a standalone.\"\n\n**5%:** Freshly mixed get some sour pineapple like notes, green banana is there, also has a creamy banana like mouthfeel along with a banana after taste. Also a little on the dry side some slight throat tingling harshness.\nAfter a week of steeping this flavor seemed fully steeped me. The green banana note pushed its way forward, and is now the main note I get. Sourness is on the end of exhale. Also getting some mint like coolness as VTA said in their description. The dry/harshness was faintly present at 35 watts. So I rewicked my Goon and tested it at 100 watts. The harshness was far more present, but still light enough that it could be covered up in a mix.\n\n**7%** Harshness got a little stouter, but still tolerable. Sour & coolness were more pronounced. Not getting any of strawberry or guava that VTA described when vaped, but when tasted on back of hand. I can definitely tell a strawberry/guava is present.\n\n**Conclusion** Complex flavor with multi-layers of notes. Should be great for a wide range of usages in recipes. At 5&7% it was an overall pleasant single flavor test experience. \n\nThe recipe I tested this flavor in is one my own a Feijoa & Peach Rice Pudding\n\n<VT> (Apollo Feijoa) @3%\n\n<FA> (Peach) @1.5\n\n<FE> (Sweet Rice) @5%\n\n<FLV> (Vanilla Pudding) @2%\n\nThe Feijoa shines through the rice and pudding & the dryness is covered by the pudding and peach\n","author":"ebc88","title":"Apollo Feijoa","url":"https://redd.it/871m7e","vendor":{"name":"Vape Train Australia","code":"VTA"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"VTA","title":"Apollo Feijoa"}},
