I almost get an Orange Watermelon flavor from it, similar to INW Melon but a little better IMO. If I had to try to pick which melons I'm tasting I would say Watermelon, Honeydew, Cantaloupe. I'm not sure what exactly they were going for with this one but it came out really darn tasty. \n\n**On the Nose**  \nGetting mostly a scent of a sweet, perfectly ripe honeydew. Detecting banana (realistic, medium-ripe)? wtf?\n\n**Usage**  \n*Stand alone*: 2-3% for a tasty, full flavored melon vape.  \n\n*In a mix*: .5-2% depending on how prominent you want the melon.  \n\n**Throat**  \nModerate  \n\n**Pairings**  \nCreams (light on dairy note), Marshmallow, other melons, fruits.  \n\n**Avoid**  \nCoffee, creams with heavy dairy notes. This is a pretty bright flavor so I'd imagine overly \"dark\" flavors would clash.  \n\n**Steep**  \nWith this being a pretty bright fruit, it doesn't necessarily need to steep long, I'd say overnight for this one. Seems to hold it's own pretty well throughout a steep of a few weeks; haven't had a mix on hand last longer than 1m to see how it fares. \n\n**Quick Recipe: Melon Mix**  \n*Ratio: 10PG/90VG*  \n*Steep: 3+ days*  \n\n* FLV Wild Melon @ 1.5%  \n* FLV Cantaloupe @ 0.75%  \n* TFA Marshmallow @ 1%  \n* FLV Cream @ 1%  \n\nThis is just a quick recipe I vape to give an idea of how I like to use it. This mix IMO really lets the Wild Melon shine. *FLV Cantaloupe* is a great cantaloupe flavor that's almost creamy, which boosts the melon as well as accenting the creams. *TFA Marshmallow* adds some additonal creaminess and sweetens the mix up a bit. *FLV Cream* provides some nice creamy body while not being overbearing on dairy notes.  \n\nI've had success adding in TFA Honeydew, using FA Fresh Cream in place of FLV Cream, FA Meringue, etc. There are a lot of possible ways to take this sort of mix, so feel free to sub in your favorite creams, melons, etc.\n","author":"CheebaSteeba","title":"Wild Melon","url":"https://redd.it/4n9yyn","vendor":{"name":"Flavorah","code":"FLV"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"FLV","title":"Wild Melon"}},
