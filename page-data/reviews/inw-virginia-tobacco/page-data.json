From what I understand, the TA is nice.\n\n**Flavor Notes**\n\nSpecs:\n\n- 22 day steep\n\n- percentage used: 1, 3, 5%\n\n- PG/VG ratio: 40/60\n\n- vaped on Derringer RDA, 1.29 ohm coil, 10-18 watts\n\n**Flavor Properties:**\n\n- slightly sweet floral\n\n- no tobacco flavor to speak of, not even a hint\n\n**Relatable Flavors:**\n\n- rose water\n\n- honey\n\n**Mouth Feel:**\n\n- medium density\n\n- smooth floral sweetness\n\n**Off Flavors:**\n\n- I detect nothing but rose water and honey, neither is technically an off flavor but then again, neither of those are tobacco-esque soooo...\n\n**Position In A Recipe:**\n\n- condiment\n\n- could be used in low percentages to bring sweetness in place of honey\n\n**Pairings:**\n\n- maybe could be used to soften a very strong tobacco\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- not impressed\n\n- this is a condiment flavor if anything\n\n- has no nuance, no layers, yet the leading flavors (rose water and honey) fall short of greatness\n\n- no noticeable change in flavor from 1,3,5%.. only that the honey and rose water become more prevalent\n\n- at lower wattage, rose water takes front stage, higher wattage brings the honey forward\n\n- reminds me of one of the first wanna-be tobacco flavors I ever tasted.. it came with my Bloog cigalike circa 2012\n\n- this is subjective but I'm thoroughly disappointed\n\n**Suggested Percentage:**\n\n- 1-2%\n\n**Suggested Recipe:**\n\n- I honestly can't see myself reaching for this flavor any time soon\n\n**Note to reader**\n\n- If you've had success with this flavor please let me know! Also, if you taste anything other than what I described, I'd love to hear your thoughts!!\n\n- I doubt it's the review you would've wanted but I figured I'd put this out here anyway. Wasn't sure if I should bother posting a fairly negative review but what's the point of reviewing if we don't point out the bad ones too. Of course, you may find a use for this, it ain't all bad, but at least you'll know what you're getting into.
