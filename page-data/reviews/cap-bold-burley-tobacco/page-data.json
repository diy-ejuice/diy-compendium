Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** Capella Bold Burley Tobacco, 4% and 8%, 60/40 VG/PG base, Steeped 42 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** A sweet base, and darker, slightly herbal tobacco leaf finish.\n\nSo pretty common refrain after trying their [Original Blend](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/7ylse9/capella_original_blend_tobacco/) and [Smokey Tobaccos](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/7z4tov/capella_smokey_tobacco/), but this has that same heavily sweet, fluffy base to it.  Feels a bit like someone overdid FA Oba Oba with a tobacco base. Sweetness again is pretty front-loaded, with the tobacco coming through on the backend.\n\nI don't know if I would call it \"bold\" behind all that sweetness, but it does have more of a leafy tobacco flavor in here.  Darker tobacco, but it feels pretty subtle next to that big sweet base.   Light leathery note with a kind of numbing light licorice root finish.  The sweetness and the leaf flavor definitely pushes in a herbal direction, almost a really mellow sassafras vibe.    Kind of neutral tobacco flavor without any prominent grassy or nutty notes.  Nothing too dirty, ashy, or smokey in here.  Not as sour as the other Capella tobaccos.\n\n**Off-Flavors:**  Pretty heavily sweetened and fluffy for a tobacco.  Nothing unpleasant or chemical here.  Light numbing, anesthetic effect.\n\n**Throat Hit:**  Light, nothing major.\n\n**Percentage testing:**  At 4%, this leads with a heavy sweetness.  Tobacco on the back end is dark and non-descript.  Lighter herbal note but nothing dirty or overwhelming.\n\nAt 8%, a bit sweeter and definitely fluffier in texture. Tobacco picks up a more distinct leathery note, and that light herbal note has been fleshed out a bit more. Leather starts to come out, and that finish has picked up a bit of licorice.  Lightly numbing.\n\nJust based on these tests, I'd again be up to 10%+ with this as a solo flavor.  I'd go 6% as a primary flavor or 3% as an accent.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  Probably the closest of the Capella tobacco flavors to a satisfying solo tobacco vape. Still pretty heavily sweet, but the tobacco here works pretty well.\n\nWith the heavy sweetness, seems like more of a sweetener and texturizer for darker pipe tobacco flavors.  Lacking the sourness of the other Capella tobaccos, I'd throw heavier, moist, and funkier pipe tobaccos at this one.  This should lift them and dry them out while adding a solid sweetness.\n\n**Second Opinions:** Nah, not seeing anything out there.\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Bold Burley Tobacco","url":"https://redd.it/7zmg7z","vendor":{"name":"Capella","code":"CAP"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"CAP","title":"Bold Burley Tobacco"}},
