Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** INW Pink Panther @ 1%, 60/40 VG/PG, Steeped 19 days.\n\n**Flavor Description:** Inawera describes this as a mix of strawberry, rhubarb, and red currant. I get a full cooked raspberry with a rhubarb edge to it.  Concentrate is definitely heavier on the sweet berry side of things.\n\nInhale is tart and a bit bitter red berries. Moderate to light density, with a building sweetness. Moderately dense exhale starts with sweet almost syrupy raspberry flavor and has finishes with a dark cooked rhubarb, missing some of the astringency you'd expect.  Some lingering perfumey bitter notes.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  A whole lot of sweetness here. Definitely a more candy-like flavor, which isn't necessarily where my mind goes with rhubarb involved.\n\n**Throat Hit:** Almost none at a low percentage.\n\n**Uses & Pairings:** /u/Philosaphucker has a really good recipe named [\"RU Berry Jelly\"](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/21296#ru_berry_jelly_by_philosaphucker) that uses raspberry, rhubarb, and CAP Jelly Candy.  It's an awesome fit for CAP Jelly Candy, and I think this concentrate would be too. The overall flavor profile of the concentrate is close to the mix of FA Raspberry, TFA Dragonfruit, INW Shisha Strawberry, and INW Rhubarb used.  Maybe a bit sweeter, less developed, and less juicy for sure, but a similar profile.\n\nI'm an absolute sucker for rhubarb and red berries together (especially FA Raspberry and INW Rhubarb), so I liked this quite a bit.  With that said, I find this lacking when compared to a multi-flavor fruit mix. Having more control over the individual components would be better for a juicier fruit mix and the sharper green note of the single INW Rhubarb isn't really duplicated here.\n\nThis may be a better option for berry-rhubarb custards and bakeries. The overall sweetness and less sharp nature of the rhubarb already makes this seem a bit cooked and it will work better than the fresher taste of straight INW Rhubarb with those heavier flavors.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nThis is strong. I get a clear and strong flavor as low as .5%.  I'd mix at .75% for a main note, and as low as .25% for a supporting flavor behind other fruits.  Anything over 1% is just perfumey and harsh.\n\n**Second Opinions:**\n\nSome test reports on Inawera's forum here:(www.forum.inawera.com/viewtopic.php?f=158&t=4019&p=23607#p23607) Posts have an english translation along with the polish.\n\n[Couple of notes on ELR saying they get a custard.](http://e-liquid-recipes.com/flavor/103857)  Not sure where how they are tasting custard, but I don't get that at all.\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"ConcreteRiver","title":"Pink Panther","url":"https://redd.it/5k4r4u","vendor":{"name":"Inawera","code":"INW"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"INW","title":"Pink Panther"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
