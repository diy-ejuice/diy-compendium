I'm wondering if a higher percentage on this one might help strengthen the back notes, and it seems mild enough to bump up. I will wait to see how it steeps. After 2 weeks the flavor has deepened quite a bit, more medium strength than mild now. I'm tasting some type of dark fruit in the back that I didn't notice before. Cherry or plum maybe? The sweetness has stayed moderate with the longer steep. This has gone from a mild S&V to become a slightly heavier tobacco than the others, reminds me of a pipe tobacco. I still get an obvious vanilla flavor, followed by the fruit, backed with a very faint nut and wood note. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Off Flavors:** Slightly ashy for the first week.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Throat Hit:** 3/10\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Pairings:** Coffee, nuts, vanillas, caramels, berries or cherry, other tobaccos, some creams. brandy, whiskey, chai tea.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Notes:** Single flavor in an RDA at 3-6% and in a tank around 4-7%. Accent flavor in the 1-3% range.","author":"mysticrosell","title":"Tobacco Bourbon","url":"https://redd.it/5q9gqp","vendor":{"name":"Purilum","code":"PUR"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"PUR","title":"Tobacco Bourbon"}},
