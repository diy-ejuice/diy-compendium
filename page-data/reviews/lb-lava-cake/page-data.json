Don't expect any concrete level write up here :)*\n\n**Setup:** Narda Clone, Triple core alien (thanks loco) Nichrome 80 coil. 3x28g / 36g @.33 ohms.  45w power, Full Cotton Wicks.\n\n**Testing:** LB Lava Cake @4%, snv\n\n**Flavor Description:**  First off, I wanted to get this info out right away because I was excited about this flavor so it is not a full review. I mixed it up and loved it and looked right away to see if there was a review out for it. Since there isn't anything I thought I would bring it upon myself to spread the word.\n\n   This is a really good chocolate, finally! To me it tastes like the inside of a lava cake with maybe a crumb or two of the cake itself. It is a semi sweet chocolate with a bit of bakery behind it. I am assuming it is the ap ness of the flavor that actually is making this a decent chocolate. It is not overtly grainy so I think it could be covered up easily to turn this into a chocolate milk type flavor.\n\nThis is very smooth right on the shake and lingers in your palate a bit. It's not coat your mouth thick so can use some help with creams or sweetener if you want that lip smacking flavor. That being said, it does have enough inherent sweetness if you just want a chocolate accent to something, I don't think it needs any sweetener unless you are making the chocolate the main note.\n\n**Off-flavors:**  Not a one, this is all chocolate, all of the time, pure and simple. Pretty accurate to the profile it is going after but I would add some additional cake-y flavors to push this a little more. \n\n**Throat Hit:** Very smooth, no tingle at all, even on the shake\n\n**Uses & Pairings:**  I would comfortably use this wherever you want a chocolate. Whether you throw creams at this to make a chocolate milk or layer in your favorite fruit for one of those brooks candies I think this would be a good choice. Like I stated earlier this is just a first look so I haven't made many mixes with it. I think this and flv red velvet would get along wonderfully to make it a more true lava cake. \n\n\n\n**[DIY_eJuice Flavor Reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/index/flavor_reviews)**","author":"mlNikon","title":"Lava Cake","url":"https://redd.it/72wbyy","vendor":{"name":"Liquid Barn","code":"LB"}}},"pageContext":{"code":"LB","title":"Lava Cake"}},
