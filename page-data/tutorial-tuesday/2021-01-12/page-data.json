I wish it were that simple, dear reader…</em></li>\n</ol>\n<p>At the same time, I was a doe eyed member of Mixer’s Club in january of 2019, and had it set in my head I would try my hand at a Thin Mint recipe. Heavily influenced by the earlier version of what later became this gem of an article on <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/ds7pct/batch_testing_tutorial_tuesday/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Batch Testing Tutorial Tuesday</a> by u/mLnikon, I tried my hand at <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/1FiJRPp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">batch developing</a> what I thought at the time was a good approach. I sent in the best submission I could make at that time and got my first feedback that was more positive than I thought it would be. u/ID10-T, god bless his back-as-night soul, gave me some direction, waited patiently for me to throw in the towel and then suggested I try u/jbird’s <a href=\"https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/6997#skinny_mint_by_jbird\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Skinny Mint</a>. Spoiler Alert: It is perfection.</p>\n<p>While I was sad that I “couldn’t figure it out” myself, I was happy that I was halfway on the right track to trusting my tastes: FA Cookie, CdM, some kind of dark molassesey caramel type, bit of chocolate, some kind of custard or cream… I just didn’t have the right moving parts. Perhaps now you think: “Let this be thy lesson! Do thine research”, yet also “To Thine Own Self Be True!” Perhaps, yet the nuts and bolts learning lesson was that CdM and Choc Deutch are brothers in arms. They deliver. That, and, I wanted to give up. How was I ever going to make such wonderful finished mixes such as this, ever? And: Has Everything Great already been made?</p>\n<p>One year later, I volunteer to do Noted Ep. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Hj3PaNJVt4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">151</a> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/gibv9x/hey_all_you_cool_cats_and_kittens_its_tobacco/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">'Murica Fuck Yeah!</a> At that time I was deep in tobacco blends and experimenting with creating tobacco heavy RY4 from scratch and mint tobacco as a side experiment. The common thread with those flavors was that hint of chocolate, sometimes more than a hint. It drove me nuts. I really wasn’t expecting it and it was a series of tests that simply were not enjoyable to me. I ended up begrudgingly promoting the Mom and Pops because it had a licorice note yet, in retrospect, it wasn’t an exceptionally <em>good</em> licorice note, it just <em>was</em>. That alone made me like it more than the others after the wonky ass flavors I tried before it. So, here’s the thing. Were the flavors good/bad objectively? Or was it simply not what I was expecting? I never wanted to return to those flavors, except maybe TPA Western for this reason, some lingering resentment towards their failure to be other than weird tobacco blends with chocolate off notes.</p>\n<p>***Quick note about TPA Western: I like it. It’s not for everyone. Leather. No other flavor does it as well or even at all.

I digress…</em></p>\n<p>I tried Flavor Monks Mint Tobacco. At first taste, it was the mint tobacco flavor I had always been wanting. No thought involved. Mix and done. However, ID10-T is right in his review on Noted Ep. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/uVKD0ry8j-M?t=4326\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">177</a> Peppermint that the flavor could use a little help from some other tobacco to match the lighter notes that it carries and goes on to list a bazillion options and combinations. More on this in a minute.</p>\n<p>I’d already mentioned (<em>if you perhaps remember, dear reader, or have you slowly nodded off after donning your pajamas and sliding into your cozy slippers</em>) that I had been pursuing mint tobacco. A basic tobacco blend and add mint. Very simple. I tried a few: FLV cool menthol, FA Arctic Winter, FW Extreme Ice, INW Natural Mint, INW Mix Mint, and many more. Some worked a bit, some not as well. Nothing could capture the essence of what I truly wanted. Until I tried <a href=\"https://youtu.be/uVKD0ry8j-M?t=3370\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">LB White Chocolate Peppermint</a>. And like, u/mLnikon says, this flavor is a clear case of “the sum is better than the parts”. It’s a strange flavor that tastes both excellent on it’s own and fairly incomplete at the same time. It’s mostly peppermint with a dash of white chocolate and a whole lotta “What do you do with a flavor you don’t know what to do with?” As u/ID10-T always reminds me, we add it to a tobacco. Which is exactly what I set out to do.</p>\n<p>I started with trying to accent aspects of the WCPM in some weird ways and hit a combo I just loved. With no clear single tobacco flavor in it, I wanted a weird mix of off notes that would play under the blanket of mint and <a href=\"https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/188594#december_26th_by_nowar\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">December 26th</a> was born. In retrospect, I should have known it was incomplete and there was a space for that missing ingredient, that perfect tobacco. I would have thought something pipe-y but I just never felt the need to pursue it, so I felt it was good enough to share. I’d vape it and be happy so, fuck it. Until…one day, I accidentally one day dripped some of my <a href=\"https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/205284\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Frank's Vanilla Cohiba</a> on top. F’sVC was built just to accent the Cohiba and make it bold and shine. I was missing a true cigar flavor that hit the gritty bold mouthfeel that I want from a cigar. But when I had mixed the two recipes together? It was ridiculous. I had to look down at my mod. Eureka! Screaming naked down the streets like Archimedes, this was the secret to displacement. I knew this needed to happen.</p>\n<p><em>Dear Reader, have we lost you? Have you gone to the fridge to get some water, as your throat has become scratchy from anticipation?
