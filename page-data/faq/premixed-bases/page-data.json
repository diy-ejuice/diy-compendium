Whether you pick an 80/20 @ 3mg or 70/30 @ 6mg or even 50/50 @ 24mg you should know what you plan to add to the mix before you buy it, because the amount of flavor you add will dilute the base further toward the PG side (unless you're using the rare and rarely good VG based flavors) and also reduce the amount of nicotine in your final mix.</p>\n<p>You probably know your preferred VG/PG ratio, or the range that works best in the gear you use. After that you can determine the ideal VG % of your premix by looking at the average percentages of the recipes you plan to mix and adding their total % to the PG % of your premix. If the PG is over 50%, you've gone too far…</p>\n<p>The premixed base I see the most regret over purchasing has to be 50/50. It's rare that anyone has a preference of PG at over 50% of a mix, let alone the kind of gear that would work well with that ratio.

It's rare that anyone has a preference of PG at over 50% of a mix, let alone the kind of gear that would work well with that ratio. I've seen many new mixers come through asking how to make 50/50 work when mixing up a recipe @ 20% flavor and, well… it just doesn't work (unless you somehow enjoy 70% PG)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.liquidbarn.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Liquid Barn</a> may not have most of the flavors you need from something like the <a href=\"https://diyejuice.org/flavors/first-order\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">First Order Flavors</a> but after looking at the options for premixed bases (US) theirs seems to be the \"best\" for the price (<a href=\"https://www.liquidbarn.com/products/basic-eliquid?variant=19537592196\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">$7.99/500ml 3mg</a>) with <a href=\"https://www.e-liq.com/e-liquids/e-liquid-bases/e-liquid-bases-1-liter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">e-Liq</a> being a comparably priced choice.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mixing-with-your-premix\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#mixing-with-your-premix\" aria-label=\"mixing with your premix permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Mixing with your premix</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://e-liquid-recipes.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ELR</a> has made the process exceedingly easy thanks to the \"Use vape-ready nicotine base\" option; Simply enter the specs of your premix base <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/TKybPcT.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">like this</a>:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://juicebook.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/premix2.png\" alt=\"first step\"></p>\n<p>add in your recipe/one shot and it will output your final recipe and the resulting ratios <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/ia9AC9K.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">like this</a>:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://juicebook.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/premix3.png\" alt=\"second step\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"diy-premix\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#diy-premix\" aria-label=\"diy premix permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>DIY Premix</h3>\n<p>Once you've moved on to buying your bases separately you may find yourself enjoying the price break but still wanting to capture some of the convenience of having the base premixed.

But in the case of Bottle Shots you're given a bottle (of various sizes) to pour your base into. At its most convenient, you'll simply take your premixed base (ex. 80/20 @ 6mg) and fill your bottle shot all the way up. Shake it, steep it and voila, you've got eLiquid. If the recipe in the bottle shot is 20% (it will usually tell you) then your final mix will be 64/36 VG/PG @ 4.8mg.</p>\n<p>One Shots are mostly the same concept—-a recipe in a bottle, the main difference being you have to Bring Your Own Bottle and measure your one shot before adding the base.</p>\n<h4 id=\"making-your-own-one-shots-premixed-flavors\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#making-your-own-one-shots-premixed-flavors\" aria-label=\"making your own one shots premixed flavors permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Making your own One Shots (Premixed Flavors)</h4>\n<p>Both ELR &#x26; ATF have this option available.

But some people may have good reasons to need them, so hopefully this answers some of the questions related to using them.</p>","title":"FAQ - Premixed Bases"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
